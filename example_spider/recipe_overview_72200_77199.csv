instructions, 1. Place oil in a medium sauce pan break the vermicelli into inch-long pieces (I find it easy to lay on a chopping board & slice with a large chefs knife) and add to the pan.
2. Cook the vermicelli over a medium heat stirring occasionally. When the vermicelli has browned to a walnut colour -  about 5 minutes add the milk and almonds.
3. Gently bash the cardamom pods with a rolling pin or bottom of a heavy pan to release the seeds. Add the seeds to the cooking pan & add the sugar.
4. Cover and cook for 20 to 25 minutes over medium heat. The vermicelli will begin to soak up the milk. Check every 5 minutes to see how much milk has been absorbed & be careful to stir occasionally.
5. When the milk is almost completely absorbed turn the heat as low as will go & cook with the lid off for around 10 minutes or until the noodles are separated.
6. Serve warm in small bowls topped with the pistachios. To make this a creamy dessert you can also spoon over a little single cream or evaporated milk!
7. (If using the mixed fruit & nut add half of it at the time when the almonds are added & the remainder to decorate like the pistachios).,

3. Press into small patties as thin as you can possibly make them.  Mine are about five inches across when they're raw but shrink a lot during cooking.  I find pressing between two sheets of cling film (Saran Wrap or similar) helps me get a really fine patty in one piece.

instructions, 1. Combine flour and ghee in a small frying pan and fry this over medium heat for about 3 minutes. Take off from heat and keep aside. Mix sugar and egg with a fork and add to flour mixture. Return pan to heat and stirring constantly cook on medium-low heat until sugar is dissolved do not over cook the mixture. Remove from heat and keep aside to cool completely.
2. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl add water pouring it fast at the beginning to bind the flour. Then slowly add more water little by little and knead until soft dough is formed about 3 minutes. Place the dough on a work surface or in a shallow tray (parat) and knead well until very soft and pliable dough is formed about 5 minutes. Cover with a moist cloth and keep aside to rest in a warm place for at least 15-20 minutes.
3. Divide dough into 10 equal parts. Roll each part into a smooth ball. Cover the dough balls with moist cloth to prevent them drying out.
4. Working one at a time lightly coat one dough ball with a little dry flour and place it on floured work surface flatten it slightly and roll it out into a circle of 6-7 inches. Divide the cooled egg flour mixture into 10 parts. Spread one part evenly over the circle and roll it up into a long sausage. Carefully lift up the roll and place one end in the center of your palm. Wind the rest of the roll around it. Repeat with remaining balls. Keep the balls covered with moist cloth.
5. Start heating the tava or frying pan over medium heat. Working one at a time pick up a ball and place it on the floured work surface. Press the ball lightly but firmly to flatten it into a round disc turn to coat the other side with flour. Roll the disc into a very thin circle about 8-9 inches. pressing and stretching with the rolling pin with a brisk back-and-forth motion going from edge to edge to keep it circular. Dust the circle from time to time to prevent its sticking to the work surface or rolling pin.
6. To grease the tava put a little ghee on it and wipe it with kitchen towels. Lift the paratha carefully place it on the hot tava and cook until the side in contact with the tava is almost cooked about 30 seconds. Smear a little ghee on the surface and flip it with a spatula and grease the other side with a little ghee. When the underneath side is cooked about one minute turn paratha again and cook the other side again. It is essential to check and keep the tava at the right temperature at all times. If the tava is too hot the bread will brown quickly and will burn and if it is not hot enough it will take long time to cook and the paratha will become hard tough and leathery. 6. When the both sides of paratha are crisp and brown remove it from tava if desired spread with ghee and serve at once.
7. Warqi paratha goes well with sheikh kabab.,

5. Yes this is a long simmer for a chicken but these are the instructions I was given and when I tried it at home it tasted just like our meal at the camp. The potatoes should just about disintegrate which thickens the stock now turned sauce.
6. Note that the fat and bones from the chicken will disengage from the meat - not very palatable for our tastes but the Iraqi family seemed to have just ate around them. (I remove them and the cinnamon sticks before serving.).
7. Serve over rice. We like to add cooked or steamed vegetables over the rice before drowning it with the curry. Box of frozen broccoli works for us. Oh - they also served whole pita breads with this which they tore and passed on to one another to tear and pass and use as scoops. Neat!,

instructions, 1. Roughly chop the onion in quarters and fry in a little olive oilfor five minutes until it starts to brown peel the garlic bulbs use as many as you like but a lot is needed for this dish- no need to chop leave the garlic whole add them to the onions until all is well browned and softened - 15 minutes on a low heat will do it.
2. In a separate pan brown the lamb in batches and when they are nicely coloured add to onion garlic. Leave the juices in the pan until later as will fry the okra. When all the meat has been browned add them to the onions and garlic and season.
3. Then pour the stock into a jug and add the tomato puree or paste and stir in the tamarind making sure this is well mixed (the tamarind gives the stock a nice reddish brown colour). I have had this dish bright orange cooked by a native Iraqi lady but my husband assures me he thinks the colour is wrong and tamarind wasn't used hence the colour. Of course he prefers mine!
4. Pour the stock over the onionsgarlic meat. Bring to the boil and simmer for however long you have got I usually leave the dish for minimum 45 minutes.
5. 20 minutes before you want to serve cut up the okra either in  half or if very long 3 lengths.  Then brown the okra in the pan with the meat juices.  It takes about 5 minutes to colour--this also releases a serum in the okra which will thicken up the dish.
6. Add to the main dish also add the chopped parsley now; cover the dish and leave for remaining time on a low heat.  If bubbling too much slant the lid to let out heat.  I serve with pilau rice and warm pitta bread.,

4. Notes: If an avocado has a 'neck' rather than being rounded at the top it was probably tree-ripened and will have better flavour.  To ripen a firm avocado place it in a paper bag at room temperature for a couple of days.  Don't refrigerate avocados until they are ripe.  To prevent the flesh from turning brown sprinkle with lemon juice. In Australia there are now varieties of avocado which don't brown after being cut but I do wonder (I don't know) if they have been genetically modified.,

instructions, 1. Position your oven rack in the bottom third of the oven and preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with aluminum foil.
2. Using a small saucer or the rim of a large glass trace 3 (4" diameter) circles onto the foil on each baking sheet using a food-safe waterproof marker or pencil.  Lightly butter the foil.  Set the baking sheets aside.
3. In the bowl of a standing electric mixer beat the egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until foamy.  Carefully begin adding the superfine sugar one tablespoon at a time and increase the speed to medium-high.  Continue to beat until the egg whites are stiff and glossy about 7 minutes.  Turn the mixer off and using a spatula transfer the meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2 inch plain tip.
4. Using the traced circles on the foil as guides carefully pipe concentric circles of the meringue onto the buttered foil so that the circles are completely filled with the meringue.  Pipe a second and then a third ring of meringue around the top outermost ring of each circle to form a shallow cup space.  Place 1 tbsp of the confectioner's sugar in a fine-mesh sieve and shake the sugar evenly over the tops of the meringues.
5. Bake the meringues 1 1/2 to 2 hours until crisp.  They will not color.  Turn the ove off and leave the meringues in the oven to cool and continue crsiping for at least 4 hours and up to overnight.  They should feel very light.  Remove the cool baking sheets from the oven and remove the meringue cups from the baking sheets by carefully peeling them off of the foil.  Transfer to an airtight container if storing.  Meringues may be made up to several days in advance and kept in an airtight container until ready to serve.
6. Make the strawberry puree by combininb 2 cups of the strawberries with the 3 tbsp granulated sugar and the lemon juice in a blender or food processor and blend until very smooth about 2 minutes.  Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium mixing bowl and discard the solids.  Transfer the sauce to a nonreactive measuring cup or small glass bowl and chill until ready to serve.
7. If desired place the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat on medium-low until slightly thickened.  Turn the mixer off and add the remaining 2 tbsp confectioners' sugar.  Beat on low speed until the sugar is incorporated and then increase the speed to medium high.  Continue to beat until stiff peaks form.  Chill the whipped cream until ready to assemble the desserts.
8. When you are ready to serve place each of the meringue cups on individual dessert plates and fill each with 2/3 cup of the remaining assorted berries.  Top each with1/3 cup of whipped cream if desired and then spoon some of the strawberry sauce over the top.
9. Serve immediately.,

instructions, 1. You will need 8 bamboo skewers for this recipe.  Before you start soak them in hot water for appproximately 20 minutes.
2. Slice the steak lengthways into 5mm thick strips.  When you lay them flat they will be 2.5 cm wide and about 12 cm long depending upon the length of your steak.  Place the steak strips into a bowl with the soy sauce sugar and vinegar.  Stir well together and leave to marinate for at least 15 minutes and up to 2 hours.
3. Meanwhile make the satay sauce: place the peanuts and the garlic and the food processor and whizz until very finely chopped.  Add the coconut cream and whizz again until well blended.  Pour into a small pan and heat gently for 3-4 minutes until the sauce darkens and thickens slightly.  Add the soy sauce and lime juice to taste then remove from the heat.
4. Thread the steak onto the bamboo skewers-make a concertina with each strip so that each skewer passes through several times-and place on a foil lined baking sheet.  Cook under a hot grill for 2-3 minutes on each side until browned but still pink in the centre.  You can cook them longer if you like your steak beeter done.
5. Pour the warm satay sauce into a serving bowl and sprinkle with the crushed chillies.  Arrange the beef sticks on a platter garnish with corriander or salad onions and serve with the sauce for dipping.,

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat a large skillet or griddle on medium heat.
2. 2. Lightly butter one side of bread slices. Spread non-buttered sides with Thousand Island dressing. On 4 bread slices layer 1 slice Swiss cheese 2 slices corned beef 1/4 cup sauerkraut and second slice of Swiss cheese. Top with remaining bread slices buttered sides out.
3. 3. Grill sandwiches until both sides are golden brown about 15 minutes per side. Serve hot.
4. My Update Notes:    I drained the sourkraut but didn't rinse it because we like the tangy taste of the sourkraut. I buttered rye bread slices on one side and spread Thousand Island dressing on the other side. On the dressing side I placed a slice of swiss cheese sliced Pastrami from the deli and then topped with sourkraut. I cooked them on my grill until the cheese was melted and the bread was nice and toasted. They were delicious! I only gave the four star rating because the sourkraut in the middle wasn't very warm. Next time I make these I will warm the sourkraut in the microwave first and maybe add another slice of swiss too! I made was to heat the sauerkraut in the microwave for 20 seconds before adding to the sandwich. I like my sandwich warmed all the way through. I would recommend keeping a good eye on your bread and toast it to your liking. If you like Rueben sandwiches you will love this one!,

instructions, 1. 1. In a large saucepan over medium heat mix together the ketchup tomato sauce brown sugar wine vinegar molasses liquid smoke and butter. Season with garlic powder onion powder chili powder paprika celery seed cinnamon cayenne salt and pepper.
2. 2. Reduce heat to low and simmer for up to 20 minutes. For thicker sauce simmer longer and for thinner less time is needed. Sauce can also be thinned using a bit of water if necessary. Brush sauce onto any kind of meat during the last 10 minutes of cooking.
3. My Note:   It's thick sweet and spicy and beautiful in color! To try it out.first I cut the servings to 12. I followed the scaled measurements except only used a pinch of cayenne and chili powder. Concern was it may be too spicy for kids. I did not have celery seed so I had to leave it out. If you like a sweet and spicy sauce you must try this recipe. I will use this on chicken pulled pork and ribs. UPDATE: I've made this again using the celery seed and think I like the taste without it. Also for a nice thick sauce it is necessary to simmer on low for at least 20 minutes. And advice to anyone wanting to make it don't leave out the liquid smoke! I didn't have any so I was just going to leave it out but then my son offered to buy me some and when we added it it was SO much better and really added to the flavor. Only suggestions are that oil can be substituted for the butter or left out alltogether the molasses can be reduced and it's still sweet and the chili powder cayenne and pepper should probably be doubled. Red pepper is also wonderful for the flavor.
4. I am helping in catering a wedding reception the end of this month and needed a sauce I could call my own so my kitchen was tore up from the floor up! I measured the spices and saved them for later then I mixed up the liquids over a slow flame I did not have any red wine vinegar but I did have some marsala I mixed 1/4c. and the balance I used of white vinegar I did not add the butter I figured the fat from the meat would be enough and I wanted it to have some table time. The sauce tasted good but it had no depth I only used 3 teaspoons of liquid smoke and let it simmer for a while. Once I added the spices it was the bomb! This is the best sauce I have ever tasted. The spices are fantastic! Whoever thought cinnamon would work in a bbq sauce? I told my husband we have to go get a piece of meat to go with the sauce. Thanks for sharing this is great! I also simmered it for about 1 1/2 hours to thicken Uuummm finger licken good! I will serve it with pulled pork and baked chicken I am sure you could serve this with fingernails and toe-jams.
5. I made just as is (but halved the recipe= 1 1/2 C) and I simmered it for about 50 minutes. The next day it was nice and thick. The liquid smoke is a great flavor in this (a must!) and mellows out by the next day. I also used a pinch of cayenne so the kids could eat it. I used this on some pulled pork next it'll go on grilled chicken. Next time I'll make the full batch to keep on hand.,

instructions, 1. 1. Combine beef veal and pork in a large bowl. Add garlic eggs cheese parsley salt and pepper.
2. 2. Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture. Slowly add the water 1/2 cup at a time. The mixture should be very moist but still hold its shape if rolled into meatballs. (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water). Shape into meatballs.
3. 3. Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Fry meatballs in batches. When the meatball is very brown and slightly crisp remove from the heat and drain on a paper towel. (If your mixture is too wet cover the meatballs while they are cooking so that they hold their shape better.).
4. My Note:   I use all beef most of the time. I don't fry b/c I am too impatient and the meatballs break up more that way. I scoop them out with a spoon roll them in my hands and bake on a cake rack in the oven over a foil-lined cookie sheet. This way they brown nicely excess fat is drained off and they can go right into sauce or in our family meatball hoagies along with sauteed onions and peppers. They also freeze very well when baked this way.
5. funny! 3 meats the breadcrumbs plus 1 egg. You can also use fresh chopped spinach instead of parsley (or 1 pkg frozen thawed and all water squeezed out) and pecorino romano cheese instead of parmesan. I make sure I have these on hand almost all the time I use one lb of EACH meat and it makes 30-40. Instead of frying I par bake mine on a cookie sheet at 325 for about 10 minutes then set the tray (if room allows) into the freezer for an hour or so. Pop them off the tray into a couple of large freezer bags. Meatballs on demand! Drop them into a sauce or steam in a glass casserole dish for about 5 minutes they will be medium-well on the inside. Absolute crowd pleaser if you are making a big Italian dinner!
6. Sometime I used at meatloaf mix (beef/pork/veal) and added 2 TBSP of parmesan cheese and 2 tsp crushed garlic for extra flavor. Baked them according to the recipe then put them in a pot of sauce to simmer for a couple hours.,

instructions, 1. 1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cut the tops off the peppers and remove the seeds. Cook peppers in boiling water for 5 minutes; drain. Sprinkle salt inside each pepper and set aside.
2. 2. In a large skillet saute beef and onions for 5 minutes or until beef is browned. Drain off excess fat and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the tomatoes rice 1/2 cup water and Worcestershire sauce. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until rice is tender. Remove from heat and stir in the cheese.
3. 3. Preheat the oven to 350*F. Stuff each pepper with the beef and rice mixture and place peppers open side up in a baking dish. In a medium bowl combine tomato soup with just enough water to make the soup a gravy consistency. Pour over the peppers.
4. 4. Bake covered for 25 to 35 minutes until heated through and cheese is melted and bubbly.
5. My Note:   I play with the recipe some. I halved the peppers (lengthwise) sauted onions separately along with 2 minced garlic pieces cooked the rice separately used 1 can of DICED tomatoes* (why would you ever buy a can of tomatoes and THEN dice them?) and mixed the ingredients together after browning the beef** allowing them to warm slightly in the skillet before stuffing into the peppers. You can use the extra juice from the can of tomatoes to keep the rice from burning. I also added quite a bit of basil oregano and Italian seasoning as well as extra Worcestershire sauce. Putting just a little cheese in the bottom of each pepper helped as well. Lastly I only used one can of tomato soup. Even cut in half 25 min was needed to get them nice & hot. Next time I'll try adding some pepper as well. * Using a can of diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers adds just the right amount of kick to these! **You can also use 1/2 beef & 1/2 3-7% lean ground turkey to reduce fat content -- tastes the same!
6. I'll definitely make this again. I used ground turkey instead of beef and a can of petite diced tomatoes w/ liquid instead of whole toms. Used Arborio rice as that's what I had in the pantry. Added minced garlic to the meat mixture. I substituted 1/2°C of beef broth instead of plain water. Used 1 can of tomato soup & 1 sm. can of tomato sauce w/ a TBS or two of Spaghetti Sauce Seasoning. Excellent healthy and much better than the stuffed peppers. I think that par-boiling the peppers before stuffing them was key to the texture and flavor.,

2. 2. In a medium bowl mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter. Press onto bottom of springform pan.
3. 3. In a large bowl mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in milk and then mix in the eggs one at a time mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream vanilla and flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.
4. 4. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours; this prevents cracking. Chill in refrigerator until serving.
5. My Note:   OK KID's one more time - I don't want to be rude But this is the deal: This is a perfect recipe and if it fails for you it's your Fault not the recipe's. A couple of things you should know about cheesecakes: OVERBEATING WILL CAUSE A CHEESECAKE TO CRACK. Beat cream cheese with sugar only until smooth. Proceed with a wooden spoon for the rest of the recipe. OVERBEATING WILL CAUSE A CHEESECAKE TO HAVE THE "WRONG" TEXTURE. Air bubbles gritty/not creamy texture etc. are fixed my the same instructions above. OVERCOOKING WILL CAUSE A CHEESECAKE TO CRACK. Do NOT cook this cheesecake until it's set. Matter of fact don't check it at all. Put the cheesecake in the oven set the timer to 60 min. turn the oven off and forget it. I mean it! Don't open the oven just leave it alone to do its thing. And that's it. A beautiful cheesecake. Far from bland: this is a PURIST'S cheesecake. It's great as is but also a great foil for other flavours. I serve mine with passionfruit pulp or mango puree. I've made cheesecakes many times only to have them crack and sink after cooling. With the tips that I picked up on Chantal's New York Cheesecake was a hit with my family & friends. After cooling the top remained level and the center firmed up. The top was a beautiful golden brown with no dry edges. The inside was creamy and smooth and not too sweet. The tips are as follows: 1. Make sure that your ingredients are around room temperature not cold otherwise your batter will be lumpy. 2. Wrap your springform pan with 2 layers of aluminum foil to prevent water in the bain marie (water bath) from seeping inches 3. Place your springform pan in a water bath in the oven filled with 1 inch of very hot water then proceed to bake as instructed in the recipe. 4. Right after baking run a warm or greased knife around the rim of the cake to prevent cracking while cooling. 5. Leave the cake in the oven for 2 hours to cool. (I didn't have time to leave it in for the recommended 6 hrs and it still works.) I'll make variations of this cheesecake such as blueberry topping oreo base and filling etc.
6. To Me this is The No.1 KING of all cheesecakes! This is the recipe you are looking for Thick and Creamy! Ive made this 2X now with tremendous sucess. YES! However I found this crust to need some work so this is the recipe I use: 1 1 /2 Celsius graham cracker crumbs 1/2 Celsius white sugar 1/4 Celsius finely chopped Unsalted nuts (walnuts pecans) 1/4 Celsius melted butter 1 teaspoons cinnamon and a 1/4 teaspoons nutmeg. Mix together and press into 9" springform pan. As for the cheesecake mixture make Sure to start with room temperature ingredients use a mixer to beat cream cheese and sugar then hand-mix from there on. Feel free to add chocolate chips toffee bits etc. to the mixture before transferring into graham cracker crust. Use a water bath (See Cheesecake section under Cooking Basics on this site) with the pan double wrapped in foil. When cheesecake is done turn oven off run knife around edge of the cake to completely loosen from the pan. Close oven door leave in for 3+ hours until completely cool. Refrigerate overnight. I make a homemade raspberry topping as follows: 1 10oz. pkg frozen raspb. 2 tblsp. white sugar 2 teaspoons cornstarch & 1/2 Celsius water. In med. saucepan mix sugar & corn starch well. Add water & bring to a boil. Add raspberries & boil for 5 minutes or until thick. If you wish strain the hot mixture to remove seeds. Place in refrigerator to completely cool. Place 1-2 tablespoons over chilled cheesecake top with a curl of white chocolate. And YES it is a Award Winning!  ENJOY!
7. Why Mine didn't crack I was careful not to overmix and had the cream cheese at room temperature and these are supposed to help prevent cracking. I also used a water bath and I made sure that the side of the springform pan not just the bottom was well greased. (The cheesecakes shrink from the sides of the pan as they cool and if the side isn't well greased the cheesecake will stick and thus crack.) I have baked it at 325*F. and made the crust as follows: 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs 1/4 cup melted butter 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon and 1/4 cup sugar. I substituted Bailey's Irish Cream for the milk. I had a can of cherry pie filling available for those who wanted a topping. A picture-perfect cheesecake!,

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat oven to 350*F.
2. 2. Crush garlic with rosemary salt and pepper making a paste. Pierce meat with a sharp knife in several places and press the garlic paste into the openings. Rub the meat with the remaining garlic mixture and olive oil.
3. 3. Place pork loin into oven turning and basting with pan liquids. Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145*F. Remove roast to a platter. Heat the wine in the pan and stir to loosen browned bits of food on the bottom. Serve with pan juices.
4. My Note:   I cheated. I browned the roast then put it in the crock pot and dumped the minced garlic you know the stuff in a jar and the rosemary on top of the roast and then cut holes in it a kinda pushed the stuff inside and left some on top too. I didn't make a paste. Then I drizled a little olive oil on tbe top added salt pepper and accent. Threw some dehydrated minced onions on top. Added the wine and cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hours It came out just as good if not better then the first time. This is the absolute best pork roast. I'm not even sure if I used a loin. I used that big giant pork roast and cut it and made 3 roasts out of it. Not the small loin cut.
5. I've made a couple of adjustments to it. The first time I made it I made exactly like the directions stated. Although I used a meat thermometer because my loin was perfect in 1 1/2 hours The second time I made this I pureed 4 cloves of garlic 1/2 of the rosemary and enough olive oil to bind it together. I rubbed my pork loin w/ the paste then put in a ziploc bag in the fridge for a few hours to marinate. YUM! I threw in some veggies with my loin (carrots onions and celery) and poured about 1/4 cup of wine in the bottom of the pan. Roasted for about 1.5 hours covered and everything was perfect! I scooped out the veggies and then used a can of chicken stock and some cornstarch to make a gravy out of the pan drippings. I served with buttered herb rice and the roasted vegetables. BIG hit!,

instructions, 1. In a saucepan combine the mango wine sugar ginger and lime juice and simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes until thick and syrupy.  Add the cream mix well and remove from the heat.  Pour into a blender and blend until smooth (or use an immersion blender).  Return to the saucepan and simmer over low heat for 8 minutes until the mixture thickens slightly.  Add the butter a piece at a time and stir until incorporated before adding the next piece.  Be careful not to boil the sauce or it will separate.  Season with salt and pepper and keep warm.
2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
3. Place the nuts panko and basil in a food processor and process until fine.  Spread on a plate.  In a bowl combine the mayonnaise and Sriracha (chile paste) and mix well.  Lightly season the fish with salt and pepper.  Evenly spread a light coat of the chile mayonnaise on one side of each fish fillet.  Coat the same side evenly with the nut coating.
4. In an ovenproof saute pan or skillet pour in just enough oil to coat the bottom and heat over medium heat. (Be careful not to heat the pan too hot or the macadamia nuts will burn).  Add the fish crust side down and saute for 3 minutes until golden brown.  Turn the fish and place in the oven for 5 minutes until cooked through and firm to the touch.
5. Place the fillets on warmed individual places.  Serve with the mango-lime butter.,

instructions, 1. 1) To make the dip: Melt the butter in a medium frying pan over moderate heat and add the sliced onions. Cook stirring occasionally until the onions soften then caramelize. This should take between 10 and 15 minutes. The lower the heat the longer it takes but the less likely you are to burn the onions.
2. 2) Once the onions are a medium brown remove from the heat and add the vinegar.
3. 3) Place the onions and vinegar into a small food processor. Add the honey and mustard and process or blend until smooth.
4. 4) Add the mayonnaise and salt and pepper to taste stirring to combine. Refrigerate covered until ready to serve.
5. My Note:   I added a little garlic and onion powder because we like the flavor. The second time I made it I decided to add 2 cloves of garlic and it turned out even tastier than the first time.
6. I served the dip along with some raw carrots as well baked zucchini sticks were tasty and the onion dip was a hit and it was well liked. It took closer to 45 minutes for the onions to be caramelized. At 10-15 minutes the onions weren't even light brown yet. In caramelizing onions patience seems to be is a virtue. Perhaps I missed a secret step along the way.,

2. 2. To solve the runniness problem. You must drain the yogurt in a colander for a few hours. This is the way they do it the Greek restaurants. You should also salt and drain the cucumbers for an hour. I tried this recipe and drained the yogurt first.
3. My update Note:  PLEASE NOTE: yogurt will break down if it is stirred with too much force--especially using a food processor! This is why some people had runny results even after draining the yogurt overnight. Instead chop everything else up separately and gently fold it into the yogurt with a spatula.,

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat oven to 375*F. Line 36 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. 2. In a large bowl mix together the flour sugar cocoa baking soda and 1 teaspoon salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the eggs 1 cup milk water oil and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Mix well. Fill each muffin cup half-full of batter.
3. 3. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
4. 4. Make filling: In a large bowl beat butter and shortening together until smooth. Blend in confectioners' sugar and pinch of salt. Gradually beat in 3 tablespoons milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla. beat until light and fluffy. Fill a pastry bag with a small tip. Push tip through bottom of paper liner to fill each cupcake.
5. My Notes:  Here is the EASIEST tip for filling the cupcakes. Take an APPLE CORER and use that to pull a cylindrical plug of cake out of each cupcake (once they've cooled). Save the plugs on the side while you pipe filling into each hole you've created. "Plug" up each hole using the plugs/caps you had removed with the apple corer. Simple and fast!
6. I'd use a different recipe for that part next time. The cream filling was great so I wound up using a double batch of filling for one batch of cupcakes. I didn't like the idea of pushing it in from the bottom (sounded way too messy for me). So I used a knife and cut a cone shape out of the top spooned the filling in and replaced the top. (Just be sure to wait until the cupcakes have cooled or the cream filling just melts!) Then I frosted them using the great chocolate frosting recipe mentioned and you can't tell they're anything but chocolate cupcakes until you bite into them.
7. All you need is a pastry bag and tip. Each cupcake takes about 10 seconds to fill. I made my cupcakes in the pan without wrappers filled them after they were cool then arranged a dozen or so to a platter and drizzled them with chocolate ganache. They looked surprisingly elegant for cupcakes. Everyone loved them and ate seconds and thirds. I can't wait to try the same cupcake recipe with different fillings. UPDATE: I have made these cupcakes dozens of times since my first review because they are always requested. I like to ice them with Satiny Chocolate Glaze. I have also filled them with chocolate cream cheese frosting nutella and whipped peanut butter frosting. I like to fill them from the top and then spoon the glaze on. After the glaze is set I pipe a small flower in the center of each cupcake with whatever filling I used.,

(2) Sprinkle the chopped chocolate bar over the cupcakes just prior to serving as once it is exposed to the air honeycomb can become sticky.,

instructions, 1. Set your oven to 200°C (400°F). Grease 2 small ovenproof dishes or ramekins with butter and place them on a baking tray.
2. Chop the chocolate if necessary and place in a microwaveable dish. Add the butter and microwave in 30-second bursts until melted. In my microwave it takes 2 minutes on medium power. Remove stir gently and allow to cool a little (to avoid making chocolate scrambled eggs).
3. In a medium bowl beat the eggs and sugar together with the salt and vanilla until very well combined. You could use a handheld mixer though I prefer to do it by hand with a balloon whisk because it's quieter and more pleasant.
4. Stir in the slightly cooled chocolate then mix in the flour until just combined. Do not over-beat.
5. Divide the mixture between the dishes and cook for 12 minutes. Check that the top is just beginning to crack and remove from the oven. Let them sit for 5 minutes before serving turning them out onto a plate if you want to.
6. While these are perfectly delicious just the way they are you could serve them with cream or vanilla ice cream to suit your mood.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. Combine the flour baking powder and salt.
3. Unwrap the butter and heat it in the microwave in a microwave-safe bowl for about a minute until it's thoroughly melted. Set it aside at room temperature to cool but don't let it solidify again.
4. Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and then add the sugar milk and vanilla to the eggs.
5. Thoroughly grease and flour a muffin pan (or use paper muffin liners).
6. Pour a tiny bit of the melted butter into the egg-vanilla-milk mixture and stir it inches Repeat 3-4 more times adding a slightly larger amount of the liquid butter each time until it is all incorporated.
7. IMPORTANT: Don't add hot melted butter to the egg mixture as the heat from the butter would cook the egg and that's not what you want to do!
8. Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ones and mix no more than ten seconds. The batter should be visibly lumpy and you may see pockets of dry flour. That's OK! It's extremely important not to overmix the batter or the resulting muffins will be too hard.
9. Gently pour the batter into the prepared muffin pan and bake immediately.
10. My TIP's: The dry and wet ingredients respectively can be mixed in advance but as soon as the wet and dry ingredients have been combined with each other the liquid will activate the baking powder and the batter must be baked right away.
11. Bake 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
12. Note: The muffin was extremly thick and too sweet for me and my friends (15/16 year olds) The first time I made it it was too sweet and too thick. The second time I made them today and I added 1/10 less sugar and 1/10 more milk and mixed much less. I also added a little splash more of vanilla. Some added apple chunks and 1 tablespoons cinnamon and they were delicious!

Add boiling water stirring constantly. cook over low heat till thick and smooth. remove from heat add butter and vanilla. (I find I need to at least double this recipe!).

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees and prepare you muffin trays (I line mine with patty pans).
2. Put the apples and the pitted dates into the TMX bowl and chop for 10 seconds on speed 4 (or until chopped into fine pieces).
3. Scrape the chopped apples and dates out of the bowl into a separate bowl/container. (you don't need to clean the TMX bowl entirely- just get as much out as you can) You need to do this or you will continue to chop these down during the next part. They will be added again later!
4. Place all remaining ingredients straight into the TMX bowl and mix for 40 seconds on speed 4-5. (**I know it's a silly point and everyone knows- but just remember to reset your scales after each ingredient addition).
5. Now add back in your chopped apples and dates and mix for 1 minute on speed 1 (or until all ingredients are combined. If your ingredients aren't combined increase the time NOT the speed until they are combined. Increasing speed will chop down apples and dates even more- we don't want that!).
6. Divide mixture into your muffin trays (lined with patty pans) approximately 3/4 full as they will rise slightly and bake in the oven for 25 minutes or until firm in the center. Allow to cool.,

2. 2. Remove from the refrigerator 15 minutes before serving. Serve with crackers.
3. My Note:   I used 3/4 teaspoons fresh ground garlic pepper instead and also as others had suggested added the bacon to the cheese ball then rolled it in parsley before serving.
4. I like to grate cheddar cheese because it mixes into the cream cheese better. I also just mix the bacon pieces into the ball that way every one gets bacon with their cheese.
5. I made this as one on my appetizers for a large group. it was very good. Most cheese balls are rolled in nuts preventing allergy sufferers from having some. This was great because these people could actually enjoy this appetizer. I would recommend it to others.
6. I served this with 2 other appetizers so it didn't get all eaten but it was over half gone. I did steam the broccoli first just because I prefer the flavor of cooked to raw. I also added some Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning and paprika just to add a little spice.,

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat oven to 400*F. and turn at least once during the baking.
2. 2. Cut potato into wedges. Mix olive oil paprika garlic powder chili powder and onion powder together. Coat potatoes with oil/spice mixture and place on a baking sheet and they need to be turned 1/2 way through baking.
3. 3. Bake for 30-45 minutes in preheated oven. Cooking time and temperature will vary greatly on how thick you cut the wedges.
4. My Note:   Update: bake at 450*F. for 40-45 minutes and turn at least once during the baking. If you use the 450*F. in the recipe the fries will burn. I mixed everything in a gallon size ziploc bag. For the spices I used freshly minced garlic (no onion powder) paprika cumin cayenne pepper and chili powder. I used 6 potatoes (4 russet 2 sweet) and 1/3 cup oil. I have cut the potatoes into sticks like normal fries and then baked them for 15 minutes turned them over and baked for another 15 minutes (the whole time at 425 since they're thinner than wedges) and I must say these are the tastiest fries ever! I also added salt and freshly ground pepper and garlic salt and didn't measure it out- just kinda put on as much as looked good and wow were they tasty! I think the chili powder was what really put them over the top so don't be shy with it and remember that seasonings seem to lose some of their flavors when baked (which means put on more than you usually would)!
5. So if you cut your wedges small and thin - you will need to cut the temp and cooking time. But if you cut true (thick) wedges - follow the recipes directions (although I strongly encourage flipping the potatoes halfway through the process). For a super easy cleanup - I poured the oil and spices into a gallon size Ziploc bag and mixed it all together until well blended - then I added the cut potatoes and kneaded and shook the bag until all the potatoes were well and evenly coated. Then poured it into a 9x13 glass baking dish lined with foil. Minor adjustments: I used paprika garlic powder salt freshly ground black pepper a pinch of chili powder - mine is exceptionally potent and cumin) --  The second time making this recipe I added fresh minced onion - and that was a very tasty addition too!
6. FOR THOSE WHO THINK THIS RECIPE TOO BLAND: Take one onion for every 3 potatoes. Cut it in half lengthwise and cut it into slivers. Take all ingredients including the onions and put them in a zipper bag. Knead and shake until ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Proceed with recipe directions. The onions add quite a bit of zing as well as nutrition!
7. I use my french fry cutter to cut the potatoes. I don't even measure the spices anymore. I bake them at 400* for 15 min then flip and bake for another 15 on the other side. However I like my fries less on the crispy side also using the french fry cutter makes all the fries about the same size for uniform cooking.,

instructions, 1. Trim excess fat from ribs. Combine dry ingredients and rub over the surface of the ribs. Place ribs in slow cooker or Crock-Pot standing on their edge with the meaty side out. Cook for about 8 hours. Remove ribs from slow cooker and brush with barbecue sauce.
2. My Note:   THE ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENTLY WAS THAT I TURNED OFF THE SLOW COOKER AND I REMOVED THE RIBS. I PLACED THEM ONTO A FLAT TRAY LINED WITH FOIL WITH MINIMAL JUICE FROM THE SLOW COOKER. I PRE-HEATED THE OVEN TO 380 AND I BRUSHED THE RIBS WITH SWEET RAYS BBQ SAUCE ( WE LOVE THIS BBQ SAUCE) AND WE BAKED THEM FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES TO FIRM THEM UP A BIT AND GLAZE THEM. THEY WERE AWESOME.
3. First we cooked for 6.5 hours on low and the ribs came out moist and falling off the bone tender. Any longer and they would have not have held together. Second we also coated lightly in BBQ sauce when they came out and then put them under the broiler for 7 minutes. That way the outside was crispy and BBQ-like but the inside was moist and so so tender. When we make again we'll take them out after 6 hours which is plenty on low! My wife said they are the best she's ever had and my mother-in-law wanted the recipe!,

instructions, 1. 1. Place water milk egg 1/3 cup butter sugar salt flour and yeast in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select Dough/Knead and First Rise Cycle; press Start.
2. 2. When cycle finishes turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 12 inch circle spread 1/4 cup softened butter over entire round. Cut each circle into 8 wedges. Roll wedges starting at wide end; roll gently but tightly. Place point side down on ungreased cookie sheet. Cover with clean kitchen towel and put in a warm place let rise 1 hour. Meanwhile preheat oven to 400*F.
3. My Note:  I'm always asked to bring the rolls to get-togethers. I've used it for cinnamon rolls monkey bread -- almost everything. I do cheat however; normally I cut the dough into 36 pieces and place 3 into each cup of a muffin tin. It makes big light clover leaf rolls that everyone raves over. don't have a breadmaker so I made these the traditional way (dissolve yeast and 1 tbsp sugar in warm water let sit for about 10 minute Meanwhile warm milk in saucepan until it just bubbles. Remove from heat stir in sugar and butter until melted and cool to lukewarm. In a large bowl combine yeast mixture milk mixture and egg. Stir in flour a little at a time and knead on lightly floured surface about 8 min.) Cover and let rise about 1 hr -- punch down and then roll out. I baked at 375 for 12 min but could have used a tad longer. Still very good. he dough was too sticky in the machine so I sprinkled flour into it until it was smooth. I was concerned about not using bread machine flour or bread machine yeast. I used the all purpose flour as it called for but I used the bread machine yeast -- it was all I had. I used 2 1/2 tsp of bread machine yeast. They rose just fine and taste great. I will use this recipe to replace my old bread machine roll recipe. As did another reviewer I cut my dough into 36 pieces and placed three balls of dough into each muffin cup. They turned into beautiful clover rolls. Nice touch. Also I use a pizza cutter to cut my dough.,

instructions, 1. 1. In a small bowl dissolve 1 teaspoon sugar and yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy about 10 minutes. Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles then remove from heat. Mix in 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup butter and salt; stir until melted. Let cool until lukewarm.
2. 2. In a large bowl combine the yeast mixture milk mixture eggs and 1 1/2 cup flour; stir well to combine. Stir in the remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic about 8 minutes.
3. 3. Lightly oil a large bowl place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume about 1 hour.
4. 4. While dough is rising melt 3/4 cup butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in 3/4 cup brown sugar whisking until smooth. Pour into greased 9x13 inch baking pan. Sprinkle bottom of pan with 1/2 cup pecans; set aside. Melt remaining butter; set aside. Combine remaining 3/4 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup pecans and cinnamon; set aside.
5. 5. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface roll into an 18x14 inch rectangle. Brush with 2 tablespoons melted butter leaving 1/2 inch border uncovered; sprinkle with brown sugar cinnamon mixture. Starting at long side tightly roll up pinching seam to seal. Brush with remaining 2 tablespoons butter. With serrated knife cut into 15 pieces; place cut side down in prepared pan. Cover and let rise for 1 hour or until doubled in volume. Meanwhile preheat oven to 375*F.(190*C.).
6. 6. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown. Let cool in pan for 3 minutes then invert onto serving platter. Scrape remaining filling from the pan onto the rolls.
7. My Update Note:  Here is how we rolled tight buns. Make sure you roll your dough out to 1/4". Apply butter evenly then sugar/cinnamon mixture. Holding the rolling pin gently roll over the sugar/cinnamon mixture. At the beginning of the roll only 1/2" of dough and pinch down. Now you must begin rolling from each corner middle working your way back and forth. Curve your corners toward the center to avoid too much overlap (exess) IMPT: after about 2-3 rolls carefully lift up each portion and pull away from you this will "tuck" in the dough be careful not to tear the dough. A lot to remember but after you get the hang of it it's like second nature and you will have picture perfect cinnamon rolls and sticky buns.
8. Here's a trick for cutting the rolls without mashing the dough: take a piece of thread slide it under the roll cross the thread and pull quickly. It works like magic and you don't have a sticky knife to clean up afterwards!
9. Just a tip: the longer you let them rise the fluffier and better they taste!
10. I didn't add the pecans to the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture that went inside the rolls. I would suggest not melting the butter that you spread on the inside before you roll it up. If you just spread on a thin layer of softened butter you should end up with a more ooey-gooey feel because you'll have more butter on the inside to melt which will make the caramel more gooey. When you use the melted butter you don't get a lot of butter on the inside & I found this tended to give me a dryer--but still good--caramel roll. I will try again but next time I won't melt my butter. Have made a couple more times & it definitely works better not to melt the butter for the inside and then I double the caramel for the bottom. But does need some adjustments.
11. I did used a 9 X 13 baking pan and I made a little extra filling. In addition I made some simple white icing and I have to say this is one of the best sticky buns I have ever had; and I've had quite a lot over the years. I never thought I'd make a world class sticky bun but I was wrong. I would highly suggest taking extra time and being extra careful when reading the directions. In addition I allowed my first rise to go for approximately 2 hours and it came out perfect. If you want great sticky buns that will knock the socks off your friends and family this is it! Happy Holidays.!,

instructions, 1. 1. In a small bowl mash blue cheese and buttermilk together with a fork until mixture resembles large-curd cottage cheese. Stir in sour cream mayonnaise vinegar sugar and garlic powder until well blended. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
2. 2. Mix grated blue cheese into the cream base a little at a time to ensure it is evenly incorporated and doesn't clump.
3. 3. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours (preferably overnight) to consolidate the flavors.
4. My Note:   Triple or quadruptle all ingredients except the blue cheese and then add cheese to taste. You will want to keep a supply on hand.
5. If you didn't have buttermilk you can just mixed the vinegar into the milk first and let it sit for about 15 minutes to thicken.
6. Quite good--the kids even liked it which surprized me! Next time I'd increase the garlic powder but that's purely personal preferance. I'll use this recipe again.,

Cook covered on high for about 4 minutes stir then another 3 mins (may need more or less depending on power of your microwave).  Drain water then mash with a dollop of butter or margarine.  Once as lump-free as possible add enough milk to make creamy but not so much that it's sloppy and stir briskly with a fork.

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat oven to 375*F. Grease 24 mini-muffin cups.
2. 2. Mix 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup margarine and nutmeg in a large bowl. Stir in the milk then mix in the baking powder and flour until just combined. Fill the prepared mini muffin cups about half full.
3. 3. Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are lightly golden 15 to 20 minutes.
4. 4. While muffins are baking place 1/4 cup of melted margarine in a bowl. In a separate bowl mix together 1/2 cup of sugar with the cinnamon. Remove muffins from their cups dip each muffin in the melted margarine and roll in the sugar-cinnamon mixture. Let cool and serve.
5. My Note:   I was curious about a couple of things about this recipe. First why did I end up with 24 not 12 of these mini muffins as the recipe indicates? Could it be that I  misprint? Mine is a standard mini-muffin tin. Second I really don't like nutmeg much. So WHY do I LOVE these muffins?! And why can't I stop popping them in my mouth? Don't kid yourself by thinking that because they're small you won't eat as much. You'll just eat more of them. And making them in the mini muffin tins was GENIUS Dianne! That way you get more of that buttery cinnamony sweetness in every bite! I did make a couple of modifications but nothing that would significantly alter the recipe. I used butter instead of margarine and because I have an entire quart of buttermilk to use I subbed buttermilk for the milk. This worked beautifully but please note that if you do that you MUST add 1/2 teaspoons baking soda and eliminate the baking powder to adjust the acidity and make them rise properly! Plus they're so darned pretty I could just eat them up! (And I already did with five of them) Your recipe is a beauty Dianne! ~A hopefully helpful update: because of my curiosity I did some shopping around to learn that the sizes of mini-muffin tins varies sometimes significantly! This explains the variance in yield with this recipe to anywhere from 12 to 24 of these little muffins. This recipe makes 24 mini muffins. You fill the muffins cups 1/2 full with batter and they should rise to just above top of the muffin tin. You can certainly also make 12 larger mini muffins if you wish but "officially" this recipe makes 24. I think 12 has worked for me because my muffin tin is on the bigger side. Sorry about the confusion!
6. I dare you to eat just one --  With that in mind the only thing I would do differently next time is to double or triple the recipe because these don't last long. I sprayed a little Pam for baking in the bottom of my mini-muffin cups so they'd pop right out. I can't wait to make these with my niece as this is definitely a kid friendly recipe.
7. I put in a little less than 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I also coated mine in powdered sugar vanilla glaze and a chocolate glaze. We all like the vanilla glaze best! Here is the recipe I used for my vanilla glaze 2 cups confectioners' sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 TBS milk 1 TBS butter softened Put that into a bowl and mix together. I added more milk but I didn't measure. I just got it to the consistancy I liked. Once I mixed it I poured have of the glaze into another bowl and added 1 TBS cocoa powder and mixed. Then I dipped the muffins in the glazes and let dry. I double dipped them. Then on the vanilla glaze ones I dipped some of the tops in the chocolate glaze. Also glaze them once they have cooled. If you don't wait they will fall apart.,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 200°C.
2. Boil the water add the leeks salt to taste and butter and continue boiling until the water has almost evaporated. Then turn heat down and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until the leeks are very tender. Then drain thoroughly.
3. While the leeks are simmering place the chopped onion and minced garlic in a microwave-safe dish with the 1/2 teaspoon of butter and microwave for probably about a minute (try 1/2 a minute first) or until the onion and garlic have just softened.
4. Beat the eggs the cream the ¼ cup of grated cheese the nutmeg and seasonings. Then add the leeks the onions and garlic and mix thoroughly so that they are well-combined.
5. With the olive oil spray lightly spray 2 mini muffin trays (24 cups) and cut out circles from the pastry sheets just slightly larger than the muffin tins.
6. Gently push the pastry rounds into each cup and spread the leek mixture evenly between the cups being careful not to over fill the cups. Then top each tart with a little grated tasty cheese and cook in the oven for about 12 to 15 minutes or until the tarts are golden.  As ovens vary so much it's a good idea to check them after 10 minutes.  And if you know your oven is inclined to burn things place a piece of kitchen loosely on top of the tarts for perhaps the first part of the cooking and perhaps only add the additional grated cheese when you remove the foil.
7. NOTE: If you want to freeze the tarts firstly put them in the freezer (cooled but as is) for 1-2 hours. Then remove them from the tins and transfer to an airtight container placing baking paper between each layer. To cook put them back into the muffin tins and cook from frozen.,

4. My Note:   What others have added mustard pickles bacon radishes etc. Because everyone’s tastes vary as mentioned in the description I encourage you to add "additional ingredients" to make this recipe "your own". Don’t be afraid to experiment that's what makes cooking fun. When adding bacon or chopped dill pickles you may want to reduce the salt called for in the recipe. To make this quickly - first start cooking the eggs - then take out the large bowl that you will be using to serve - I peel and dice the potatoes and rinsed them in that bowl to get out starch - put potatoes in cold water and bring to boil - then lower heat to a slow boil and cook approximately 10 to 15 minute Your eggs will probably be finised by then so cool them down with cold water. Then mix all the ingredients for dressing in the bowl - add the chopped eggs and by then your potatoes are probably ready to add. Very little clean up and no waiting time for things to be done - I added a tablespoon of ground mustard to dressing and only used 2 eggs but that is just a preference. I thought this turned out great and it was fast. The inlaws/outlaws? (in Sweden) are in love with this and have asked for the recipe! Have Fun and Happy Cooking!,

3. Cook the burgers in a non stick frying pan or under a hot grill  turning once until evenly cooked.
4. NB. Please be aware that the mixture is quite soft so you will need to handle carefully to prevent the burger from breaking up while cooking.,

instructions, 1. 1. Place 1 cup water bread flour sugar salt and yeast into bread machine pan in the order recommended by manufacturer. Select Dough cycle and press Start.
2. 2. When the cycle has completed place dough in a greased bowl turning to coat all sides. Cover and let rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Dough is ready if indentation remains when touched.
3. 3. Punch down dough. On a lightly floured surface roll into a 16x12 inch rectangle. Cut dough in half creating two 8x12 inch rectangles. Roll up each half of dough tightly beginning at 12 inch side pounding out any air bubbles as you go. Roll gently back and forth to taper end. Place 3 inches apart on a greased cookie sheet. Make deep diagonal slashes across loaves every 2 inches or make one lengthwise slash on each loaf. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 30 to 40 minutes or until doubled in bulk.
4. 4. Preheat oven to 375*F. Mix egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water; brush over tops of loaves.
5. 5. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven or until golden brown.
6. My Note:    I've learned over the years: Do NOT add the salt with the flour. Combine the flour with the yeast mixture and knead for 5-7 min (in mixer). Remove dough hook cover work bowl and let sit 15 minutes. THEN sprinkle salt evenly over the dough and knead again until the salt is well incorporated. Set aside in warm place (85°F) until doubled in size --  proceed with shaping dough as desired. For those who prefer a more crunchy crust use only egg white for brushing the loaf - and throw 1/4 cup of water onto the bottom of the oven (avoid heating element if you have an electric oven) - immediately place the loaf in the oven and bake as directed --  the water will create steam and gives the bread a crispier crust. When I prefer a soft crust I whisk a whole egg (not just the yolk). Also bread is typically ready when an instant read thermometer inserted into the bread registers 190-200*F. For bread sticks omit brushing the dough with egg. Delicious!
7. You definitely DO NOT need a bread machine for these. Simply combine the water yeast and sugar and allow to proof. Then add the salt then flour and knead until no longer sticky. Place in an oiled bowl and allow to rise according to recipe instructions. I rolled my dough out and made 2 baguettes. I really think I'll make 3 baguettes next time because I use mine for sandwiches and they were a little too big. After baking I cut the top off the whole length of the baguette so that the top looks like an upside down triangle (like they do at Subway). This leaves me with a bottom piece that is concave in the middle. I then put 2 pieces of provolone cheese and then top it with Chicken Salad. I put the filled bottom piece in the oven by itself for about 7 minutes. Then I put mayo on the top piece and place it in the oven with the bottom piece and I let it heat for about another 5 minutes or so. It's GREAT! The bread is slightly crusty on the outside moist and soft on the inside -- a far cry from those chewy store-bought baguettes. For me: This one's a keeper for sure. Oh and they freeze well too.,

5. Eat immediately or freeze in a container then churn once more on Speed 8 just before serving. I have tried putting the mixture back in the freezer after the second churn to keep it for a longer period without needing to process it again before eating and that seems to work pretty well.,

14. Starting at the outside edge of the cake tin arrange the banana slices overlapping each other in a circle on top of the sauce.
15. Now arrange another circle of banana slices inside the first and so on until you reach the middle of the tin.
16. Reserve four smaller slices for the centre and arrange them overlapping as best you can.
17. Now carefully spoon the cake batter as evenly as possible into the tin being sure not to disturb the bananas.
18. Take a bread knife and gently smooth the batter until it is spread evenly.
19. Place the cake onto the centre shelf of a preheated 180C (170C fan-forced) oven and bake for 45-50 minutes (approximately 40 minutes in a fan-forced oven).
20. The cake is cooked when it looks golden brown and the springs back when you touch it - if unsure insert a skewer into the cake and if it comes out clean the cake is cooked.
21. Remove the cake from the oven and let it sit for 3 minutes before running a knife around the rim to loosen the sides.
22. Now place a large plate upside down over the top of the cake tin and being careful not to burn yourself quickly invert the plate and the tin.
23. Leave the cake tin to stand on top of the plate for 20 seconds before removing it.
24. If any bananas stick to the top of the tin simply remove them and press back into the cake.
25. Serve warm drizzled with extra golden syrup and serve with thick cream or ice-cream.
26. If you have to make the cake in advance it can be reheated for a couple of minutes in the microwave.
27. If you wish to be really decadent and serve this cake as a dessert consider making up a batch of the Caramel Sauce that goes with my Little Icky Sticky Puddings recipe #88565 to serve with it.,

instructions, 1. Pop popcorn and remove any unpopped kernals. Set aside. You should have approx 20 cups of popped popcorn.
2. Place two or three baking trays or cookie trays on your bench top. You'll spread the hot caramel coated popcorn onto these later.
3. Use the largest saucepan/stockpot or boiler that you can find. Add the butter brown sugar and syrup.
4. Over heat bring to the boil and boil for approx 4-5 minutes. Stir fairly constantly with a wooden spoon. Remove from heat. Add the bicarb soda and the vanilla essence. Stir well.
5. Add half of the popcorn and quickly stir to coat in the hot caramel mix. Add remaining popcorn and nuts(if you have chosen to add them as an optional extra). Stir thoroughly to cover the popcorn evenly. Work quickly.
6. Spread the popcorn over your baking dishes or cookie trays. Break up clumps of popcorn with your wooden spoon.
7. After about a minute the popcorn should be cool enough to handle carefully. Break up the popcorn to smaller sized pieces.
8. As a variation you can roll popcorn into balls the size of a scoop of ice-cream and push them into ice-cream cones. Great for childrens parties. (The flat based cones work best for this- much easier to place on your bench to cool).
9. Cool and store in an airtight container. Will keep for about a week (if it lasts that long without being gobbled up!).
10. UPDATE: I made these on a wet and very humid day and the popcorn was 'sticky'. I haven't had this problem before and have made this popcorn recipe a dozen times. Placed in a baking dish and heated at 120°C for about 20 minutes. Stirring every 5 minutes or so. Really took away the stickiness and made the popcorn crunchy.,

instructions, 1. 1. Mince 3 cloves of garlic and combine in a small bowl with mayonnaise anchovies 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese Worcestershire sauce mustard and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Refrigerate until ready to use.
2. 2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cut the remaining 3 cloves of garlic into quarters and add to hot oil. Cook and stir until brown and then remove garlic from pan. Add bread cubes to the hot oil. Cook turning frequently until lightly browned. Remove bread cubes from oil and season with salt and pepper.
3. 3. Place lettuce in a large bowl. Toss with dressing remaining Parmesan cheese and seasoned bread cubes.
4. My Note:  I scaled this down to 2 servings and so as not to waste the better part of a can of anchovies used a little dab of anchovy paste instead. Outside of the dressing being a little thicker than I liked which I simply thinned with a little half and half it was just wonderfully creamy flavorful and a fine substitute for the "real" thing. I however followed it to a T - right down to the real anchovies and not anchovy paste. IT WAS EXCELLENT. I've been using an "authentic" caeser recipe for awhile and this is much much better (and easier to make). This is in my list of keepers and will replace any caeser dressing I make in the future. UPDATE: I put everything in a blender after chopping the garlic and anchovies. I've made it a second (and now a third) time and a small food processor actually works better than the blender. The ingredients were a little thick and wouldn't blend so I added a very little bit of milk on the suggestion of my D/W and a little bit of red wine vinegar. Additionally I added a couple drops of tabasco. After that everything blended perfectly. I also used some grated parmesan in the dressing and then added some shredded parmesan after I mixed it with the lettuce. Finally I also added some extra lemon juice at the end- over the top of the salad. I found that the dressing is better after it sits for a while (!) so the flavors can meld (before you add the lettuce) as is usually the case with homemade salad dressings. This was fairly garlicky but I love garlic and usually add extra to recipes - I didn't add any extra garlic and I really liked this- perfect for me but would be okay with more garlic as well. Finally I definitely would keep in the anchovies- If you chop them fine (and I even chopped them before I put them in the blender) you don't even know they're there it's not fishy but it does add to the caesar dressing. Also I found that all of the oil was needed in the blender for it to blend but in the future I will add the other ingredients (milk red wine vinegar) to get it to blend and then slowly dri. A sliced roma tomato fanned on the edge of each plate is our favorite addition for both color and taste but this is such an amazingly good recipe that the possibilities are endless. Grilled shrimp? Crab? Avocado? D/W you are a certified Caesar genius.,

2. Cut each of the slices of bacon into halves lengthwise. Plait these strips around the pork in a criss-cross pattern. Reserve the marinade for heating and serving with the pork.
3. Cook the bacon wrapped pork fillet on a heated barbecue on a medium heat for approximately 30 minutes or until the pork is cooked through turning halfway through cooking.
4. Place the remaining marinade into a small saucepan and bring to the boil.  Lower the heat add 1/4 cup of wine and simmer for an extra minute and serve with the sliced pork as a sauce.
5. Notes: The original recipe specified Leggo's Stir Through Sauce - Roasted Tomato & Bacon but Zaar was unable to recognise this as an ingredient.  The closest acceptable ingredient I could find was roasted garlic alfredo sauce.  Use whatever equivalent to one of these is available in your region.  The pork can be cooked in a conventional oven at 180ºC for 40 minutes or in an outdoor kettle oven following manufacturer's weight for cooking time.,

instructions, 1. Meatball:
2. 1. Preheat the oven to 425*F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat it with a thin layer of olive oil.
3. 2. Measure out 1/2 the beaten egg and discard it or reserve for another use. In a medium bowl whisk the ricotta and the remaining egg together until combined.
4. 3. Put the remaining meatball ingredients in a medium bowl. Mix with your hands or if you prefer a wooden spoon. Be careful not to overmix or the meatballs will be tough. Add the egg mixture and stir to combine.
5. 4. Using about 1 teaspoon of the mixture at a time form the balls in your hand (you may need to put a little olive oil on your hands to keep the mixture from sticking too much). You want the meatballs to be just ½-inch in diameter. Place them on the prepared baking sheet.
6. 5. Cook the meatballs in the oven for 10-12 minutes stirring once or twice until they are well browned but not hard. Remove from the oven and set aside. Turn the oven down to 375*F.
7. Mac and Cheese:
8. 1. Butter an 8-inch square (1½-quart) baking dish or pan (or six 8-ounce ramekins). Set aside.
9. 2. Fill a 4- to 5-quart pot about 3/4 full with water and add 1 tablespoon of the salt. Bring to a boil and add the pasta. Cook stirring once or twice until tender but firm 6-8 minutes and drain.
10. 3. Using the same pot you used to cook the pasta melt the butter over medium heat. Slowly whisk in the flour and stir constantly until a paste forms 30-45 seconds. Continue stirring for 1-2 minutes more until the mixture starts to darken slightly and smell a bit nutty. Slowly whisk in the cream milk and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and cook until the mixture starts to thicken and is just beginning to bubble around the edges 5-7 minutes. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Add the Taleggio mozzarella and cayenne. Stir until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth but not too runny. It should be similar in texture to cake batter. If it’s soupy continue cooking until it thickens. Add the pasta and meatballs and stir to combine.
11. 4. To assemble spread about 1 cup of the tomato sauce in the bottom of the pan. Pour the pasta mixture into the pan. Pour the remaining tomato sauce on top of the pasta and top with the burrata. Place the dish on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until bubbling and golden brown about 30 minutes. Let cool for 20 minutes before serving.
12. *The burrata may fall apart when cutting but don't worry about it.,

instructions, 1. Line 2 mini muffin pans with paper cups.
2. Take one Mars Bar and slice it into thin wafers and then cut those in half so you have tiny squares of Mars Bars. (Refrigerating the bar may help it from becoming too mushy when you slice it).
3. In a large saucepan over a low heat melt the butter and remaining 4 of the Mars Bars until it is a runny caramel.
4. Do NOT overcook as the butter and Mars Bars will become a toffee if you leave it to heat too long. The minute it has no lumps and is runny take it off the heat.
5. Immediately add the Coco Pops and stir until combined.
6. Put one teaspoon full of mixture into each paper cup and press down firmly so that it takes the shape of the cupcake. Put the filled muffin pan in the fridge while you do the other one.
7. By the time you finish the second pan the first will have set so tip out the muffins onto a large tray and put more paper cups into the pan.
8. Continue in this way until all of the mixture has been done.
9. Melt the chocolate and place about a teaspoon full over the top of each muffin and smooth it gently.
10. Finally add a square of sliced Mars Bar to decorate.
11. Edited to add: I made this recently with jumbo sized cereal balls which I had chopped roughly with a knife as I couldn't find Coco-Pops and it was very nice. (Some even preferred the Nesquick chocolate cereal ball version.) I also made these as normal muffins and they were just as wonderful in a larger version.,

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat oven to 425*F.
2. 2. In a large bowl whisk together the flour baking powder salt and sugar. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Gradually stir in milk until dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.
3. 3. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead 15 to 20 times. Pat or roll dough out to 1 inch thick. Cut biscuits with a large cutter or juice glass dipped in flour. Repeat until all dough is used. Brush off the excess flour and place biscuits onto an ungreased baking sheet.
4. 4. Bake for 13 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven or until edges begin to brown.
5. My Note:  I do not substitute shortning for the butter or margarine better flavor. For those who didn't get the desired results -- Try these tips: The instructions say to knead 14-15 TIMES NOT 14-15 minutes! The object is to handle the dough as little as possible. 1.Don't overmix the dough once you add the milk and only pat together (no real "kneading" or they will be tough). 2.only add the amount of milk you need some days i have to use it all and then others I have a little left in the cup. 3. make sure the butter is cold 4.can brush with melted butter before and/or after baking for added softness and flavor and 5. can place closer together if yours still aren't soft. If you're new to biscuits remember - any time you make biscuits (or scones or anything else that uses baking powder or soda to rise) you want to gently mix the dough JUST until the ingredients are all mixed-- don't maul it or knead it. The more you handle your dough the more the gluten develops and the tougher your biscuits (or pie crust etc.) will be.
6. The only drawback was that they were bland and definitely had a slight baking powder taste. I made them a second time and substituted cultured buttermilk powder (4 TBS Saco brand) + 1 Celsius water in place of the milk; dropped the baking powder back to 2 tsp; and added 1/2 tsp baking soda. Oh my goodness -- perfection -- so flavorful and soft and fluffy! Absolutely the best I've ever made or eaten - Hope these tip's help and thank you so much doing.
7. I do know that the barometer affects how your biscuits turn out (works the same with anything with yeast such as bread) so if it's raining or very humid they won't rise as well. If it's hot and dry they should rise beautifully. So I kind of go by that when I am adding the liquid and flour (amounts). After you've made enough biscuits you can tell how their going to turn out by how the (uncooked) dough looks and feels. I was thinking about the post that said they turned out dry on the outside and moist inside if they seem very hard then I would think possibly they were cooked at too high a temperature and/or were left in too long. Because my oven is very hot I always turn it down by 25 degrees and never assume that the time stated is going to be "perfect" for my oven so I checked these after 10 minutes and then watched them 2 to 3 minutes after. Anyway you should enjoy these.,

instructions, 1. Prepare cake batter according to package directions adding lemon extract. Pour into a greased and floured 9-in. round baking pan.
2. Bake at 350*F. for 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
3. In a bowl whisk milk and pudding mix for 2 minutes; refrigerate. Ina heavy saucepan or microwave; melt chocolate and butter stir until smooth. Stir in confectioners' sugar until crumbly. Stir in hot water 1 teaspoon at a time until smooth. Split cake into two horizontal layers. Spread pudding on bottom layer. Place second layer over pudding. Pour chocolate glaze over top letting it drizzle down the sides. Store in the refrigerator.
4. My Notes:  Some time I didn't have a box mix so I made a yellow cake from scratch! It was wonderful! Using one cup of milk in pudding is CRUICIAL! As is letting the pudding and cake cool completely. The pudding turns stiff kinda like Mousse or Flan. That makes it PERFECT for spreading between layers.
5. I used less milk in the pudding (1cup) might try 1&1/2c. next time. Chilled the pudding first and the cakes before putting together. I also sliced the rounded top off the bottom cake so pudding would sit nicely. French vanilla instant pudding gives it the custard effect. Extremely easy.
6. I used French Vanilla cake mix and pudding because that's what I had. I also used only 1Cup milk - I think I could have used 1 1/4 and had a little more pudding but it worked out fine. The key is to make sure EVERYTHING is cool. I put the cake and pudding in the fridge before assembling. With the cake cold the icing cooled quickly and set easily on the cake instead of just drizzling off the cake and onto the pan.,

3. Lightly oil the base.
4. Spoon on lemon grass dill and parsley into the center of each sheet.
5. Score the skin of each fillet and lay skin side down onto herbs.
6. Season flesh side with salt and pepper.
7. Bring up sides of foil and fold down until its tight but still enough room for fillet to breath. Bring in other sides.
8. On a baking tray place parcels and put into the oven. Shouldn't take any more then 10 minutes to cook fish through but you may want to check to make sure fish has flaked.
9. In the meantime cut cherry tomatoes into quarters and cut the capsicum/pepper into small thin strips. Toss together with baby spinach herbs and the red wine vinegar.
10. When salmon is ready I suggest serving it in a bag so the eater can open it up and be hit with the aroma. If not fish people plate the fillet with a side of the small salad. Salmon also goes devine with some diced cantaloupe papaya and kiwi fruit.,

instructions, 1. 1. Place the chicken butter soup and onion in a slow cooker and fill with enough water to cover.
2. 2. Cover and cook for 5 to 6 hours on High. About 30 minutes before serving place the torn biscuit dough in the slow cooker. Cook until the dough is no longer raw in the center.
3. My Update Note:   It better than grandma's homemade chicken and dumplings and the gourmet chef who lives next door tasted it and thought it was an old family recipe. :) And loved it! First you definitly need to add spices. I used cumin parsley poultry seasoning seasoned salt and pepper. Next I only used 1 can of biscuits not 2. (I even used the reduced fat version and they tasted the same!) Thirdly I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken. Instead of water I used 3/4 can of low sodium/lowfat chicken broth. At first it seemed like way to much liquid but eventually the biscuits soaked it all up! Fourthly I added 2 CANS of mixed veggies (mix of carrots peas tiny potatoes celery). I am not a fan of canned veggies by any means but they tasted great in this recipe- so tender! I did add red onion but I used only half and chopped the pieces extra small. Lastly I cooked the biscuits for almost 3 hours for a total cooking time of 6.5 hours on high. 30 minutes is just not enough time! Another tip- if you accidentally add too much chicken broth add a bit of sifted flour and the sauce thickens right up! I know that this recipe will be a winter tradition in our household for years to come!
4. Some other adjustments I do sometime are as follows: Use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup (as directed- don't deviate with other cream soups) cover with 1 14 oz can of chicken broth (no need to cover with water dillutes flavor). Put torn biscuit dough in roughly 90 minutes before ready to serve and make sure that you push them down into the liquid mixture a little so that they get cooked on the tops too and saturated with the chicken flavor. I made this recipe with veggies and without it was better WITHOUT because the consistency was better and the veggie flavor soaked into the dumplings. 5 hours on High is MORE than enough total cooking time. Also leave chicken partially frozen when starting out and don't tear meat until right before adding dumplings this keeps chicken moist. THIS ONE'S IS A WINNER TOO! Now you have three way to do it.,

source, , 
instructions, 1. 1. Preheat oven to 400*F. Spray or lightly grease a 9 inch round cake pan.
2. 2. In a large bowl combine flour cornmeal sugar salt and baking powder. Stir in egg milk and vegetable oil until well combined. Pour batter into prepared pan.
3. 3. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.
4. My Note:    I use 1/3 Celsius white and 1/3 Celsius brown sugar and I let the cornmeal soak in the milk for 10-15 minutes before mixing with the other ingredients. I've also replaced the vegetable oil with melted butter which works very well.
5. This works as cornbread muffins too! I am not a huge fan of making cornbread as a round or square cake shape… they just are too messy that way. Instead I like to pour the batter into muffin tins lined with cupcake/muffin papers. This recipe works great as muffins. I pour the batter almost to the very top of the paper liners then I bake this at 375 degrees but I have a convection oven so the heat is usually 25*F. less than the normal temperature… so you can cook it at the suggested heat of 400*F. with a normal oven. It takes 20-23 minutes for a toothpick to come out clean. The tops are always nicely browned and the muffins are perfectly cooked. The only other minor change I make is I use a medium grind cornmeal that is a little more course. It makes the cornbread more like a true “comfort food”. If you don’t like that extra crunch then use a finer grind. EVERYONE loves this-.
6. Additional options: I can bake it in a muffin pan (bake only 15 minutes); I can cut back on my sugar to maybe a round 1/2-cup (or less). I can add just a smidgen more salt. I can add a 1/2 t. vanilla. Add I can also add just a little bit more oil (so it's not quite so crumbly). The next time I bake this for our gang I'm going to add all of the above.
7. I did cut down on the sugar a little. (It's still sweet) Delicious with butter and honey on it. Fantastic accompaniment to soup or stew or beans or even makes a great breakfast!,

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat oven to 350*F. Grease and flour three 7x3 inch loaf pans.
2. 2. In a large bowl mix together pumpkin puree eggs oil water and sugar until well blended. In a separate bowl whisk together the flour baking soda salt cinnamon nutmeg cloves and ginger. Stir the dry ingredients into the pumpkin mixture until just blended. Pour into the prepared pans.
3. 3. Bake for about 50 minutes in the preheated oven. Loaves are done when toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
4. My Note:   Did two Baked them at 65 minutes and used the toothpick test. The first loaf was gone in less than a day! Froze the other loaf for future use.
5. This has been the only time I could play with my food today! I grabbed everyone's hints and here's what I did: 1/2 cup butter; 1/4 cup oil; 1/4 Celsius applesauce and 1 Celsius brown sugar with 2 cups of white sugar. Then while it was hot I poked holes in the bread (cooked in a tube pan) and drizzled the cinnamon sugar and butter combo over the holes. This is dangerous! It is so yummy I froze sections of it right away so I wouldn't overdue the eating part.
6. I ended up making a dozen Pumpkin muffins and a Pumpkin loaf as well. It is simply scrumptious! Below is how I ended up re-writing the recipe - it turned out moist spicy and DELICIOUS! My family has already asked me to make this at Christmas! 15 Oz Can Pumpkin; 4 Eggs; 1/2 Cup Veg. Oil; 1/2 Cup Applesauce (I used sweetened); 2 Cups Sugar; 3 1/2 Cups Flour; 2 teaspoons Baking Soda; 1 1/2 Tsp Salt; 1 teaspoons Cinnamon; Splash of Vanilla; 1/4 Tsp Pumpkin Spice; 1 Cup Walnuts; 1/2 Cup Raisins; 1 Tsp Nutmeg; 1/2 Tsp Cloves; 1/4 Tsp Ground Ginger; Blended and cooked as described in original recipe. Both placed in the oven at the same time the Muffins were done in 40 minutes and Bread was done in 1 hr 10 minutes. While on Cooling rack poked holes in top of muffins and bread and poured seperate hot Cinnamon Sugar Butter combo over holes allowing it to seep down inside.
7. I also used one cup of packed light brown sugar and two cups of regular sugar. I baked mine in one pyrex loaf pan(only one I have) and also made 12 muffins. The one cup of oil was not a problem for me at all nothing came out greasy. I also sift all my dry ingredients together(not sugar). I will be making this again for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Update: 12/06- This was so yummy my kids actually asked for more the other day. This also freezes really well. I froze most of the 12 muffins I made and when defrosted they were still really good. 11/08- Yes I am still making this recipe today in fact! We now like to add chocolate chips. About 1 cup does the trick as we don't like many just enough to give it a chocolate taste. Tip: Freeze the chocolate chips before hand if you want them to retain some of their shape when done cooking.,

TAKE CARE NOT TO OVERHEAT the custard mixture or it may curdle.
4. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and cover the surface closely with plastic wrap right on the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Allow the custard to cool then chill in the refrigerator.
5. Whisk the cream in a large bowl until it holds soft peaks.

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 450*F.
2. Mix flour salt paprika sage and pepper together in a bag. Add chicken parts in a bag and shake until well coated.
3. Melt butter/margarine in a 9x13 inch baking dish in the preheated oven. Place chicken in the baking dish skin side down and bake for 20 minutes. Turn pieces and bake another 20 minutes until tender and juices run clear.
4. My Note:   I used skinless boneless chicken breasts because some of my family isn't fond of bone-in chicken. GOOD LUCK with that one kid! This was very good and very easy to adapt to your own tastes by adding whatever spices you like. Next time I will add a dash of cayenne pepper. Will I did have some boneless chicken breasts ? so I cut the cooking time by half and also used half the butter. I doubled the spices but not the flour as well per all the other kids request it. Chicken was juicy and very good. All the kids raved about it! Quick and easy. Will make again!
5. I've cooked chicken a million different ways. (Slight exageration maybe.) But this is the best "fried" chicken ever! I'll never go back to the pan fried again. I cooked it per the recipe except I doubled the recipe and used a package of six leg quarters. I separated the legs and thighs and had to use two pans. (Quite reasonable at $.69/lb.) The coating was as if it was fried and had a beautiful golden/brownish color. My octogenarian family raved about it as soon as it hit the table. My wife made excellent gravy.The kid's are good with gravy only out of a jar. The flavor was great! This is now my new staple.
6. I used bone in breasts and I tried 1 with the skin on and 1 with the skin off. I liked the one without skin better as it allowed the seasonings to really penetrate the meat. The meat stayed so moist. I doubled all the spices didnt use sage and added a touch of cayenne pepper. I also added onion powder and garlic powder.,

2. Anything between a moderate and high heat will be fine for these potatoes.
3. Grease a baking tin or tray.
4. Wash potatoes well but do not peel.
5. Cut a thin slice from the base of each potato so that they will sit flat on a cutting board.
6. Place a potato on the cutting board and lay a wooden spoon alongside the length of it.
7. This stops you from cutting right through to the bottom of the potato.
8. Now using a sharp knife held at right angles to the wooden spoon thinly slice the potato but DO NOT CUT ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM.
9. (Think of the way garlic bread is sliced- that's the effect you're looking for.) Repeat until all potatoes are sliced in this way.
10. Place potatoes into the baking tin.
11. Now using a pastry brush brush butter or margarine over the top of each potato and use the brush (and your fingers) to carefully push some of the butter down between the slices.
12. Reserve some butter or margarine to baste during cooking.
13. Bake for around 45 minutes at 180°-220°C (350°- 425°F) before adding spice mixture.
14. While the potatoes are cooking combine the ingredients for the spice topping in a small bowl and mix well.
15. After 45 minutes brush the reserved melted butter or margarine over the potatoes then sprinkle the potatoes with the spice mixture.
16. Return potatoes to the oven and bake for a further 15 minutes or until brown and crispy.
17. (If the potatoes are not browning nicely after the first 45 minutes simply increase the heat for the last 15- 20 minutes of cooking. If you are cooking a roast you can time it so that you remove the meat to rest for 15-20 minutes before the potatoes are done).,

2. 2. In medium saucepan melt butter and stir in flour to make a roux. Cook 1 to 2 minutes stirring constantly then whisk in warm milk a little at a time to make a white sauce. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer. Mix in salt pepper and cayenne and stir frequently until sauce thickens.

4. My Note: UPDATE:9/2002-  I LOVE this recipe! I remember making mac n cheese from scratch when I was a lot younger and was looking for a recipe that would give me that great taste. This is it! I left out the ham used 12 oz macaroni since there is a lot of sauce and added a teaspoon each of ground mustard and worcestershire sauce for extra flavor. I also added some melted butter to bread crumbs and crumbled over the top for a nice crispiness. It was sooo GOOD!,

instructions, 1. Heat oven to 350*F. Line 16 cups of two 12-cup mini-muffin pans with mini-muffin papers.
2. In a bowl combine flours and baking soda. In another bowl cream together sugar and butter with an electric mixer on medium. Add egg white sweet potato and vanilla; beat on low until well combined.
3. Add flour mixture and milk; beat on low until just combined. Do not overmix. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full.
4. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean 15 to 18 minutes. * see my note below.
5. Cool 10 minutes in pans; remove from pans and cool completely.
6. In a third bowl beat confectioners' sugar cream cheese and spices until smooth. Frost cupcakes; garnish with cranberries.
7. My Notes:  My grantgrandkids will eat them unfrosted but they are good enough to serve with frosting to the grown ups. I made my own oat flour with a food processor. I plan to make a second batch to throw in the freezer.
8. * I used 1/2 whole wheat 1/2 white flour. I would test the mini-muffin tin times yourself. I found 15:00 was too long and overcooked them. Probably start testing at 11-12 minutes for doneness.,

2. If using baby potatoes wash and dry them and then cut into quarters. If using larger potatoes cut into rouughly 1 inch pieces.
3. I like to place the potatoes into a large plastic bag or you can add them to a large mixing bowl. The plastic bag is the easiest and least messy option.
4. Add in the remaining ingredients and ensure thoroughly mixed.
5. Pour the potatoes out onto a flat tray in a single layer. I like to use cookies sheets. You dont need to grease the trays as the potatoes are already coated.
6. Place in the oven and turn after 20 minutes. Cook until done to your liking. Mine usually take 40 to 50 minutes.,

2. Remove from heat and allow to cool for 15 minutes at room temperature.
3. Meanwhile cut the kangaroo meat into bite size cubes for the kebabs try to keep them fairly square.
4. Once the sauce mixture has cooled gently stir through the kangaroo cubes into the saucepan and refrigerate for an hour. Turn ocasionally to make sure they are evenly coated.
5. Thread cubes onto the skewers but leave a gap between each piece of meat for more even cooking. Leave as much of the sauce on as possible it will help stew the meat a little and give good heat transfer with the BBQ plate.
6. Cook on a low-medium BBQ plate for around 2 minutes per side. I like to turn 90 degrees at a time so that is about 8 minutes total cooking time. Sometimes a piece will fail to rotate so have a fork on hand to give the bothersome pieces a little tweak.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees C ^ or 400 degrees F and line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. Mix together flour salt baking powder and bicarb soda in a bowl then set aside.
3. In another bowl combine the oil brown sugar citrus zest/lemon juice and egg; stir in the vanilla extract and buttermilk.
4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix till combined but do NOT overmix.
5. Gently add the fruit and mix.
6. Leave to sit for about 5 minutes and check the batter consistency - if it is still quite watery then add a little more flour as the batter should be quite stiff and hold it’s shape.  And if you used lemon juice instead of zest it will have more liquid.
7. Spoon the batter into the muffin cups and fill pretty much to the top. Don’t do anything silly like smooth the tops over as muffins look tastier when their tops are messily puffed!
8. Sprinkle whichever streusel topping (see Step 13 OR Step 14) you’re using evenly on top of each muffin and make sure they are well covered as when they cook they expand a lot and suddenly there isn’t as much streusel as you thought there was!
9. Bake for 15 minutes then lower temperature to 160 degrees C^ and bake for another 10 minutes. (When the muffins are done they will spring back when lightly touched.).
10. Let the muffins cool in the tray for 10 minutes then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
11. Enjoy! (especially if you have a nice cup of tea or hot chocolate!).
12. You can use either of these streusel toppings the walnut one is the original for this recipe but if you find yourself without any walnuts you might give the other one a try :).
13. For the Nut Streusel Topping:  Combine1 tablespoon unsalted butter  chilled 1/3 cup brown sugar (firmly packed) 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 cup walnuts finely chopped (you may sub pecans) in a bowl till you have a crumbly mixture.  Set aside if using immediately or store in the fridge till you want to use it.
14. OR for the Butter Streusel Topping:  Combine  60g caster sugar 90g all-purpose flour 1/2 scant teaspoon of baking powder 1/4 scant teaspoon of bicarb soda 80g chilled butter cut into cubes--mixing with your fingertips till it resembles coarse breadcrumbs and has a sandy texture.  Use a fork to combine 1 tablespoon demerara sugar (coffee sugar will suffice if you don't have any demerara) with the dough then set aside or store in the fridge till you need it if not using immediately.,

instructions, 1. To prepare trays; cover two large flat oven trays with aluminium foil; on first tray mark two circles one 15cm (6") one 10cm (4") in diameter.
2. On the second tray mark three circles 12cm (5") 8cm (3") and 5cm (2") in diameter; saucers cups jars and lids of the right sizes can be used as guides for circles.
3. The meringues are made in two batches each using half of the above ingredients; when ready to make second batch of meringues cover trays with fresh aluminium foil or baking paper.
4. Beat 4 egg whites until soft peaks form; gradually beat in 1 1/4 cups of sugar 1 tablespoon at a time; make sure each spoonful of sugar is dissolved by beating before adding the next spoonful this ensures crisp meringues - if you want pink layers in cake beat in enough food colouring to tint meringue light pink otherwise leave meringue layers white.
5. Spread meringue over circles marked on foil on the two prepared trays so they are approximately 2 cm (3/4”) thick; smooth tops of circles with spatula bake both trays in very slow oven 110 deg C (225 deg F) 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours; reverse oven position of slide after 30 minutes cooking time to allow for even cooking; when meringue feels dry to touch remove from oven and carefully slide foil with meringue circles on top on to cake cooler; of if time permits let meringues cool in oven with door ajar then slide foil with meringue circles on to cake cooler.
6. Prepare slides as directed above for remaining meringue; mark 18cm (7") circle on one tray; prepare second batch of meringue with remaining 4 egg whites and 1 1/4 cups of sugar using no colouring; spread meringue over 18cm (7") circle; mixture should be only about 1 cm (1/2”) thick then pipe 14 individual meringues approximately 4 cm (1 ½”) in diameter on to foil.
7. Pipe small individual meringues approximately 2.5cm (1”) in diameter on second foil covered tray; you will need approximately 50 small meringues which will all fit on to one tray; put tray with large circle and large meringues on shelf in centre of oven put tray with small individual meringues on oven shelf beneath; bake in a very slow oven 110 deg C (225 deg F); after 30 to 45 minutes take lower tray with small meringues from oven and set aside to cool; move remaining tray one shelf down in the oven where the small meringues were before.
8. After 45 minutes to 1 hour remove large individual meringues from top tray on to cake cooler; return large meringue circle to oven for a further 30 minutes cooking time or until it is dry to touch.
9. Wash hull and slice strawberries leaving at least 12 whole for decoration; spread out on paper towels to dry whip cream to firm piping consistency ( I find that if I test as it gets close to right consistency by tipping upside down – cream will stay in bowl if firm enough for piping but keep testing so it doesn’t curdle if whipped too much) then spoon into large piping bag fitted with star tube; put 18cm (7”) meringue circle on serving plate spread top lightly with whipped cream top with sliced strawberries then 15cm (6”) circle; continue with remaining meringue circles in order of size and layers of cream and sliced strawberries – don’t put strawberries to close to edge.
10. Pipe circle of cream around bottom layer gently press 4cm (1 ½”) diameter individual meringues into circle of cream; pipe another layer of cream above press circle of small meringues in place; continue in this way until all small meringues are used; pipe small stars of cream in between assembled meringues and decorate with whole strawberries between only some of the meringues.,

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat oven to 350*F. Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan or a 10 inch Bundt cake pan.
2. 2. In a medium bowl stir together the cake mix vanilla pudding mix and butterscotch pudding mix. Add the eggs oil and water mix until well blended. In another bowl stir together the brown sugar cinnamon and nuts. Pour half of the batter into the pan spread evenly. Sprinkle with half of the nut mixture. Cover with the rest of the batter and sprinkle with the rest of the nut mixture.
3. 3. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven then turn the oven down to 325*F. and bake for an additional 35 to 40 minutes.
4. My Note:   The cake batter takes only five or ten minutes to whip up and seems pretty forgiving. Though the recipe calls for one vanilla pudding mix and one butterscotch pudding mix I've never used the butterscotch (since I never have any in the cupboard!). Instead I've used two vanilla mixes or one vanilla and one chocolate mix. Either way the cake has always turned out great. Also for a little extra flavor dimension I've added a couple tablespoons of espresso or instant coffee to the water. The addition of coffee gives the cake a nice subtle bite--and makes it into a true 'coffee cake.' Overall this is a moist yummy recipe that my family members always ask for. And because it's so easy to make this would be a great cake for beginning bakers.
5. For optional icing/toping I put 1/2C powdered sugar and 1T of milk in a ziplock bag cut off corner and pour over. Looks real pretty and it's only enough to zig zag over. DEFINITELY take the advice of using Duncan Hines cake mix (white or yellow) or one that doesn't already have pudding in it. My oven is fast and I still had to bake for 45 min at 325*F. so definitely check with toothpick! Also you can use 2 pkgs of vanilla INSTANT pudding or 1 of cream cheese if you don't have butterstotch. I think putting 1/3 off batter 1/3 off brown sugar mix 1/3 batter 1/3 brown sugar mix then last of batter last of brown sugar mix is the best. It VISUALLY looks prettier when you cut it (again see pic) and it also isn't too overwhelming. Plus any more layers then you don't get to taste the brown sugar mix and that's the best part right? I never put nuts b/c the kids don't like it but if I did  -- I'd use pecans.
6. To made this recipe LOW-FAT and it was INCREDIBLE! Seriously it is the best coffee cake and SO moist! Instead of oil I use half a cup of apple sauce and half a cup of apple butter. I sware you'll never know it's low-fat. I made it in a bundt pan and layered it as follows: 1. batter 2. cinnamon mixture 3. semi-sweet chocolate chips 4. batter 5. cinnamon mixture 6. semi-sweet chocolate chips 7. batter 8. cinnamon mixture. I promise you will not be disappointed!
7. Since this cake adds 2 pkgs of pudding use a cake mix that does not already have pudding in the mix. Duncan Hines is the only one I know of that doesn't have pudding added.
8. I substituted a box of instant cheesecake pudding for the butterscotch pudding and 3/4 Cup of apple butter for the oil. I also skip the nuts as some of us can't have them.,

instructions, 1. Dice the chorizo with a knife or process briefly in a food processor. It doesn't have to be especially finely diced so a sharp knife will save some cleanup.
2. Mix chorizo garlic ginger onion and soy sauce well in a small bowl.
3. Put around a teaspoon of mixture into the middle of each wonton. Exact amount of mixture will depend a bit on the size of the wrappers.
4. Brush around the edge of each wonton wrapper as making with a little water and wrap into packages. There is probably a proper way to do this but I find the easiest is to fold left and right inwards top and bottom inwards so it ends up square and then gently squeeze in the palm of my hand to form a rounder shape.
5. They stick very easily so place baking paper into a steamer and prepare the steamer as per usual until steaming well.
6. Steam for approximately 10 minutes. Because of the chorizo you really only need to warm through and not cook as long as you would with raw meat.
7. Serve with sweet & sour sauce sweet chilli soy sauce or whatever else takes your fancy for dipping.,

3. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes turning once.
4. In a slow cooker or large saucepan over low heat blend the cranberry sauce chili sauce brown sugar and lemon juice. Add meatballs and simmer for 1 hour before serving.
5. My Update Note:   I have been making these meatballs for 30 years or more. I however use cornflakes crumbs instead of bread crumbs. I also put 1/3 cup parsley; I use 1/4 cup ketchup instead of water and 1 teaspoons soy sauce. Just a thought from an old chef.
6. Sometime I used frozen meatballs. Most jellied cranberry sauce come in 16 oz cans so if you decide to use the whole can you'll need to double all the other ingredients. Typical chili sauce comes in 12oz. bottle so you'll need two bottles if you use the full can of cranberry. Hope this helps your shopping.
7. I have made these numerous times and am ashamed to admit I'm just now reviewing them. Wonderful addition to the regular grape jelly recipes out there with great meatballs --  Based on experience and personal preference with these cocktail meatballs I offer the following suggestions: 1.) Add one packet of Lipton onion soup mix to the meatball mixture if you do not have time to mince or grate the onion. 2.) Bake meatballs over a drip pan to reduce the fat before adding to the sauce. 3.) If using frozen meatballs ENSURE you DO NOT use Italian meatballs as this upsets the balance of the meatballs and sauce (yuck)! 3.) Make the sauce the day before to let the flavors marry - I can't stress what a difference this makes! This recipe gets better the next day. 4.) The Heinz sauce in the round bottle seems to be the best chili sauce for this mixture. Reviewers: I seriously dislike people that rate a recipe based on the changes they have made to the original. I want to state that I rated this recipe on the recipe Lara submitted. The changes I suggested were based on my family's personal preference.,

instructions, 1. Slice 1 onion lengthways and set aside 4 of the best-shaped slices; then finely chop the remaining onions and the garlic.
2. Heat half the butter in a pan over a medium heat add the meat in batches and cook for 5 minutes turning until well-browned; trnsfer to a plate and keep warm.
3. Heat the remaining butter in the pan and add the onions and garlic and sauté stirring for 5 minutes or until they have softened; stir in the flour and cook stirring until it has browned.
4. Return the meat to the panstir in the stock worcestershire sauce red wine and tomato paste and season to taste with the salt and pepper; bring to the boil then reduce the heat to low and simmer covered for 1½ hours or until the meat is tender.
5. Preheat the oven to 200°C.
6. Divide  the meat mixture to four  individual (about 11cm x 14.5cm) pie dishes.
7. Cut the pastry to fit the tops and place an onion slice on each piece of pastry and score a very shallow line with a knife around each slice to allow the pastry to rise above the onion.  From the leftover pastry cut thin strips to place along the rims of each dish and press the strips onto the rims firmly.  Brush the rims with egg then place the pastry lids on the pie dishes and use a fork to press all around the edges.  Cut a small hole in the top to allow the steam to escape.
8. Bake for 15- 20 minutes or until the pastry is puffed and golden.
9. Notes: Dried and ground bush tomato is a delicious alternative to tomato paste. On the bottle it is described as having "a wonderful subtle flavour of delicate caramelised sun-dried tomato with a slight bitter taste to it".  I am now using it in all recipes which require tomato paste.,

instructions, 1. 1. In a medium saucepan over medium heat combine 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup cream and 1/4 cup butter. Heat until butter is melted stirring occasionally. In a small bowl whisk together the cornstarch 2 tablespoons milk and vanilla; stir into saucepan. Cook until thickened stirring constantly. Remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly.
2. 2. Preheat oven to 400*F. In a medium bowl combine the apples flour and cinnamon. Mix well.
3. 3. Line a 9 inch pie pan with pie dough. Pour thickened filling mixture into pastry-lined pie pan. Arrange apple mixture evenly over filling. Top with second crust seal and flute the edges. Cut slits in top crust.
4. 4. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until crust is golden brown and apples are tender. Cool for at least 30 minutes.
5. 5. In small bowl combine confectioners' sugar 1 tablespoon milk 1/4 teaspoon vanilla and 1 tablespoon softened butter. Blend until smooth; pour evenly over warm pie. Refrigerate for AT LEAST 1 1/2 hours before serving (longer is better).
6. My Note:   I also added a little cinnamon to the glaze which added just the right extra touch in my opinion. Try this- you'll love it. Oh- and warm each slices in the microwave about 25-30 seconds. It's so much better that way! A couple of suggestions: 1) The recipe suggests serving the pie cold but try it at room temperature or slightly warm (30 seconds in the microwave should do it) 2) The thinner your apple slices the better!  Try it with pear and/or peach. Adding walnut pieces is a nice variation. Use aluminum foil at the end of baking to keep the crust from getting too brown. A little extra cinnamon or lemon zest in the glaze is good. (I use an extra deep dish make a lattice top and extra custard and glaze.) Make 2 and hide 1 if you want leftovers. Delicious!,

instructions, 1. In a medium saucepan brown the meat add the chopped onion and cook till soft. Stir in the flour then gradually mix in the stock. When all the stock is included add the vegetables seasonings and sauces a little salt and pepper and simmer for 15-20 minutes stirring regularly.
2. While the mixture is cooking prepare the potatoes for the topping as follows:
3. Peel the potatoes and place in a saucepan of cold water. Add the salt and bring to the boil. Simmer until the potatoes are soft. Drain then return the pan of potatoes to the heat and dry them off completely. This helps produce fluffy mashed spuds. Mash them with a fork or potato masher until broken up then add the low-fat spread. Continue mashing adding enough warm milk to give a creamy consistency. I use a masher to start with then change to a fork to give the potatoes a final whip. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. To assemble the cottage pies lightly grease a 12-cup muffin pan and line the cups with pastry; if you can re-roll the trimmings 2 sheets should be enough. Divide the meat mixture between the pans and top with the mashed potato. Press it into place with a fork or squeeze it through a piping bag fitted with a large star nozzle.
5. Bake in a preheated oven at 190°C for 15-20 minutes until pastry is crisp and potato is turning golden.,

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat the oven to 375*F. Place potatoes in a saucepan and add enough water to cover. Bring to boil and cook until tender but still firm about 10 minutes. Drain and cool in a bowl of cold water.
2. 2. Cook bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned. Drain crumble and set aside.
3. 3. Remove cooled potatoes from water. Pat dry with a paper towel and cut in half. Using a small spoon carefully remove a small amount from center leaving approximately 1/4 inch rim around each potato. Set reserved potato aside.
4. 4. In a bowl mix together reserved potato sour cream bacon seasoned salt pepper and chives. Spoon a small amount of mixture into each potato half and place on a baking sheet. Top each potato off with some shredded cheese.
5. 5. Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven or until cheese is melted and potatoes are warmed through. Garnish with parsley and serve.
6. My Note:  I cooked my potatoes in the micowave for abcou 5 minues. Cut the edges so they could stand on their own without rolling. An easy trick for these potatoes is to cut in half raw. Scoop out the potato. Salt water and boil the skins. Red potatos are very easy to scoop out raw. Cook the scooped out potato as you would mashed potates. and proceed with receipe. saves time and aggrevation of skins breaking. I used my processor to mix butter cream cheese salt pepper onion powder & parsley to my taste. I coated the skins with olive oil to get them crisp and baked for 15 minutes. I added some garlic powder and melted butter. I thought it was better with these additions more calories but I never skimp on calories when I am feeding guests.
7. Apparently our small red potatoes were larger than Maddiecat's as it only took 10 to make 1 1/2 lbs. I just boiled them for about 16 minutes until firm but tender. I also didn't have chives so I grated in about 1 tsp of onion. The result was outstanding. I do think they are too rich to be used as a side dish as I recommended the first time but they are a real winner as an appetizer.,

instructions, 1. Peel and grate the potatoes and the onion into a small mixing bowl.
2. (I use the grating blade of my food processor but grating by hand works just as well.) Stir in the egg and the flour.
3. If the batter looks to runny add a little more flour- if it is too dry add a splash of milk.
4. Season well with pepper and salt and any other optional ingredients.
5. Melt oil and butter together in a medium frypan and heat until sizzling.
6. You can now add the batter in one of two ways: Dad's Method- Add spoonfuls of batter to the pan to form circles about 8-10cm (4 inches) in diameter.
7. Cook for about 5 minutes on each side or until golden brown.
8. Cook in batches of 2 or 3 and keep warm on a plate in an oven set on a low temperature.
9. My Method- Tip all of the batter into the frypan and flatten it out with the back of a spoon so that it fills the whole pan evenly.
10. Cook on one side for about 5 minutes then invert a dinner plate over the top of the pan and tip the potato cake onto the plate.
11. Now simply slide the cake back into the pan and cook on the other side for about 5 minutes.
12. When both sides are cooked invert the potato cake onto the plate again and cut it into wedges.
13. Serve topped with mayonnaise sour cream or ranch dressing and chopped chives or chopped green onions.,

Cover with the remainder of the rosemary and the garlic cloves. Completely cover pan with cooking foil and tuck it in firmly all around. Place into preheated oven and cook for approx 4 hours (depending on size of roast). Do not remove foil during cooking time when cooked properly meat should be moist and tender and should also fall away from bone very easily.
5. About 1 hour before roast is cooked peel potatoes and carrots.  Cut into large cubes put into saucepan with salt to taste and cook until it is soft enough to roughly mash.
6. Whilst potato is cooking prepare silverbeet or spinach leaves.  Cut off most of the white stalks and roughly chop green leaves.  Place into cold water salted to taste.  Bring to boil turn heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes.

Pick garlic cloves up in your fingers (careful they may still be a little hot) gently squeeze them and the cooked garlic will come out of the outer shell. Mash some of it (about 6-7 cloves) put into baking pan mix in rest of flour gently mix in the chicken stock so that you do not get any lumps. When this is done place all the fresh mint into the gravy and put pan over a light to medium heat and stir continuously until it thickens.

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 180°C Butter a 22cm square cake tin and line the base and sides with buttered baking paper. Dust the tin with the polenta tap out the excess and set tin aside.
2. Pile the grated zucchini into a large sieve or colander sit a plate on top to weigh it down a little and leave zucchini to drain really well.
3. Break the eggs into a large bowl and whisk them together. Add the oil chives and dill mint or basil and whisk them inches
4. Press down firmly on the plate over the zucchini to squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Stir the grated zucchini into the egg mixture. Crumble in most of the feta (reserving a little for the top of the pie) along with the parmesan and season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the flour and mix  in until it is combined (wearing disposable gloves and mixing by hand is good as mixture gets quite thick). Spread the batter into the prepared tin and sprinkle the reserved feta over the top. Gently press the cherry tomato halves cut side up into the surface of the pie.
5. Bake pie for 45-50 minutes or until the top of the pie is springy when pressed. (It’s a bit hard to know when it’s cooked. Belinda Jeffery's suggests --   Her first attempt seemed ready after 30 minutes but when she took it out and let it cool a little she realised it was still squishy in the centre so she put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes (thank goodness it’s forgiving!). So when you think it’s cooked make sure the top is quite bouncy and to double-check insert the tip of a fine knife down into the middle and press the two sides of the cut apart - it should look quite set.
6. When it’s ready take the pie out of the oven and cool it in the tin for 10 -15 minutes. If you’re feeling game you can just gently grasp the baking paper and lift the pie out of the tin onto a serving plate then slide the paper out from underneath. Or put a wire rack on top and invert the pie onto the rack. Peel away the paper then sit your serving platter on top of the pie and invert it again onto this. Tidy up any straggly bits and brush the tomatoes with a little oil. Scatter some mint leaves or sprigs on top and serve.,

Slowly stir in milk as not to allow lumps to form until all of the milk has been added. Continue stirring over medium-low heat until thick 4 to 5 minutes.
3. 3. Stir the milk mixture into the stockpot and cook soup until heated through. Serve immediately.
4. My Note:  We don't care for cooked celery so I use a little celery seed . I use this recipe as a base also with many variations  such as --  no meat at all  italian sausage & extra onion (my favorite) diced chicken breast & (presteamed) broccoli (my grandkids' favorite !)and coming soon .garlic chicken breast baby carrots frozen corngreen beans and coarsely chopped onion. Making the white sauce separately really added the right creaminess to the potato/ham & veggie mixture. I used a can of chicken broth for part of the liquid as I didn't have any bullion. Also threw in some shredded carrots I had on hand plus 1/2 cup shredded cheese to the white sauce after it had thickened. Also (to disguise the carrots) added a sprinkle of cheese to each bowl upon serving. Very creamy and tasty. Maybe a possibly of adding corn next time.,

5. Mix 2 teaspoons of reserved juice and maple syrup and heat in a microwave proof container (about 20 seconds at 50% heat in a 900 Watt microwave) - the original recipe suggested heating in a small pan my suggestion if you do not have a microwave is put the maple syrup and juice in a heat proof container and heat in a water bath on top of the stove.

name, Prime Rib Roast, 
cuisine, Australasian >> Australian >> Australian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. 1. Prepare grill for indirect grilling with a large dripping pan under where the roast will be. Aim for a grill temperature around 375*F. Periodically add water to the pan to keep the drippings from burning away if you want to make gravy. Make sure you know the weight of your prime rib. Plan on grilling indirectly for 12 to 14 minutes per pound. If you are using a smaller roast adjust the ingredients and cooking times accordingly.
2. 2. With a sharp paring knife make a series of 1/2 inch deep holes every 2 inches all over the roast. Insert the garlic slivers in every other hole and a leaf from the rosemary in the rest. Combine black pepper dried rosemary salt and paprika and rub over the surface of the meat. When the grill is ready place the roast on the well oiled grate directly over the dripping pan. Cook for about 12 to 14 minutes per pound. An 18 pound roast will take about 3 1/2 to 4 hours. It is very important to use an accurate meat thermometer to check for doneness. You do not want to over cook this roast.
3. 3. When the meat reaches an internal temperature of 115 to 125*F. remove it from the grill. Place it on a platter and cover loosely with foil. The meat will continue cooking and the internal temperature will continue to rise. Let rest for at least 15 minutes but no more than 30. If you want the roast rare to medium rare remove from the grill when the temperature is 115*F. and let it rest for 15 minutes. If you want it more well done remove from the grill at 125*F. and let it rest for 30 minutes.
4. My Note:    I made a 7 rib 12.21 lb prime rib with this receipe for Easter and to day that it was wonderful is a understatement. I did not use the dried rosemary on the rub since I but extra garlic and fresh rosemary in the slits and I am glad that I used the fresh instead. everyone raved aboutit and this 24 people. I could not make copies fast enough for all the people who wanted the recipe. The best thing is once it was on the grill I didn't need to think about it at all. UPDATE:  I used fresh rosemary and garlic as suggested. Only change - I used cayenne ILO of paprika in my rub. Cooked faster than recipe said but turned out medium to medium rare with internal temp of 140 when I pulled it off the grill. I used a Brinkman four flame gas grill and tried to keep the temp at 325*F. My roast was 14.5 pounds and total cooking time was just under 3 hours. Everyone love it - so that is my measure.,

instructions, 1. In a 3-qt. slow cooker combine soup flour pepper and cayenne until smooth. Stir in chicken celery green pepper and onion. Cover and cook on low for 4-5 hours or until meat juices run clear. Stir in peas and pimientos. Cook 30 minutes longer or until heated through. Serve with rice.
2. My Note:   I have made this several times. It is much better if you use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup so there is more sauce for over the rice. I thicken it a bit at the end with some cornstarch until it's the consistency I like. You don't want it too thick though because the rice will soak up the tasty sauce. I add garlic and a couple diced carrots and some extra seasoning like Emeril's Essence. I add fresh parsley at the end too. This really is a good recipe. I actually liked it better the 2nd day after it had thickened some.
3. This is really good. I made some changes to reduce the fat/calories a bit. I use the 98%FF cream of chicken and a little less chicken with more veggies. I use frozen peas and carrots and add about a teaspoons of garlic powder. I love slow cooker meals and this one turns out great every time.  This is a good old-fashioned recipe for everyone's recipe file in my opinion.,

instructions, 1. Using a vegetable peeler peel random strips of skin from the eggplants; save the skins for use in my Vegetable Stock Recipe #135453; slice the eggplants thinly.
2. Heat the oil in a large - preferably non-stick - pan.  Make sure that the oil is hot (but not so hot that the crumbed eggplant slices burn) before adding each batch of crumbed eggplant slices so that the surface is immediately sealed; eggplant is notorious for absorbing oil and will do just that if the oil is too cool and you'll end up using a very large quantity of oil!
3. Mix the minced garlic and dried basil with the breadcrumbs.
4. Coat the eggplant slices in flour; shake off the excess; dip in the egg then in the breadcrumb mixture; shallow-fry in batches until lightly browned; drain on absorbent paper.
5. Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan-forced/400°F/gas mark 6.
6. Mix cheeses together and mix in the walnuts (if using).
7. Spread about one-third of the pasta sauce over the base of a well-greased 2.5 litre (10-cup) ovenproof dish; top with about one-third of the eggplant one-third of the cheeses and one-third of the oregano; repeat layering.
8. Bake covered for 20 minutes; uncover (and add chopped bacon if using); bake for 10 minutes or until the surface is lightly browned (and the bacon if using is cooked and crisped).,

2. Insert the butterfly. Crack the egg into the TM bowl add salt and ACV. Mix for 1-2 minutes on 37 degrees speed 4. The time it takes to reach 37 degrees will vary based on how cold your ingredients were to begin with. You don't have to wait the full 2 minutes - stop whenever the 37 degrees light stops flashing and becomes constantly lit.
3. If you stopped early in step 2 be sure to zero the timer (press + and - at the same time) and press the power button (just press don't hold down) to turn the temperature setting off. Then set the timer for 6 minutes.
4. With the butterfly still in place turn the blades on to speed 4. With the blades running and the MC inverted begin to slowly pour the oil onto the lid. Try to pour at a relatively steady pace (don't stress too much though the MC will compensate for any over-enthusiasm with the oil) and take almost the full 6 minutes to add in the oil. Let the blades run for another 10-15 seconds after all the oil has gone inches.,

2. Beat the egg whites in a small bowl with an electric mixer until firm peaks o the potato mixture.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil with 20g of the butter in a non-stick pan; cook heaped tablespoons of the potato mixture uncovered until browned on both sides; drain the pancakes on absorbent kitchen paper and cover to keep warm; repeat with the same amounts of the remaining oil butter and potato mixture.
4. Notes: One Australian measuring cup holds approximately 250ml (8 fluid ounces) one Australian tablespoon holds 20ml and one Australian teaspoon holds 5ml.  North America New Zealand and the United Kingdom use a 15ml tablespoon. In this recipe the addition of the rosemary and sage is really best guided by taste.  I never measure herbs.,

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat the oven on broiler setting.
2. 2. In a large bowl combine the roma tomatoes sun-dried tomatoes garlic olive oil vinegar basil salt and pepper. Allow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes.
3. 3. Cut the baguette into 3/4-inch slices. On a baking sheet arrange the baguette slices in a single layer. Broil for 1 to 2 minutes until slightly brown.
4. 4. Divide the tomato mixture evenly over the baguette slices. Top the slices with mozzarella cheese.
5. 5. Broil for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
6. My Note:   Here are a few tips from someone who has made this recipe at least a dozen times: 1) Once I couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil and used the dry kind. Perhaps it was my imagination but I think I lost some of that distinctive sun-dried tomato flavor. 2) The recipe suggests that you could use dried basil if you're in a pinch. That's true but use it ONLY if you're in pinch! Fresh basil (I chiffonade mine) is part of what makes this recipe so absolutely delicious. 3) The recipe calls for shredded cheese but I like to buy bulk mozzarella and slice it into pieces that are about 1/8" thick and that are sized to fit onto the bruschetta. That keeps your cheese from falling off the sides and it creates a nice "blanketing" effect over your tomato mixture that keeps it from falling off when you're eating it. Enjoy!
7. UPDATE:   My friends felt there was something missing and next time I plan on adding some fresh cut Oregano and doubling the garlic. I also plan on cutting the amount of olive oil used in half to only 1/8 cup. From the suggestions of previous a friends I decided to brush olive oil onto the bread broil it for a couple minutes then add the topping. The cutting of the tomatoes did take a bit of time and I think substituting a couple cans of diced tomatoes would be fine. Just be sure to use FRESH herbs!
8. After thinking about it I would definitely suggest letting it marinate over night - the longer the better. I also took someone's suggestion to put the cheese on the bread and bake it first - then everyone can put on their own amount of bruschetta. Everyone agreed that was the better way to go. This really is easy to make - I also definitely suggest using fresh basil and buying the bread the day you are serving it as well. I will be adding this part to my receipe box to add to my regular rotation.
9. Have made it many times Now.And YES There is a reason this recipe lists roma/plum tomatoes as the tomato of choice. They are meatier than a beefsteak early girl or some of the other varietals available. Using romas will eliminate some of the wateriness that I have mentioned. If you have the opportunity to make this a day ahead it gives the flavors a chance to marry and allows the garlic to mellow somewhat ~ so MUCH better! Absolutely great as it is but decided to try adding a smidgen of anchovy paste to it on the third time. It sent it over the edge from outstanding to sublime!
10. Update: 9/17/13 - 5 or 6 tomatoes roma (plum) tomato chopped  2 cups a #1 Tall can =16 oz. and a #300 can =14 to 16 oz. Canned would work but be sure to drain it well or your bread will get very soggy.
11. Many recipes specify a can size rather than a volume amount.
12. I've tried a bunch of them! Here are a few tips from someone who has made this recipe at least a dozen times: 1) Once I couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil and used the dry kind. Perhaps it was my imagination but I think I lost some of that distinctive sun-dried tomato flavor. 2) The recipe suggests that you could use dried basil if you're in a pinch. That's true but use it ONLY if you're in pinch!

That keeps your cheese from falling off the sides and it creates a nice "blanketing" effect over your tomato mixture that keeps it from falling off when you're eating it. I hope this help.

cuisine, Australasian >> Australian >> New Zealander, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Take the corned beef/silverside out of the plastic wrapping and wash it off in cold water. (makes it less slippery and easier to handle).
2. Take the whole cloves and stick the little spike part of each clove well into the meat. (sometimes you need to make a little hole into the meat with the point of a veggie knife in order to get it in).  Stud the entire piece of meat evenly with cloves using more than 40 of them if necessary).
3. Put the golden syrup into the bottom of a large tall saucepan (I use a big soup pot).
4. Put the meat into the pot add the bay leaf and pepper halve the oranges and squeeze them to get some juice out over the meat drop the squeezed oranges into the pot as well.
5. Cover with water and simmer for 1.5 to 2.5 hours depending on how big the piece of meat is --  even a small bit does really well on low for 1.5-2 hours. Top up the water if necessary.
6. Take out and rest the meat for 10 minutes. Pick out what cloves you can (they are really there for flavour not to be eaten) Cut across the grain. (if you do it the wrong way your "slice" of meat will fall into 1000 tiny pieces so just turn the meat around and cut at right angles to your first cut if that happens.).
7. Cut it into thin slices. Serve with mustard sauce (if you can already keep your hands from nibbling it off plate).
8. Prepare to taste corned beef like you've never tasted it before -- ummmmm --.
9. Serves 4 in theory but I have to confess that DH and I we could eat one small one each. <blush> LOL nibble nibble just a little bit more nibble nibble opps  gone!
10. Served cold it also makes great sandwiches --  but in our house there's rarely enough left over to make a sandwich :).,

cuisine, Australasian >> Australian >> New Zealander, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Sprinkle the gelatin over the hot water and stir until the gelatin dissolves.
2. Add the mayonnaise lemon juice and tomato ketchup.  The tomato ketchup is there to add a little flavour but mainly to add pink colour to the mousse.  You don’t want white mousse with bits of pink salmon in it.
3. Add salt and pepper to taste remembering that the salmon may be salty so don’t add too much salt.
4. Flake the hot smoked salmon.
5. Cut the cold smoke salmon into 1cm squares.
6. Fold both the salmons through the mousse.  Try to not break the flaked salmon up so that there is still some texture in the mousse.
7. Check the seasoning and adjust if needed.
8. Fill a 2 cup jelly mould or a fish mould if you have one and refrigerate for 2 hours or until the gelatin sets.
9. Make a bed of shredded lettuce on a large platter.
10. Turn the mould out on to the lettuce.  I had to line my mould with clingfilm because it rusted sightly which makes it easier to remove from the mould but you lose some detail.You may need to briefly dunk the mould into hot water. Don’t be tempted to leave it sitting in hot water.  The gelatin will soften very quickly.
11. Thinly slice a cucumber and use it to garnish around the base of the turned out mousse.
12. Finely chop some dill and scatter over the top of the mousse.
13. Cut the lemon into wedges and serve around the mousse.
14. Serve with crusty bread as a light lunch or reduce the gelatin to 5g and serve with crackers as a dip.  This is an excellent buffet table dish too.
15. ==================================.
16. To serve this as a starter instead of filling a ring mould or other mould:
17. Line a 6-muffin muffin tray with circles of waxed paper.
18. Put a slice of cold smoked salmon on top of each circle.
19. Add 1/3 cup of mousse to each muffin cup.
20. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
21. Plate up individual servings of mousse by dressing the plate with lettuce turning out a salmon mousse (and remove the wax paper) garnish with dill on top and cucumber and a lemon wedge on the side.
22. ==================================.
23. Cooking for a large crowd:
24. Scale up the recipe and pour into a large roasting tin and put in the fridge to set.  Cut into squares with a knife dipped in hot water. Remove slices with a spatula or fish slice. Serve top side up with the same garnish as above.,

instructions, 1. SAUCE: In a microwave safe container combine all the sauce ingredients and cook on high til it's all melted together. Usually takes a couple of minutes to melt it all.
2. PUDDING: While the sauce is microwaving get a large microwave-safe bowl (I often use a casserole dish) and throw in all the Pudding ingredients except the milk then gradually add the milk while stirring until it forms a soft moist dough. It's important to use a large bowl because the dough will rise quite a bit as it cooks.
3. COMBINE FOR DELICIOUSNESS: Pour all the sauce over the dough then put it in the microwave a cook on high for 7 minutes.
4. SERVE: You can have this on it's own but I like to have it either with fresh cream or vanilla ice cream. I'll use a Kiwi (New Zealand) saying meaning you'll like this - "Sweet As!" Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Use a pencil to mark the outline of a 10” disc on a piece of parchment paper. Turn the paper over and lay it in a half sheet pan then set aside.
2. Add the egg whites with a pinch of salt to a dry clean bowl of your stand mixer. Using the whip attachment begin whipping the egg whites to create a French meringue.
3. Once they have become very frothy and starting to turn white add the sugar 1/4 cup at a time until it is all incorporated and has formed very stiff peaks. Next add the vinegar vanilla and sifted cornstarch and continue beating until it is incorporated.
4. Pour this out onto your parchment paper and use an offset spatula to spread out the meringue. Bake this in a preheated 250 degrees F oven for 1 hour and then turn off the oven and allow the meringue to cool completely before removing from the oven.
5. Once cooled whip the cream with the powdered sugar and vanilla to stiff peaks. Feel free to add more sugar if you prefer. Top the entire Pavlova with the whipped cream.
6. In the meantime rinse your berries and set aside. Add the apple jelly to a microwave safe bowl and heat it until melted.
7. Toss this into the berries and add them on top of the whipped cream. The apple jelly gives that beautiful shine to the berries and is perfect to use here. It seals and glazes the fruit beautifully. Serve immediately.
8. Note: You can make the meringue disc ahead of time and then decorate it right before service. If you put the disc together with the whipped cream too far in advance and refrigerate the meringue will get soggy. So make sure to prepare the disc the day before and allow it to cool completely then cover and store at room temperature until you are ready to put the cake together.,
