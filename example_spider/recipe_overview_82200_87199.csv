instructions, 1. Roasted Poblanos: Rub the chilies lightly with oil and place them on a stovetop grill or directly over an open flame. Grill over medium-high heat and turn using metal tongs until the skins are evenly blistered and charred. Remove from the heat transfer to a bowl and cover with a plate or a lid; they'll steam as they cool. Loosen and peel the skins from the chilies. Bits of charred skin are ok. You can dip your fingers in water but don't be tempted to dip the chilies in water or peel them under the running faucet-you'll lose their delicious flavor.
2. Salad: Bring a small pot of water to a boil and drop in the onions for 20 seconds. Drain and toss with the vinegar.
3. Heat the oil in a large sautÃ© pan. Add the corn 1/4 teaspoons salt and sautÃ© over medium heat for about 1 minute. Add the water lower the heat and cover the pan. Simmer covered until the corn is tender about 5 minutes.
4. Transfer to a bowl and toss with the chilies onions lime juice 1/4 teaspoons salt and a pinch of cayenne. Set aside to cool.
5. Just before serving add the cilantro and season to taste with salt and cayenne.
6. Tip: To make this salad even easier you can prepare the separate elements ahead of time and combine them at the last minute. The poblano chilies keep well for several days in the refrigerator or can be frozen and defrosted just before serving.,

instructions, 1. Take your dried chilies cut them open and remove all the seeds (you may want to use gloves if your particularly sensitive). Put the chilies in a deep heat resistant bowl.
2. Fill a medium sized saucepan with water and bring to a boil.
3. Pour the boiling water over the chilies cover the bowl with a lid or plate and let it sit for 10-15 minutes until the chilies are soft.
4. Add the chilies cumin salt garlic onion and chicken broth into the blender.  Puree the ingredients until it looks clear and smooth.  Add more broth if it looks a little too thick.
5. Take a deep sauce pan and add just a tablespoon or so of oil into it. Strain the sauce into the saucepan. (This is optional but I like to do this to keep the skins of the chilies out of the sauce).  Then let the sauce simmer for about another 5 minutes and taste it!  If you feel it needs more salt now is the time to add it.
6. Let the sauce cool down.
7. Heat the 1/4 cup of oil and take your tortillas and fry them one at a time for about 30- 40 seconds. (You donât want them to get crispy as this will make it difficult to roll).  A big metal spatula is what I use for this step.  You may also need to add more oil depending on the level of the oil as you fry your tortillas.
8. Take your tortilla dip them in the cooled sauce and fill them with the Chihuahua or Mexican shredded cheese and onion filling. Start from the edge and roll it tightly. Now place on a baking dish.
9. Preheat your oven to 350Â°F Keep doing steps 7 & 8 until you have made about 24 enchiladas.
10. Take your garnish cheese and drizzle all over the enchiladas and bake until the cheese has melted. Serve with sour cream and avocado slices.,

2. After soaking bring the rice mixture to a boil over high heat. When it starts to boil lower heat to medium and cook for 10 to 12 more minutes or until water is almost evaporated.
3. While rice is cooking beat the egg. Add the milk and stir well to mix. Add the egg mixture vanilla and condensed milk to the rice and cook over medium-low heat stirring carefully until it thickens slightly or to desired consistency about 25-35 minutes. Stir in raisins if desired. I sometimes also like to add a bit of ground cinnamon. Let cool uncovered. The rice will thicken as it cools but will be thinner than traditional rice pudding.,

instructions, 1. Watermelon cubes: Cut the ends off of the watermelon. Remove the rind from the melon by standing the watermelon up on one of the flat cut ends then running a knife down the length of the melon just deep enough to cut off all of the green/white rind part. Continue cutting the rind off the melon until all you are left with is the meat of the fruit. From this point trim the edges to create a large straight-edged rectangle. Dice 2/3 cup of watermelon in to cm or smaller uniform cubes using the excess pieces from trimming the rectangle. Set the diced aside in a mixing bowl reserved for the salad. From the large rectangle cut out either all 2-3 inch cubes or varying sizes of rectangles and cubes to use for your watermelon cups. Once you have achieved this using a paring knife and a melon baller or small spoon cut/scoop out the middle of each rectangle leaving about 1 cm wall of melon on the edges and the bottom. Repeat this process until all the watermelon cups have been hollowed out. Place all of the watermelon cups on a plate/tray loosely cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to be filled.
2. Salad: In the mixing bowl with the reserved diced watermelon add the diced jicama peaches sweet onion garlic jalapeno cilantro and lime juice. Toss gently to combine and thoroughly coat all of the ingredients with the lime juice to prevent them from oxidizing and turning brown. Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Set aside.
3. Cream sauce: To a bowl add the cream fraiche chopped cilantro lime juice jalapeno and feta. Stir to combine thoroughly. Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper.
4. Liberally fill each of the watermelon cups with the fruit salad. Garnish with a little dollop of cream sauce and a small cilantro leaf. Serve immediately.,

instructions, 1. To prepare marinade begin by first toasting the chiles in a hot skillet for a minute or so until they begin to emit a peppery fragrance. Cast iron works best.
2. Remove tops from peppers and split into 2 or 3 large pieces.  If you want a milder sauce discard the seeds. Place the pieces in a cup of boiling water for 20 minutes to soften.
3. Loosely drain water and place chiles in a blender with the garlic salt pepper brown sugar orange zest orange segments orange juice concentrate and broth. Blend into a pureÃ©.
4. Place the marinade in a resealable bag or container.  Add the chops and marinade in the  ice box for 8 to 24 hours.  Longer really is better.
5. To prepare the chops remove chops from marinade and lightly pat dry.  Reserve marinade for the sauce.
6. Heat skillet until hot but not smoking.  Add a little oil to coat the pan.  Cook pork chops for 1 to 2 minutes on each side to get a nice brown sear. Reduce the heat to medium and add in the resrved marinade.  Cook for 15 to 20 minutes until the chops are tender.
7. Remove chops from pan and place on plate and tent to keep hot.  If you would like a thicker more intensely flavored sauce reduce heat a small amount and cook down for a few minutes.,

instructions, 1. Chicken Preparation:
2. Preheat grill to medium-high heat.
3. In a small bowl combine seasonings.
4. Pound chicken breasts to 1/2-inch thickness.
5. Season both sides of chicken breasts.
6. Grill chicken breasts for 8-10 minutes on each side or until cooked through.
7. Allow chicken to cool for 10-15 minutes and then slice into thin pieces.
8. Chicken may be broiled instead of a grilled per your preference.
9. Quesadilla Assembly:
10. On two dinner plates place one flour tortilla onto each.
11. Sprinkle each evenly with 1/2 cup shredded cheese (1/4 cup on each).
12. Arrange sliced chicken breast evenly attop each cheese layer.
13. Cover each chicken layer with tomato slices (6 slices on each).
14. Sprinkle each evenly with cilantro (1 tbs. on each) and scallions (1 tbs. on each).
15. Sprinkle each evenly with remaining 1/2 cup shredded cheese (1/4 cup on each).
16. Top with remaining two flour tortillas (one on each).
17. Cooking the Quesadillas:
18. While assembling the quesadillas preheat an electric griddle to 350 F (or grill to medium-high heat).  I use a griddle (rather than a grill) to cook quesadillas as it is easier to turn them without losing their insides.
19. Brush 1 tbs. olive oil onto the griddle covering the surface.
20. Brush the remaining 1 tbs. olive oil onto the top exposed flour tortilla.
21. Gently slide each quesadilla from each dinner plate onto the griddle (olive oil-less side down).
22. Cook for 5-7 minutes or until bottom tortilla begins to brown.
23. With a large spatula gently but swiftly turn each quesadilla to brown other side.
24. Cook for 5-7 minutes or until bottom tortilla begins to brown.
25. Remove to a cutting board and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
26. Slice into eighths.
27. Serve immediately with garnish of your preference.  I like to use sour cream salsa or guacamole.,

instructions, 1. First prepare the Pinto beans according to the directions on the packaging. This may require an overnight soak. When cooking the beans only cook them about halfway. You can prepare the stock as they cook.
2. Next prepare the stock: Fill a large pot with 6 cups of water and bring to a low boil. Coarsely chop Onion and add to pot. Cut up 1 avocado into large pieces and add to pot. Cut the top off of the HabaÃ±ero pepper and add to pot. Break flounder fillet into small pieces and add to pot. Whisk 1 tablespoons of Wasabi mustard into the pot. Add 1 tablespoons of Horseradish to pot. Finally add the partially cooked pinto beans to the pot. Now let the whole mixture simmer for about 1 hour.
3. While the stock simmers you can prepare the base: Cut up the 2 remaining avocados and place in a blender. Add another 1 tablespoons of Wasabi mustard to the blender along with 1/4 cup of water. Scoop out the other avocado and the HabaÃ±ero pepper from the stock pot and add to the blender. Blend these ingredients until they are fully purÃ©ed. You may need to add another 1/4 cup of water.
4. Now strain the stock through a colander to remove the onion fish pieces and beans but KEEP the strained liquid. That is your stock. You can discard the onions fish and beans or use them in another dish. I added them to some whole grain rice for a healthy fiber-rich side dish.
5. Pour the strained stock back into the large pot. Put it on medium-low heat and gradually whisk in the avocado purÃ©e until fully blended. Add salt and pepper to taste.
6. Tip: If the soup is too thin let it simmer for a while and it will reduce and get thicker. If the soup is too thick you can add a bit of water.,

instructions, 1. DIP:
2. Put the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che (or other option) into a medium-sized mixing bowl.
3. Zest the lime finely and mix the zest into the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che.
4. Roll the lime on your counter placing enough pressure to soften the pulp inside without breaking the lime's skin.
5. Cut the lime in half and squeeze the juice from one half reserving the other half for another use.
6. While stirring slowly add the juice to the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che until you get a consistency just the runny side of mayonnaise.
7. Add a couple of pinches of ground chipotle stir in and taste repeating until you have both a heat and smokiness you like.  If you are making this a day or two ahead of time stop adding the chile when you are just shy of how strong you think you'd like it to be.  It will get stronger overnight.
8. FRITTERS:
9. Mix the flour & water in a medium-sized bowl until absolutely smooth.
10. Put a heavy-weight frying pan on the stove on medium heat and put a paper towel lined plate nearby.
11. Halve an avocado from top to bottom.  Twist to remove section from pit then remove the pit from the other half.  Cut each half into four wedges and remove the skin.
12. Add oil to the pan.
13. Dip each section of avocado into the batter leaving only a very thin layer of batter on each and add the wedges to the pan one at a time as you batter them.  By the lime the last is in it will be time to turn the first.  Cook each side until golden brown (you will need to turn them to cook on three sides - tongs or a spatula & fork work best).
14. When done place each fritter on the towel-lined plate to remove excess oil.
15. Sprinkle a little salt over the fritters plate and serve hot with dipping sauce.,

instructions, 1. Pico de Gallo: In a bowl combine tomatoes onion jalapeÃ±os cilantro and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. The salsa is best prepared for optimum flavor 1 hour in advance.
2. Meat: Cook *beef and chorizo in a heated skillet breaking chorizo meat into small pieces until browned and cooked through. Set aside. *Although the chorizo is wonderfully seasoned my husband added a little more spices and such to the meat mixture: chipotle powder cumin part of a small cinnamon stick or small pinch of ground cinnamon Mexican oregano very small amount of salt-free garlic powder and black pepper -- that I can remember.
3. Heat up the refried beans and simmer on low until ready to serve. Add more cooking liquid if the beans start to dry out.
4. For the thick tortillas mix masa and salt in a bowl. Add 1 1/4 to 11/2 c of water and knead for 1-2 min until dough comes together and is pliable. (A food processor works well for this step.) If the dough seems too dry add more water a tablespoon or so at a time.
5. Divide dough into 8 equal portions and form into balls.
6. To Make Sopes: Press the dough with your fingers from the center outwards to create a shallow flat bowl approximately 5" in diameter. Heat 1" of vegetable oil in a skillet to 350Â° and fry tortillas approximately 2 min each side until golden brown. Remove from oil and place onto paper towels.
7. To Make Tostadas: Take each portion/ball of dough and flatten either with a tortilla press or with a rolling pin to about shy 1/2" thickness. Fry the same way as indicated in Step  above.
8. To assemble place a tortilla onto a plate top with refried beans ground beef and chorizo mix pico de gallo cheese and shredded cabbage/lettuce and radishes. Add a dollop of crema and garnish with cilantro and lime.
9. Serving suggestions: I placed the garnishes on a large platter for a "Build-Your-Own" Tostada Bar. Best part of this recipe? LEFTOVERS! Our sides: Recipe #117892 and Recipe #12740 (subbing strawberries Texas Red Star grapefruit and Valencia oranges for the melons.).,

instructions, 1. In a medium bowl thoroughly combine ONLY 1 cup of flour with the salt and baking powder.
2. Crumble in the margarine and mix well with your fingers breaking up any large clumps.
3. Add in the warm water (starting with the lower amount and add more as needed) and combine well. Do this for about 2 minutes until you have a nice ball of dough. Put the ball into the bowl and loosely cover with a damp paper towel. Place in refrigerator for 15 minutes.
4. Lightly sprinkle some of the remaining 1/3 cup flour onto a cutting board. Use some of the flour to coat a rolling pin.
5. Divide and roll the dough into approx 1" size balls (I got 7 total).
6. One at a time place each ball onto the floured board. Begin to roll the dough ball into a very thin disc. (I would say about 6" diameter or so but none of mine came out round. I had some pretty bizarre shapes). Place each flattened ball onto a plate and cover with the damp paper towel.
7. Heat a large non-stick skillet over a medium-low flame. DRY fry (no oil) one tortilla at a time. As each one gets lightly browned on both sides (about 2 minutes per side) remove to a clean plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Repeat until all the tortillas are fried up.
8. Serve and enjoy (I hope).,

instructions, 1. Sift the cocoa powder and flour.
2. Measure out 4 cups of milk.  From the 4 cups of milk slowly whisk about 1/4 cup of it a little more if necessary into the cocoa/flour mix until it becomes a paste. If you add milk too fast you get clumpy cocoa. If that happens use a hand blender to smooth it out.
3. When all the cocoa and flour are a paste (no more dry flour) add the remaining spices (sugar nutmeg cloves peppers and cinnamon).
4. Heat the rest of the 4 cups of milk in a double-boiler or a saucepan over medium.
5. Add the cocoa/flour/spices mix to the hot milk in the double-boiler. Stir constantly to keep it from burning.
6. If you prefer a slightly thicker drink you can add the optional cornstarch/water mixture now. Continue stirring on the heat until it's to your desired thickness. Not too long; you don't want to be forced to use a knife and fork. ;D.
7. When the cocoa is ready (it takes about 10-15 minutes until the flavor and heat level are *just right*) strain the cocoa in a fine sieve to remove the cloves and cinnamon pieces. (Careful it could splatter - I found out last night. *grrr*) Then add the powdered sugar and vanilla and stir.
8. If you like you can put whipped cream on top add small marshmallows or add a stick of cinnamon for stirring.,

instructions, 1. Sterilize all your equipment - spoons jars pots etc ahead of time.  It's important all of your tools be absolutely clean.
2. Assemble your spices and using either a coffee filter or a bit of cheesecloth make a sachet.
3. In a very large pot (preferably one with slightly thicker sides that will distribute the heat better) combine the milk sugar and vanilla and drop in the spice sachet.  Put it on a low heat and bring it just barely to a boil occasionally stirring and being careful not to scald the milk.
4. Once you can see bubbles rising remove the pot from heat.  Combine the baking soda with a little water and add it to the pot stirring it no more than once to incorporate.  Allow the bubbles to subside.
5. Put the pot back over a low heat and keep it just barely at a simmer stirring occasionally (this step will take at least a couple of hours and likely more) and ensuring the mixture does not burn.
6. When the mixture turns a rich mocha color and becomes more difficult to stir remove the sachet and increase the heat (but not enough to burn it).  At this point you will begin stirring more frequently and you will have to keep a closer eye on the pot.
7. The mixture will soon become viscous and develop a caramel color.  At this point you can test it by letting a drop fall into a glass of cold water.  If it coalesces into a solid ball the cajeta is ready.  Here you can take the cajeta off the heat and it will flow as a gooey syrup or if you want something more solid keep it over the heat until you can almost "slap" the surface of the cajeta with a spoon.
8. Allow the cajeta to cool then pour into glass containers.  Serve it warmed over ice cream with fruit in milk on your greedy fingers etc.,

instructions, 1. In a medium (dry) skillet on medium heat add the pork cracklins (chicharrones). Lightly fry them just so that they get warmed (about 2 minutes). Set aside.
2. In a medium sized bowl beat the eggs.
3. Add the butter or margarine to the skillet and melt.
4. Add the beaten eggs.
5. When the eggs are slightly done add the warm pork cracklins and gently fold into the eggs.
6. Once the eggs are about done add the salsa. He said his mom uses a mild homemade salsa that she canned over the summer  but a good store bought salsa would work well too. The more watery it is  the better (in this particular recipe). You want the cracklins to absorb the salsa and become moist.
7. If needed you can add a tiny bit of water just in case your salsa wasn't "watery" enough.
8. When done. Scoop the huevos con chicharrones into the tortillas and garnish with shredded cheese and additional salsa and cilantro if desired.,

2. Place all cut ingredients plus the garlic in a large heavy pot.
3. Sprinkle with salt according to your tastes add the lime juice and pour in just enough water to leave a half- to a quarter-inch of the ingredients sticking out.
4. Bring to a boil then reduce to medium-low heat and simmer uncovered for 45-60 minutes or longer.  The ingredients will break down a bit and the liquid should be reduced by a quarter to a third.
5. High elevation cooking (over 3000 feet): After boiling reduce to medium heat and cook for roughly the same amount of time.  High air pressure will tend to mean longer cooking time.
6. Remove pot from heat and let stand until a manageable temperature.  Run batches through a food processor or similar device on quick pulses just enough to break up the large pieces into edible bits.
7. Traditionally salsa is served warm at the table.  Because of the volume produced here you can refrigerate what you aren't currently eating can it in jars or freeze it in bags.  Properly canned salsa should last for three months or so in the pantry.,

14. the shuck will help you roll the masa in the way a bamboo mat helps you roll a spring roll.
15. when the tamale is rolled the shuck should be loosely wrapped about it. (the masa will expand while being steamed).
16. Tie the ends of the shuck closed and set aside.
17. repeat till all the ingredients are used.

4. Pour hot water into the roasting pan until it comes halfway up the sides of the dishes.
5. Bake the flans for 40 to 50 minutes or until they are no longer liquid feel barely firm in the center and jiggle only slightly when moved. Remove from the water bath cool and chill.
6. If you wish to turn out the flans hold a dessert plate firmly over each mold and quickly turn upside down. Drizzle the tops with the honey and garnish with the fruit.

instructions, 1. First you have to prepare the Achiote Paste. This is used to marinate the pork. First put the Annatto Powder Ground Cumin Black Pepper All-Spice seeds and whole cloves into a spice grinder. Grind into a fine dust. You wanna do that because if you don't the dust can be VERY gritty. Not good.
2. Cut up the habanero peppers. I use three. I also leave the seeds in and most of the membrane. USE GLOVES WHEN HANDLING AND CUTTING UP THE PEPPERS. I cannot stress that enough. If you use your hands to cut the peppers and then touch the seeds and membrane and then touch or scratch your face or eyes or any bit of your skin for any reason you're gonna be the sorriest person on the planet.
3. Also take the time to cut up and mince your garlic. You can use your hands to do this.
4. Pour in your orange juice white vinegar minced-up habanero add your grinded up spices (if you used a blender to grind up your spices instead of a grinder you don't have to do this) salt and garlic and then blend well for about a minute. If you think you still have some grit or pulp from your ingredients keep blending.
5. After it's well-mixed pour in a full cup of lemon juice. I like to just buy the stuff pre-squeezed. They DO sell all-natural stuff so you won't be cheating too much when you squeeze it from a bottle.
6. After that add in 2 to 3 shots of tequila. Blend again.
7. Get your pork shoulder and cut it into 1 to 1 1/2-inch cubes. Once done throw all the cut-up meat into a big 1 1/2-gallon Ziploc bag.
8. Pour the Achiote Paste you've prepared into the bag with the chopped-up pork and MAKE SURE THE BAG IS SEALED. This juice when it drips is capable of staining and leaves a pungent smell due to all the acids contained in it. Once sealed put it into the fridge and let it marinate overnight. If you don't want to wait allow two hours to marinate.
9. Next preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
10. Once properly marinated get your casserole or baking dish and line it with aluminum foil. I recommend using the wider yield because this helps prevent spillage into the dish. Once the pan is lined and you have slack foil on the sides pour in all the pork and juice and close the foil up over the meat. It wouldn't hurt to add ANOTHER layer of foil and tuck the meat in on the inside of the pan. This prevents any steam from escaping thus properly allowing the food to slow cook perfectly. Then add one more piece on top to go AROUND the outside edges of the pan.
11. Once the oven is ready put the entire dish in (make sure to handle it carefully; you don't want it to slip and fall) and shut the door.
12. Set the oven timer for 4 hours and don't look back. The meat slow-cooks on its own and you DON'T need to check on it. Doing so makes the oven lose heat.
13. During the last 30 or so minutes of the cooking prepare your rice according to the package.
14. CAREFULLY remove the dish from the oven after the timer has gone off and CAREFULLY open up the foil avoiding ANY escaping steam.
15. Use a fork to break up the steamed pork into shreds. This allows the meat to absorb a lot of the left-over juice. This also allows the pleasant side-effect of the pork tasting even BETTER the next hour and even the next day.
16. If you want to get fancy and act like you own a swank restaurant get a large lettuce leaf and then spoon out an even bed of rice on top of it. If you don't feel like using lettuce just spoon out a bed of rice on a plate.
17. Spoon out a generous amount of pork on top of the rice.
18. Garnish with a jalapeno pepper -- and enjoy. :).,

2. 2 Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Remove meat from liquid in pot (discard the liquid) and spread the meat out in a roasting pan. Break the meat into small chunks. Roast meat for 15 to 20 minutes until brown and crispy.
3. 3 If you are using store-bought tortillas heat the tortillas one-by-one either in a microwave or on a hot skillet. If you heat them on a skillet you may need to use a little butter or oil to help soften them. When air pockets form in the tortillas they are ready. To heat them in a microwave place a paper towel on the floor of the microwave. Lay one or two tortillas on the paper towel (whatever will fit so there is only one layer). Microwave on high heat for 10 seconds per tortilla (some brands of tortillas require 20 seconds each). Keep warm tortillas wrapped in a clean cloth towel for serving.
4. To serve double up the tortillas and place a few spoonfuls of the carnitas on them. Top with salsa. Serve with grated lettuce (that has been lightly salted and sprinkled with vinegar) beans avocados and/or grated cheese.
5. To eat remove half of the carnitas from one tortilla to another. Take one tortilla at a time with the carnitas and salsa fold it over and enjoy. Or keep them doubled up. Your choice.,

instructions, 1. Make the enchilada sauce: Combine chili powder flour cocoa powder oregano cumin and garlic in a small saucepan.  While whisking slowly add water one tablespoon at a time until a fairly thick paste forms.  Whisk in stock bring to boil and then lower hit and simmer for 5 minutes or until the mixture thickens.  Now whisk in the tomato sauce bring to a boil then lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes uncovered.  You can add salt at this point but if your chili powder has salt (as most do) you might want to skip it or use only a small amount.  Remove from heat and set sauce aside for now.
2. Preheat oven to 350F.
3. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat then add the onion and bell pepper.  Saute for about five minutes then add the garlic and chipotle peppers and cook for 2-3 minutes longer.
4. Stir in the black beans WITH can liquid.  Stir well.  Now add the drained corn cumin oregano and salt.  Bring to a boil then lower heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes while stirring every 10 minutes.  You want most of the flavorful can liquid to get absorbed/evaporate.
5. Once the beans & corn are done remove from heat and stir in lime juice and cilantro.
6. Finally construct your enchiladas!  Spray a 13x9inch baking dish with cooking spray.  Spread about a third of the enchilada sauce over the bottom of the dish.
7. Spoon about 1/2 cup bean & corn mixture in the middle of a tortilla. Roll up; place seam side down in baking dish.  Repeat one by one with remaining tortillas.
8. Spoon the remaining sauce over the enchiladas evenly.  Place in oven and bake for 40-45 minutes.
9. Let enchiladas cool for at least 5 minutes before eating.  Sprinkle with Cotija cheese just before serving.,

instructions, 1. Heat oil in skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and saute for a few minutes until soft.  Add ground beef and brown.  Drain fat and return skillet to heat add taco seasoning 1/4 cup salsa (you can use more salsa if you like.).
2. While the beef is cooking prepare the other ingredients:  Preheat the oven to 350*F; Grease your 9"x13" glass baking dish; cut the corn tortillas in half; and open all the canned beans.
3. After the beef is done layer the corn tortilla halves around your baking dish.  I put two on each long side one on each short side and three in the center - it is ok if there are a few gaps.  Spread the ground beef over top of the tortillas.
4. Make another layer of tortilla halves followed by the remaining salsa.  (If you want to omit most of the tomatoes you could substitute 2 sauted onions and 1/2 cup salsa on this layer.).
5. Add another layer of tortillas halves and then a layer of black beans.  I drained the beans but left a little liquid.  If you want a finer layer you can pulse them in your food processor.
6. Add another layer of tortilla halves followed by the cooking creme (see the description for a substitution.)  Sprinkle 1 1/2 cups of cheese over the cooking creme.
7. Add a final layer of tortilla halves.  Spread the refried beans over the top of the dish and coat with remaining cheese.
8. Bake at 350*F for 25-30 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly.  Allow the dish to set for 5 minutes before serving.  Serve with a large dollop of sour cream and sprinkle with diced tomato and sliced olives.
9. I serve this as a meal by itself - you could certainly add rice corn or chips as a side dish if desired.,

Also she said you could substitute regular honey or brown sugar for the chili honey if you do not have it on hand or cannot find it.

6. Take cooked spaghetti and place on platter.
7. To make this dish very kid friendly  serve the taco meat on top of the spaghetti only and have everyone choose what sides they want on their entree. If you desire to make a nice presentation add the ground beef on  top of the spaghetti then add the cheese.Then dollop or squeeze  3 table spoons of sour cream on top . Then add tomatoes and onions around the top but not over the sour cream. Sour cream can be bought in some grocery chains in squeezable bottles. If you don't have them in your area and want to try squeezing it out verses dolloping it either use a pastry bag with a fine tip or  take a quart size baggie and add sour cream. Cut a small hole on the bottom edge to create a tip and squeeze out the sour cream. It can make great thin lines all over the entree for presentation and adds good flavor.  Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Combine all ingredients in a stockpot and simmer until fork tender-this can take from 3-4 hours.
2. Can be made in a crock pot also-decrease liquid by about 1/2 bouillon powder by 1/3 and cook on low for 8-10 hours (or until tender as above).
3. When tender remove from heat and allow meat to cool in the broth until cool enough to handle (this will keep the meat moist).
4. Shred (or "pull") either with forks or by hand.
5. Place in storage container and add some of the broth to moisten; refrigerate until needed.
6. Reheat either in microwave or in saucepan; use a little of the juice to keep it moist.
7. For the Mexican-flavored pot roast don't shred-slice fairly thick (about 1/2") and make a gravy by thickening some of the juice with either cornstarch or roux (sorry you'll have to thicken by sight; tough to give an exact quantity for that); serve with plain steamed rice/boiled potatoes and a vegetable-broccoli and/or carrots come to mind first. Leftovers make great open-faced hot sandwiches.
8. For soup take broth and add some onions carrots celery an extra bit of canned diced tomato (you can use almost anything for veggies depending on what you like/have on hand) some of the pork meat and posole (or hominy); simmer until tender and add shredded cabbage; cook another 15 minutes. Serve with hot tortillas and a salad for a complete meal.
9. Can also be made as beef machaca by using bottom (outside) round chuck or brisket; replace chicken bouillon powder with beef.,

instructions, 1. In a very large (12-inch) skillet heat the olive oil over medium. Add the chile pieces and stir until fragrant about 1 minute. (Donât cook them too long as theyâll burn and taste bitter). Add the red onion and cook another minute while the onion wilts slightly. Add the balsamic vinegar sugar 1/3 cup water and 3/4 teaspoon of salt.  Simmer another minute to allow the flavors to come together.
2. Add the shrimp to the skillet with the sauce. Cook stirring until they are just barely cooked through (they will turn pink but be slightly translucent at the center) 6 to 8 minutes. Put the shrimp into a shallow serving bowl and garnish with the cilantro leaves. This dish is delicious served warm at room temperature or cool.,

instructions, 1. Prepare all vegetables and set aside in a bowl. When chopping Jalapeno peppers slice lengthwise remove seeds scrape the white stems from the core then chop into small pieces. Removing the core will reduce the heat. If you like the heat just chop the peppers and skip the coring process.
2. Spray a non-stick skillet with fat-free olive oil flavored cooking spray and brown turkey. While the turkey is browning pour 3 cans of pinto beans with the juice of 1 of the cans into a bowl and microwave on High about 4 minutes. When your turkey begins to brown add bowl of chopped vegetables (except diced tomatoes) and all seasonings except 2 tbsp of sofrito criollo. Reduce heat to Medium.
3. While your mixture continues cooking puree pinto beans in food processor with 2 tbsp sofrito criollo then pour puree into skillet stirring gently. Stir in tomatoes (drain liquid if using canned) continue cooking on medium about 10 more minutes then reduce to simmer uncovered for about 15 more minutes. Simmering will allow some of the liquids to evaporate and cause filling to thicken. Add additional seasoning or Sofrito to suit your own taste preference.
4. Serve about 2 heaping tbsp per burrito (or taco shell) topped with low fat Mexican shredded cheese mix. We use low fat whole grain tortillas. After wrapping your burritos roast at 400 in oven for about 5 minutes. Top with melted cheese and salsa and serve with a handful of tostitos. Freeze leftovers for lunches and those evenings when you don't feel like cooking. If you are making this as a party dish don't expect to have leftovers.,

2. Lay the meat out flat and season liberally with salt and pepper. Cut meat into 1/4 inch pieces. Place meat in a zip lock bag and add fine diced onions and lemon/lime juices. Mix well and refrigerate for at least 30 min. up to 24 hours.
3. Pico De Gallo:
4. Fine dice all ingredients and mix well. Cover and refrigerate stir occasionally.
5. Guacamole:
6. Place avocado meat in a bowl and mash well with a fork season to taste by adding remaining ingredients. Cover with plastic wrap pressing plastic down on the guacamole to remove any air and refrigerate. (this prevents browning).
7. Carne Asada Burritos:
8. Warm the tortillas in a microwave under a wet paper towel one at a time. (about 20-30 sec.) Or wrap tortillas in foil and place in the oven at 350 for 10-15 minute You want them warm and pliable for wrapping.
9. On high heat add a teaspoon of oil to a medium sized skillet. ( I prefer cast iron) When oil begins to smoke add 1/4 to 1/3 pound of carne asada meat and onions. Sear the meat until brown on both sides. Place the meat and onions in the center of a warm tortilla. Add pico de gallo guacamole (and french fries and/or cheeses if desired) and fold in the sides to form a burrito. Serve hot.
10. Note: Meat seems to cook best in small batches it gets chewy if cooked all at once. I cook enough for just one or two burritos at a time.,

4. Skin stem and seed poblanos. Cut into irregular 1- to 2-in. pieces.
5. On each of 4 plates arrange alternating layers of poblano pieces avocado slices and jicama; drizzle with some dressing. Add another layer of poblanos and avocados drizzle with more dressing and tuck remaining jicama slices into salads from the side. Sprinkle with cheese pumpkin seeds and radishes.
6. How to get the most from your avocado:
7. Use it when it's just ripe. How to tell? Squeeze it with your whole hand; it should have the same "give" as chilled butter.
8. Preserve the tastiest part the dark green layer under the skin. First remove the pit: Cut lengthwise around the middle to the center and twist halves apart. Thunk a chef's knife into pit and twist to pull out. To get pit off slide against inner rim of kitchen sink. If you're mashing the avocado scrape it out with a spoon. If you want beautiful perfect slices and dice score skin down center with a paring knife and carefully pull off peel.,

2. Add the can of pinto beans with their liquid.  Stir and mash (using a potato masher) for 10-15 minutes until the mixture is fairly smooth.
3. The beans might be a bit runny but once they have cooled and been reheated they will have thickened.
4. One of my daughters likes to have whole beans in her refried beans so I keep some of the whole pinto beans aside and add them the last minute or two.
5. This recipe serves 3-4 as a side dish.  If you want to make up this recipe for bean and cheese burritoes you will have to double the recipe.
6. I often like to add a little cumin powder and a dash of oregano to this recipe while the beans are cooking.,

2. Sprinkle steaks evenly with garlic and press in pequin or crushed red pepper flakes. (Pequin is intensely hot: 2 teaspoons will be fiery 1 teaspoon will get your attention 1/2 a teaspoon will still have a kick).
3. Stack steaks and let stand for about 30 minutes at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.
4. Place a large cast iron skillet over high heat until it begins to smoke.
5. While skillet is heating stack the tortillas and wrap in foil and place in the oven along with 4 to 6 dinner plates.
6. Add oil and quickly sear the meat on both sides. Add  brandy to the hot skillet. Flame the meat by touching the brandy with a lighted match and let the flames burn down. (If the flames get too high you can cover the pan with the lid.)You can do this table-side if you are careful!
7. Place all the items on the table along with the steak. Guests can pick which items to add to their tortillas. Simply fill roll and eat.,

instructions, 1. PREPARE THE MEAT: Trim the fat from the meat; cut into 2 large pieces. Put meat into a large non-corrosive baking dish or pan.
2. PREPARE THE MARINADE/GLAZE: Heat a griddle or large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Tear chiles into flat pieces and toast a few at a time pressing them against the hot surface until they crack and blister; flip them and press down again. Transfer chiles to a large bowl and cover with boiling water; weight down with a plate to keep them submerged and soak at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile roast the garlic in the same griddle or skillet turning frequently until soft inside and blackened outside about 15 minutes. Cool and peel. Drain chiles reserving 3/4 cup soaking liquid; put chiles into a blender with garlic cloves sesame seeds vinegar cumin peppercorns or ground pepper and salt. Process/blend until mixture is smooth; then strain through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl. Remove 1/2 cup of mixture to a small bowl and stir in the sugar; set aside to use for the final glazing.
3. MARINATE THE MEAT: Spread the rest of the chile paste thoroughly over the meat. Cover completely and refrigerate at least 18 hours.
4. COOK (SLOW-STEAM) THE MEAT: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Use a deep wide roasting pan that has a tight lid. Put a roasting rack into the bottom of the pan (it must sit at least 1 inch above the bottom of the pan---if not prop it up with custard cups tin cans etc.) Measure in 4 cups of water. Then lay the marinated meat onto the rack and spread any marinade remaining in the marinating pan or dish. Cut a double thickness of heavy-duty foil to cover the roasting pan; place the pan lid over making sure the pan is covered as tightly as possible. Bake 4 hours.
5. FINISHING THE BROTH: Remove the pan lid and foil; carefully remove the tender meat to a platter. Take out the rack; spoon the fat off the broth with a ladle. Measure out the broth into a 1-quart container; add water to equal 1 quart liquid if necessary and pour into a saucepan. Puree the tomato in a blender and add it to the broth along with the oregano and cinnamon. Cover; simmer over medium-low heat 45 minutes. Season with salt.
6. GLAZE THE MEAT: Heat oven to 375 degrees. Remove meat from the bones keeping pieces of meat as large as possible; discard bones gristle and excess fat. Set meat on a baking sheet; brush lightly with reserved chile paste glaze and bake 10 minutes to set the glaze.
7. TO SERVE: Keep tortillas warm in a towel-covered basket. Serve the broth in a tureen. Present the meat on a large platter or slice meat across the grain to serve it in deep plates awash in the broth. Combine onion and coriander in a small bowl to pass with the lime at the table.,

instructions, 1. Season each side of roast evenly with seasoning salt garlic powder pepper cumin and chili powder using a 1/4 teaspoons each per side.
2. Heat pressure cooker (without lid) with vegetable oil over medium-high heat.(I use an 8 quart Presto one.).
3. When hot place roast in carefully.
4. Brown each side this should take about 3-5 minutes per side depending on how hot the pot/oil is. Just brown each side nicely is all. Not a big deal! ;).
5. Add beef broth and turn heat down to medium.
6. Place on top securely place on regulator.
7. Heat til regulator starts rocking. (This takes about 10-15 minutes at most.).
8. Adjust heat til regulator is at a nice even steady rock. (If it's rocking really slow turn the heat up a TINY TAD and vice-versa.).
9. When regulator starts to rock set timer for 50 minutes.
10. After 50 minutes turn off heat and let it sit (let it drop on it's own accord) til it is cool/safe to open. Check all parts/vents to make sure before opening.
11. Remove lid. Remove beef to a plate cover with a papertowel to keep warm and moist.
12. Pour off 2 cups broth from pot into heatproof measuring cup discard excess or save for another use.
13. Put beef back into pot and add broth.
14. Shred beef with 2 forks.
15. Add 1 cup water taco seasoning packets hot sauce and butter.
16. Bring to a boil reduce heat and simmer about 15-20 minutes or til thick. Turn off heat set aside.
17. Warm tortillas in microwave (nicely separated) for about 10-20 seconds on high just til pliable.
18. THINLY spread each (one side)with refried beans then put a bit more straight across center to your liking.
19. Place thinly sliced tomatoes across center of beans overlapping. (3 to 6 THIN slices depending on the size of your tomatoes I use Romas large tomatoes may need to be halved first.).
20. Top with a nice amount of shredded lettuce keeping it all in the center straight across.
21. Pile each (on top of lettuce) with the shredded beef mixture.
22. Fold top side over covering and then bottom side over. (*You can fold outside edges over first crimping them in then do the upper and lower big sides if desired to hold everything in better but it isn't necessary just do how you like it. Either way it comes out just fine! :).
23. Turn over and place that side down into 2 13x9 pans. (Seam/folded side down tomatoes will now be the top side.).
24. In medium bowl make Colorado sauce by mixing enchilada sauce and beef gravy together well.
25. Pour evenly over burritos.
26. Totally smother both pans with cheese. This will seem like a lot but it's right on! Pile the cheese up! Not kidding! This is what really makes them "wet burritos"! :).
27. Bake in 350 oven for about 20-25 minutes or til cheese is melted but not browned.
28. Plate using large spatula! Use 2 if needed!
29. Top with whatever you like such as sour cream salsa jalapeno rings black olives etc.!
30. I like to serve this with Spanish rice and tortilla chips with the leftover refried beans and salsa!
31. *If you only want to make a few at a time don't assemble til you are going to eat them. Preheat beef mixture in microwave before assembling for even heat throughout before baking. Baking time is the same.

instructions, 1. Pick through the beans and remove any debris beans that have split or ones with holes. Throughly rinse and set aside. In a large pot heat a splash of oil once warm sautÃ© the serrano and onion just until the onion begins to brown and the chile blisterâ about 4 minutes. Next add the crushed garlic and sautÃ© until it softens careful not to burn the ingredients. Add the cleaned and rinsed beans into the pot then pour in enough water to cover the beans by 3 inches or 7.5 centimetres. Cover the pot and allow to simmer over medium heat until the beans have softened. Check on the pot now-and-then to make sure it has enough water you'll need to add a bit more water from time to time.
2. Once the beans have soften or you can squeeze it between your fingers add the epazote leaves and sea salt; I add about 1 tbsp of coarse sea salt. Allow to simmer over medium heat and uncovered for another 15 minutes. At this time the beans should be cooked through and the skins will easily slip off. Taste and adjust salt if desired. Make sure that there is plenty of broth leftover in case you want to use it for mashing or for soup/stew making. Remove onion garlic serrano pepper and epazote leaves before serving or using.,

instructions, 1. Pork:
2. trim fat from meat.  In a small bowl combine garlic coriander cumin oregano onion powder salt black pepper and red pepper.  Rub into the meat and place in a roasting pan with cover.  Roast at 325 for 2.5-3 hours or until very tender.  (I haven't tried it yet but I'd wager you could cook it in a crock pot too).
3. Remove meat from liquid and shred the pork using 2 forks.  Stir in 1/4c of liquid if desired.
4. Sour Cream Sauce:
5. Whisk it all together.
6. Now you're going to need the basics like shredded cheese lettuce salsa (I prefer the sauce) torillas etc. but these two recipes will make the best tacos you've ever eaten.,

name, Spinach and Mushroom Tamale Filling, 
cuisine, Latin American >> Mexican >> Mexican, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Begin with the spinach by washing stemming and chopping it into approximately 1/4-1/2 inch pieces.   Mince the garlic and onions; brush slice and chop the mushrooms.
2. Over medium-high heat in a *very* large pot (I use my largest Le Creuset) heat the oil.  Add the minced garlic and scallion and sautÃ© quickly stirring for about 20 seconds (careful not to burn the garlic!).
3. Quickly decrease the temperature to medium and add the sliced mushrooms and allow to sautÃ© for about 5 minutes.  Add the chopped spinach salt sugar pepper nutmeg and cinnamon.  (This step is admittedly the messiest part of making the filling because spinach is so much larger before it cooks down; I usually add it about a 1/3 at a time to the large pot stir it and wait for it to cook down a bit and add more until I've got all of it into the pot.  Cover it for about 2 minutes stir again and uncover and continue cooking.)  SautÃ© for about 10 minutes stirring frequently until tender.
4. Pour cooked mixture into a colander and allow to drain - if you like you can reserve the juices for making sauce for the tamales after they're cooked or for some other use.
5. Lower the temperature to low and add the crema and cotija and continue cooking for 5 minutes stirring so that it's mixed well and the cheeses do not scald.  Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
6. Use as filling for your tamales and enjoy!  I prefer to make a simple crema and garlic sauce for these tamales but a red sauce is also good (although it can overpower the lighter tasting tamales so you'll want to be careful).  Also although the small amount of salt might not seem like enough when reading through the recipe remember that cotija cheese is salty - it provides plenty of seasoning to the filling.,

instructions, 1. Brown pork in oil over high heat in a large pot in 2 batches. When the second batch is browned add the onions to it cook for 4 min stirring a few times to soften the onions.
2. Add back the first batch of browned meat and all the remaining ingredients up to (including) the black pepper to the pot and bring to a boil over high heat stirring often. Optional: Some people like some heat in their food my family does not. If you want a kick in this recipe dice up 2 oz of pickled jalapeno slices from a jar and add them in with the rest of the ingredients at this point. 2 oz is just a recommendation; itâs really a matter of personal preference on your part.
3. Reduce heat until you get a nice simmer and cook uncovered for 60 minutes stirring a few times. If you cook it longer the meat will get mushy so I would not recommend it.
4. Taste it now and if you feel it needs any salt or spices this is the time add them. Remember: everything that came from a can plus the chicken broth has salt in it so I did not add salt to the ingredients list.
5. To serve add chili to a bowl put a good spoonful of salsa on top of chili on one side of the bowl and do the same on the other side using sour cream. Sprinkle some cheddar or Monterey Jack on top and serve with warmed soft tortillas. Enjoy.,

cuisine, Latin American >> Mexican >> Mexican, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Using a sharp kitchen knife cut a lengthwise slit down the middle of each vanilla bean.
2. Cut vanilla beans into 1/2-3/4 inch pieces.
3. Pour vodka into your container.  If using corn syrup add and shake to dissolve syrup. Sugar can be used but is harder to dissolve.
4. Add vanilla beans to container and shake.
5. Keep vanilla extract in a cool dark place with the bottle tightly closed to prevent evaporation and loss of flavor.
6. Once each day vigorously shake the container for 30-seconds.
7. It will take at least 30 days for the vanilla extract to mature. The longer it sits the stronger it gets. I know people who make this in July and don't use until December when baking time begins and to use for gifts.
8. Shake vanilla bottle before each use.
9. As the contents of the bottle are poured out top it up occasionally with additional vodka and a bit more corn syrup; about once a year add a couple more finely chopped vanilla pods.
10. Occasionally spoon out some of the mass of vanilla pods that settle to the bottom of the jar for when you want a very intense vanilla flavor (such as homemade vanilla ice cream or butter/vanilla pretzel cookies).
11. Another thing you could do is to remove some the vanilla beans from the alcohol dry them thoroughly and place them in a canister of sugar to make vanilla sugar.
12. You may want to use one-fourth to one-third the amount called for in most recipes as this has a very strong vanilla flavor.
13. Small flecks of the vanilla pods will be in the vanilla extract - they provide additional flavor. They also appear as dark flecks in light-colored food donât shake the bottle if you donât want the flecks to appear.
14. Vanilla extract will stay fresh for two years unopened and for one year after being opened.
15. Small bottles with the vanilla beans left in them make great gifts for friends who bake. Include the basic instructions and a few extra vanilla pods in case they want to make an even stronger extract or wish to make some vanilla sugar on the side.
16. To strain and bottle for storage: Use a very fine strainer coffee filter or paper towel to strain.,

3. Rub seasoning into the meat.
4. Layer meat onions and garlic in a deep pan or bowl and cover with beer by placing portion of meat on the bottom top with onions (sliced so that it forms rings) chopped garlic then repeat until all meat is used. Fill with beer of choice until everything is covered.
5. Let sit for several hours or overnight.

2. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
3. Stir in the flour and continue stirring for 3 to 4 min or until it makes a light brown roux.
4. Add all the dry ingredients and continue to cook for 1 minute constantly stirring and blending ingredients.
5. Turn the heat to low and let sauce simmer for 15 minutes. add water to adjust the thickness.
6. Makes about two cups.
7. For the enchiladas:
8. Cut the chicken in to small pieces and cook in the pan with the oil.
9. After the chicken is cooked and cool pull in to small pieces or shred it.
10. Preheat the oven to 450.
11. Cut the block of velveeta in to strips about a 1/4 of an inch.
12. Chop up the onion.
13. Lightly coat the bottom of the pan with the gravy. I use a 4.8 Qrt Pyrex.
14. Take a tortilla and place the shredded chicken in it.  Then place some chopped onion and spoon a small amount of the gravy in side of the tortilla. Place a piece of cheese or two inside the tortilla and wrap it up.  Place it wrap side down in the pan. Repeat until you have stuffed all the tortillas inside. After you are done with that I place the rest of the cheese and onions on top of the tortillas. Then pour the rest of the gravy on the top of the tortillas.  Use all of the gravy up because this is where your flavor comes from for the meal. You can put more onion or less or more cheese.  It is all up to your taste and what you like.  I try and pack as much in side of the tortillas as I can but it is up to you.,

4. Remove the pork from the oven and reduce temperature to 250 degrees. Place the pork in a 13x9-inch heavy-duty disposable drip pan. Pour the tomatillo mixture around the pork so it comes up the sides of the pork by 1 inch or so. Seal the pan tightly with foil and place the pan in the center of the oven. Cook the pork until the internal temperature of the meat reaches 190Â°F and the meat is so tender that it tears easily with a fork 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours.

Chop the pork into 1/2-inch chunks and shreds discarding any large pieces of fat or tough pieces of meat. Pour the pan liquid into a large saucepan and spoon off most of the surface fat. Add the shredded meat and simmer the mixture uncovered for a few minutes to blend the flavors. Season with the cilantro Tabasco as well as salt and pepper to taste. The chile verde may be made up to this point 1 day ahead of serving and refrigerated overnight. Warm the chile verde over a slow simmer before serving.

2. Add minced garlic and squeeze the juice from one-half of the lime into the bowl of avocado.
3. Mash the ingredients together to desired consistency using the back of a large spoon or a potato masher (some like the avocado chunky some like it smoother).
4. Fold in diced tomato and diced onion a couple pinches of salt and the juice from the remaining lime half (Also add cilantro or peppers at this time).
5. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 30-45 minutes.
6. Uncover and taste.
7. Add salt as needed.
8. If you don't give the resulting guacamole at least 4 stars then you ain't making it right.
9. NOTE: The purpose of the lime is to allow any leftover guacamole to retain its "avocado" color as it sits in the fridge.
10. Some folks use lemon but it's been my experience that if you accidentally add too much lemon it seriously affects the guacamole's flavor; if you happen to add too much lime the guacamole just gets a little more tangy.
11. If you find the leftover guacamole has darkened simply stir it before eating and use more fresh lime juice next time.
12. Wholly guacamole may be used as a topper with tacos enchiladas fajitas etc.
13. However some say it is at its best with a bowl of warm tortilla chips and an ice cold beer.,

instructions, 1. Remove stem of ancho chilis and tear open to expose seeds and create an open and flat chili. Discard seeds.
2. Place chili one at a time SKIN side down on a SCREAMING HOT skillet or grill pan. The chili should pop and crackle a little as you press it flat and hold it against the scorching hot surface with a metal spatula while you count one cerveza two cerveza three cerveza! Remove from pan and repeat until all chilis are seared. (NOT the pequin tho!).
3. Now place the seared Ancho chilis in 1 cup VERY HOT water and weigh them down with something so they stay submersed. I use a potato masher bc it stands by itself and is easy to remove.
4. Soak chilis for about 15-20 minutes. Drain and discard soaking water.
5. Meanwhile chop dice and measure remaining ingredients.
6. In a blender combine drained chilis chili pequin tomatoes garlic 1 onion- reserve the other to add later cilantro sugar lime juice and broth or juice. Pulse until smooth. (I use what I have on hand. Try to match the broth to whatever dish you are preparing or use V8 or tomato juice.).
7. Heat oil in the skillet used previously or a heavy pot. Add celery onion and green pepper and saute until they begin to soften. (I like to keep the pieces rather large about 1 inch in size.).
8. Remove from heat and pour all ingredients from blender into hot pan. IT WILL splatter and pop! Be careful! Return to burner and whisk over high heat until the mixture comes to a boil.
9. Reduce heat immediately and continue whisking periodically for about 10 minutes or until sauce is thick.
10. Use immediately or transfer to a glass jar with tight fitting lid cool and store in refrigerator until ready to use.

6. The liquid may turn murky and brown but the solids will settle and the color will clear.
7. When the liquid is clear strain out the solids by pouring the liquid through several layers of cheesecloth.
8. Store vinegar in a clean bottle away from light.
9. NOTE:  During storage the vinegar may develop a gelatinous mass that floats or sits at the bottom of the jar.  This is called the mother of the vinegar & is harmless.  If you make another batch of vinegar you can use some of this mother to help the new batch develop.
10. UPDATE:  After making this recipe myself I want to warn that the pineapple does start releasing gasses during fermentation so keep an eye on it and loosen the lid carefully to release any pressure building up when needed.,

instructions, 1. 1. In a small bowl mix together chili powder garlic powder onion powder red pepper flakes oregano paprika cumin salt and pepper. Store in an airtight container.
2. Note:  I browned ground beef drained the fat used 3 Tbsp per pound of meat and I added 1/2 Tbsp flour to the seasoning and mixed thoroughly before dusting the meat with it. I added 2/3 cup of water mixed it up with the ground beef and let it simmer down. would be great with shredded beef or chicken too.it is def hotter than the packaged stuff so if you don't like hot would reccommend cutting the red pepper flakes. it is salty too. don't substitute sea salt for table salt. it is not an even swap. I did cut the sea salt down slightly -- I am making a huge batch of this sealing it in mason jars with my foodsaver and giving as gifts for christmas.Close lid securely and shake well to mix contents. One half cup is equivalent to 1 (1.25 ounce) package of taco seasoning.
3. I found that 2 *very* heaping tablespoons of the seasoning equals about one regular seasoning packet. My family likes things a little spicy though so two regular tablespoons would probably be sufficient. I substituted 1/8 teaspoons of cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes  (I would however suggest maybe just the 1 teaspoons of cumin). We figured out that 2 1/2 - 3 tablespoons = one 1.25 oz. packet which I will NEVER go back to!
4. Sometime I tweaked it to up the garlic and onion to a TBS each. I'm a garlic/onion lover. I added 1 tsp of cornstarch into the mix (you can use 2tsp flour as an equivalent) to help the sauce cling to the meat. Good but there was still something missing -- and I just didn't know what --  While making this I searched and found elsewhere that someone listed a beef bullion cube in their recipe. I have the concentrated "Better than Bullion" paste so I added one teaspoon of that to the beef. AAAHH! SOO GOOOD! Whichever taco seasoning recipe you use try adding the beef bullion or paste. It really ups the meaty flavor! Turns a 3 star into a 5 star! Also this recipe doesn't mention it but it's good to add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water with the mix after the beef has browned. This lets the seasoning become a clingy sauce and it all mingles happily.
5. Chili Tips:
6. "When the recipe calls for 'hot chile peppers' you're not going to find them in the market marked as such there are MANY kinds of chile peppers and the ones you choose will make your recipe more or less hot.".
7. "I blended all the wet ingredients into a dutch oven and refrigerated it for 24 hours-giving it a chance to meld."
8. "I squish stewed tomatoes thru my fingers to break them up before adding them to the pot."
9. "I would encourage everyone to check the age of the spices they're using. If they're more than a year old you probably need to pump it up a little as spices lose their punch as they age."
10. "Our family eats it with rice the first night (Friday) Saturday is 'let's be lazy day' so we eat it over hot dogs and Sunday -- can you say football and fritos and chili over cheese!"
11. Spices vs. Herbs: What's the Difference?.
12. Herbs are the leafy part of plants while spices are the dried seeds bark fruit or ground roots of a plant.
13. Dried Spices are Stronger Than Fresh:
14. If you're subbing in fresh herbs you'll have to use more. One teaspoon of dried herbs is the equivalent of one tablespoon of fresh herbs (three teaspoons).,

instructions, 1. About one hour before tear off the stems and any woody part from the dried chiles.
2. Shake out all the seeds and tear them up (like you are ripping up an evil credit card) and place them into a heatproof bowl.
3. Cover torn chiles with the 4 cups boiling water (make sure they are covered well- add more boiling water if needed).
4. Weigh the top of the chiles down with a heatproof plate (just to make sure they stay submerged).
5. Allow them to soften in the hot water for about 1 hour.
6. Using a slotted spoon remove the chiles from the water but do not discard the water (set it aside for now).
7. Place the softened chiles in a blender or food processor along with the chopped 1/2 onion salt garlic red wine vinegar and lime juice.
8. Puree mixture until smooth adding 3/4-1 cup of the reserved soaking liquid to get the consistency you like (discard any liquid you don't need or save it to cook with rice).
9. Pour pureed salsa into a bowl and stir in the minced chiles (protect your hands if you want with gloves while mincing) (use habanero jalapeno or whatever kind you like or have) and chopped cilantro.
10. If you have not protected your hands with gloves while mincing the hot chiles wash them several times with dishwashing liquid to help remove some of the volatile oils.
11. And don't rub your eyes.
12. The salsa may get hotter as it sits for awhile with those minced chiles so consider that when deciding how many chiles to use.
13. Adjust seasonings for salt (if necessary) and serve with warmed chips or over food.,

instructions, 1. Bread  --  Heat the oven to 350 degrees and either spray a cookie sheet with nonstick spray or line with parchment paper. Remove the bread loaf from the can and cut each loaf into 3 pieces.  Shape each into ball placing seam at bottom so dough is smooth on top. Place dough balls seam side down on sprayed cookie sheet. Bake at 350Â°F for 22 to 26 minutes or until golden brown.
2. Filling  --  In a large saute pan add the oil and bring to medium high heat.  Add the chicken pepper and onion and cook 5 to 7 minutes until the chicken is no longer pink.
3. Then add in all the remaining ingredients except the sour cream and the 1 cup of cheese and mix well. Bring to a boil stir and then reduce to medium low and simmer about 10 minutes add in the sour cream and cook another minute or so just to heat up.
4. Bread Bowls  --  Now the bread should be done and slightly cooled so you can handle them.  You can also make these the day before no problem. If you make the bread ahead I like to just heat them up in the oven at 325 for about 10 minutes to warm up.  Then cut a slice off the top and then scoop out about 1/2 of the bread and just press the rest of the bread in the bowl down to make room for the filling. You want some of the bread to remain.
5. Fill  --  Add 1/4 cup cheese to the bottom of each bowl then fill your bread bowl with the chicken mixture and then top each bread bowl with the remaining cheese and olives as a garnish. Serve the sour cream on the side.
6. If you really want to make it good. Place the bread bowls right under the broiler for just a minute to melt the cheese. Just ENJOY! These are really very good.
7. NOTE  --  Don't throw out that bread you scooped out.  Put in a baggie and freeze. Use that as a nice stuffing for some fish fillets of chicken breasts and it makes a great thickening agent for soups. You can also just let is dry out crunch up and use over vegetables for bread crumbs.  SAVE IT!,

2. The original recipe called for re-constituted dried onion flakes (ugh) and pickled cherry peppers which I didn't have. It also called for some sugar but the Mexican crema was perfectly sweet enough for me. Should I ever find the pickled peppers though I'd like to try adding them.,

instructions, 1. Add all ingredients to a blender and blend until very smooth it should be fairly thin.
2. Heat 2 TB oil in a large skillet(no teflon) over high heat until very hot but not smoking.  Add the contents of the blender to the skillet and "fry" the sauce stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the skillet to keep from sticking.  Be careful it makes a mess in the kitchen but it is well worth it be sure to wear your apron!  Fry the sauce for 10-15 minutes until it is reduced and the flavors have blended well.  Keep warm and use immediately or store it in the fridge for 2 days or in the freezer for two months.  If using frozen allow to thaw first and reblend quickly as it tends to separate.
3. *  Cut the tomatoes in half and grate them with your cheese grater right down to the skin.  This retains the pulp and not the skin without having to boil them.  Discard skins.  You can used canned tomatoes too if you don't have time.
4. *  Use chipotles for a nice smoky flavor.
5. *  Amount of chiles given makes a picante dish.  Omit if you don't like it spicy but I recommend at least one to give it some flair.,

4. I like to warm the tortillas in the microwave then put them in one of those handy plastic tortilla warmers. It's just better when they're warm and soft. (If you really want to go all out try making your own tortillas with masa mix. You just add water and they taste sooooo much better!).
5. Now just make an assembly line. I usually have the two sauce pans on the front burners and the rest on paper plates to the side. Pile on in this order: tortilla meat bean/corn combo sauce cheese. Repeat so you have two layers. Yummy and quick!

instructions, 1. *NOTE: Specifically Mona uses Las Palmas Red Enchilada Sauce (Medium). For a less spicy version use Las Palmas Red Enchilada Sauce (Mild). First she soaks 1 or 2 California chilies in water. (She does this for two reasons: add more flavor to the sauce and "stretches" the meal.) Drain the chilies (*saving* the soaking liquid). Remove seeds and membrane. Puree the chilies with the soaking water in a blender until smooth. Add to the canned enchilada sauce. Also you will have more sauce than is needed for the recipe. Save and freeze for later use.
2. Heat up the enchilada sauce in a non-reactive sauce pan.
3. In a large bowl combine the onion and dried Parmesan cheese. Place the cabbage in another bowl.
4. Heat up some olive oil in a skillet on medium heat.
5. Take one tortilla and [lightly] drench in the enchilada sauce. DO NOT allow the tortillas to soak in the sauce or they will fall apart.
6. Fry each tortilla for 1 minute. Flip over and cook another 30 seconds.
7. Transfer the tortilla to a plate and add a scant 1/2 tablespoon shredded cabbage (give or take). Then add a tablespoon of the cheese/onion mixture. Do not overstuff the enchiladas.
8. Roll up in a neat little bundle place seam side down and transfer to a serving platter. Repeat. Add more olive oil to skillet as needed.
9. *Transfer enchiladas to a serving platter and garnish with any remaining cheese/onion mixture.
10. Enjoy a slice of Heaven on Earth!

3. Let the vegetables cooked once cooked add fish (taken out from oven) and while mixing it smashed the fish into small pieces.
4. Now the tacos can be eating in three different ways: eat with warm corn tortilla make your own taco shell by cooking the tortilla on hot oil or buy taco shells already done. I prefer just to warn up the tortilla to make healthy conscious.
5. Place veggie/fish mix in tortilla and top with tartar sauce.,

instructions, 1. Recipe for the Cake:
2. Turn the oven to 375 degrees.
3. In a medium bowl mix all your dry ingredients together (the sifted flour sugar and baking powder).
4. Next in your standing mixer add the 6 eggs.
5. Turn the mixer on and continue until the eggs are foamy and pale yellow.
6. Little by little add your dry mix to the egg mixture. As it starts to dry up and a little bit of milk. Repeat this process until youÊ¼ve used all the milk and dry mix.
7. Pour mixture into a lightly greased 11X15 pan.
8. Bake for about 40 minutes or until fork is clean. (Do not open oven until after 30 minutes have passed or cake will sink.) (If you are using a glass pan it will cook much faster than when it's in a foil or aluminum).
9. After 30 minutes you can begin testing the cake with a knife. Once it comes out clean the cake is ready!
10. Recipe for the Tres Leches:
11. While the cake is in the oven gather your ingredients for the Tres Leches.
12. You may need to blend these ingredients in two batches because they may not all fit. Have a large bowl ready where you can combine both blender batches.
13. We filled the first blender with 1 can of condensed milk 1 can of evaporated milk half a pint of heavy cream and the vanilla extract. Blend until mixed thoroughly. Then poured the mix into a large bowl. In the second blender we combined the remaining ingredients (the rest of the heavy cream 1 can of evaporated milk 1 can of condensed milk and a shot of Bailey's).
14. Set the milk mixture aside until the cake is ready and out of the oven.
15. While the cake is still hot poke a bunch of holes with a fork and begin pouring the milk mixture onto the hot cake. Keep piercing the cake as you pour. (It helps to pour the milk mixture in a pitcher-like-container or something with a spout).
16. The finished product will look a little messy. But remember the icing is beautiful and will cover the puncture holes.
17. Set the cake aside. It needs to cool and soak up the milk.
18. Recipe for the Meringue:
19. The safest thing to do is to leave the cake in the fridge covered over night. And then make the icing right before you serve the cake.
20. First get all your ingredients ready for the icing. I would recommend using fresh egg whites (not like I did).
21. Mix the 6 egg whites in your Kitchen Aid or a hand held blender. (I have neither at my house so I got a real work out mixing those egg whites!) Mix egg whites a "punto de nieve-" It has to look thick yet ï¬uffy like fresh ice cream. In the picture below it's almost ready but not quite.
22. * Add 1/4 teaspoon of Cream of Tartar to hold the meringue if you're not serving cake right away.
23. Meanwhile add 1/2 cup of sugar into a small sauce pan.
24. Then pour just enough water to cover sugar. You may not need the entire amount but do not go over 1/2 cup if it is not covered.
25. Heat in medium-low heat and stir frequently.
26. Keep testing it by dipping a fork and lifting it up in the air. Once it is an "hiloâ or string will form as you lift the fork. Then you are ready for next step. It might take a while but it is important to get the right consistency. And you need to move quickly with this next step before sugar cools.
27. Now while the sugar is hot go back to your egg whites. Add sugar mixture a little at a time while mixing. Once it is all blended in add a little more. DonÊ¼t do it too fast or it wonÊ¼t mix right but donÊ¼t do it too slow or sugar will cool down. Keep mixing until bowl is cool.
28. Frost your cake and enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 450.
2. Cut stems off of peppers and cut them in half lengthwise.
3. Remove the seeds and veins from the peppers (you may want to wear gloves to keep the oils off of your hands).
4. When finished make sure you rinse the peppers so the oils are removed from the outside of the pepper.
5. Fill each pepper half with cream cheese. If using large peppers you may have to use more cream cheese than listed above.
6. Cut the slices of bacon to fit on top of each pepper.
7. Place on a baking sheet and sprinkle the cheddar cheese on top. If you keep them next to each other in a bunch on the cookie sheet it is easier to sprinkle the cheese on top and keep it there instead of having it fall off and burn on the cookie sheet. Just make sure you separate the cheese carefully when they are done baking and still warm.
8. Bake until bacon is fully cooked about 10-15 minutes.
9. Remove and serve when cooled. (They can be made the night before and stored in an air tight container in the fridge).,

3. To make the fish:.
4. Heat a heavy pan about 1/4 full of peanut oil to approximately 375 degrees.   Place Panko crumbs salt pepper and chipotle powder in a shallow bowl.  Wisk eggs into another shallow bowl with some salt & pepper.   Slice fish into taco size pieces about 1 inch wide by 3-4 inches long.   Dip fish into the egg wash and coat with panko crumbs.   Make sure that the fish is well coated but not over coated (shake well).   Let rest for a 2-3 minutes before cooking.
5. Cook the fish in the hot oil in small batches.  This will keep the temperature high so you can cook the fish fast.    Cook the fish for about 4-5 minutes until golden browned and crispy.  Once cooked place on paper towels and pat dry to drain any residual oil.

instructions, 1. Make the Dip and refrigerate ahead of time.
2. Mix sour cream and mayonaise together in a bowl. Mix dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Add dry spices to sour cream and mayonaise mixture stir to combine cover & refrigerate for 2 hours to allow flavors to meld.
3. Taquito instructions: Heat oil in frying pan. Add one corn tortilla and fry for just a second then turn and repeat. Place tortilla on a paper towel lined cookie sheet fitting about 6-8 per sheet. Place another papertowel over the tortillas and repeat with the rest until all are cooked. Sprinkle Salt over the tortillas as you go.
4. Once all the tortillas have been lightly fried and are soft take shredded turkey and place on tortilla in a line. Gently fold tight and place seam side down on another cookie sheet. Repeat until all the taquitos are rolled.
5. Heat an electric skillet or griddle between 300-350'  and oil surface generously. Place one taquito seam side down add another right up against it and continue until you have a row across the skillet and taquitos are secure. Continue another row if you have room (I can generally cook about 25-30 at a time) Check the first taquito by rolling or using tongs to make sure seam is secure before turning. Roll taquitos left to right and let them cook 1-2 minutes then roll again until they are secure and golden.
6. Place taquitos on platter and serve with Southwestern Dip Salsa Guacomole Sour Cream heated cheese whiz or whatever you like!,

instructions, 1. Fry the chorizo in oil until completely "browned" (good chorizo is red) and very crispy. (At this point I'd drain the oil off of it --  although Alex says that "authentically" it should be left swimming in the pan.) Keep the chorizo on heat that's just high enough to keep it hot.
2. Heat another pan over medium heat.
3. When the pan is hot place a corn tortilla in the bottom for about 15-30 seconds and then flip it and repeat this with the opposite side (15-30 seconds; then flip. This will help prevent sticking).
4. Cut a reasonable piece of Mexican cheese and place on one half of the tortilla in the hot pan. When it starts to melt spoon about a tablespoon of chorizo onto the melting cheese fold the tortilla in half and immediately remove the taco from the heat.
5. Stuff a little guacamole salsa queso blanco sour cream or whatever you prefer in the tortilla to keep it company and immediately eat.
6. These are good HOT --  so don't bother making a bunch ahead. This is the kind of food you cook for people standing around in the kitchen so they can eat it fresh.,

instructions, 1. You will also need sequins for decorating the eyes.
2. Combine the egg white and water until foamy.
3. Add extract (if using) and corn syrup.
4. Add confectioners sugar; you'll end up having to use your hands to incorporate all of it.
5. Sprinkle 1 cup of the cornstarch on a work surface and knead the sugar paste in the cornstarch until it's smooth.
6. Form a ball and wrap it up tightly in plastic wrap; chill in the refrigerator for a couple of hours.
7. Pinch off some of the sugar paste to use with food coloring for decorations.
8. With the rest of the paste you should have enough for about 8 skulls; they don't have to be very big less than the size of a small fist.
9. Sculpt the piece of sugar paste into a skull shape smoothing the surface as you go and forming eye sockets etc.
10. (You can find some really good examples on various sites on the internet--).
11. You'll find that the paste gets softer and softer the warmer it gets-- if it sticks too much add more cornstarch.
12. Add food colors (and extracts if using) to the sugar paste that you set aside; generally the brighter the colors the better.
13. If you wish you can add enough water to form more of an icing and it can be squeezed onto the skulls if not forming decorations by hand is okay too.
14. The skulls are generally"cheery" looking and colorful not particularly scary.
15. Finish by using sequins in the eye sockets.
16. Now your skull is ready to dry.
17. Simply let it sit out in a dry warm place for a few hours or up to a couple of days based on weather conditions.
18. When dry it's ready to display.,

instructions, 1. The night before or the morning before you plan to serve this mix the orange and lime juice with the achiote paste and salt in a blender until combined. Be sure to rinse the blender soon afterwards as the achiote stains. Cut the pork into chunks of about 2 inches square. Don't trim the fat as you will need it in the braising to come. You can always pick it out later. Put the pork in a non-reactive (glass stainless steel or plastic) container then pour over the marinade mixture. Mix well cover and keep in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours.
2. Cooking takes 3-4 hours so plan ahead. Preheat the oven to 325*. Line a large casserole with a double layer of heavy duty foil. Pour in the pork and marinade and close the foil tightly. Put the casserole in the oven and bake for at least 3 hours. You want it pretty much falling apart so start checking at the 3 hour mark.
3. When the pork is tender take it out of the oven and open the foil. Remove the meat with a slotted spoon to a bowl then shred it with two forks. Pour enough sauce over the meat to make it wet.
4. To serve either use this as taco meat or eat it over rice garnished with cilantro lime wedges and queso seco. Pickled red onions are a traditional garnish.,

instructions, 1. To make the beans: Put the beans in a pot along with all of the remaining ingredients and cover everything with water by 2-inches.  Bring the pot to a boil over high heat and then turn the heat down and cook at a steady simmer for about 1 1/2 hours or until the beans are very tender.  Be sure to stir the beans occasionally to ensure even cooking along the way and skim off any foam that rises to the surface.
2. Drain the beans of their cooking liquid making sure to reserve at least 1/2 cup of their flavorful broth.  Remove the pieces of bacon (you can use some of them in the dip if you want) and discard the bay leaf.  Set the beans aside to cool.
3. To make the Chipotle Bean Dip: Preheat the oven to 375Â°. Heat the olive oil in a small skillet set over medium-low heat.  When the oil is hot add the onions cover the pan and allow them to sweat for 5 minutes or so.  Remove the cover and raise the heat to medium.  Fry the onions stirring often until they are well-browned about 8 minutes.  Remove the pan from heat and allow the onions to cool a bit.
4. In the bowl of an electric food processor combine the beans the onions and their oil chipotle chiles cracked black pepper sour cream and salt.  Add in about 1/3 cup of the reserved cooking liquid at first to aid in the processing of the ingredients (you can add more later to reach your desired consistency) and process until a slightly coarse puree is reached (you do not want the mixture completely smooth).  Taste for salt and pepper and adjust as needed.  Add more bean liquid or sour cream if a thinner or creamier texture is desired.
5. Transfer the bean mixture from the bowl of the food processor to a small ovenproof baking dish.  Sprinkle on the cheese and cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. Place the dip in the oven and cook until warm throughout and the cheese is melted about 15 minutes.  If a bubbly crust is desired remove the tin foil during the last few minutes of baking and turn on the broiler to high until lightly browned.
6. Garnish with chopped cilantro or bacon crumbles and serve immediately with crispy tortilla chips.,

Begin to roll tortilla around mixture rolling away from you (try to roll as tightly as possible so that the filling doesn't fall out during frying).  Taquito should resemble a fat cigar (the sides are not folded in--they are just left open).  Pierce with a toothpick through the center of taquito to keep from unrolling.
9. Add each taquito to oil as you go or they will dry out and crack.
10. Do not crowd oil too much.  I usually cook about 6-7 at a time.
11. Feel taquitos with tongs as they cook.  When they are hard remove and drain on paper towels (about 5 minutes).  I usually line a large bowl with paper towels and drain all of the taquitos vertically so that all of the excess oil can drain out.
12. When those 12 tortillas are done heat up the remaining 12 in the same towel and repeat.  The reason I don't heat up all 24 at the same time is because the stack is so thick that the top and bottom few tortillas dry out and the middle ones are not cooked enough and will crack when you try to roll them.
13. When all of the taquitos are finished put as many as you want per serving on a plate (I usually serve 5-6 per person); top with sauce.
14. Add shredded lettuce and sliced onion.
15. Top that with a few spoonfuls of sour cream (or if you are like me more than a few).
16. Sprinkle with queso fresco.
17. Yum!,

name, Pupusas, 
cuisine, Latin American >> Mexican >> Mexican, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. A complete Salvadoran pupusas has many components.
2. 1 - Filling - Fillings will vary based on your taste but the two most popular fillings are pupusas de queso pupusas made of cheese only or pupusas revueltas pupusas made of a few different fillings.  The most common revueltas are made of beans and cheese or chicharron and cheese - see my post on making chicharrones to make this one.  My personal favorite is pupusas de queso con loroco which are pupusas filled with cheese and a type of edible green flower called loroco that is quite similar to asparagus in both look and taste.
3. 2.  Masa dough - This is the standard dough used to make corn tortillas - see my recipe for tortillas de maiz here.
4. 3 - Curtido - A mix of fermented cabage with a little bit of onion shaved carrot and hot chile peppers mixed inches  Curtido is either served on the side or put on top of the pupusa to be eaten together in same bite.
5. 4 - Salsa Roja or "Red Sauce" served on the side or poured over the curtido and pupusa to be eaten together in same bite.
6. Now for the secrets to making authentic Salvadoran pupusas! Are you ready?  Sshhh!  Don't tell anyone!
7. Make your own refried beans.  Handmade refried beans carry much more flavor and are less greasy and watery than the canned refried beans you can buy at the store.  To make your own refried beans simply prepare small Central American red beans the way you would to make arroz curtido.  When the beans are done cooking blend some of them up in a blender and cook them in a saucepan with a few tablespoons of oil over low heat for about 30-40 minutes.
8. Add butter or margarine to your Mozzarella cheese.  When you pour out the amount of mozzarella you will use add a few scoops of cold butter or margarine to it.  The butter/margarine makes the flavor pop and will prevent you from needing to grease the pupusas with oil when you cook them.  I personally use margarine because the extra oils in it create a better pupusa than butter will.
9. Only use Mozarella cheese for your cheese filling!  This is a very important secret.  Some international stores sell what they call "queso para pupusas" or "pupusas cheese".  This cheese is an imposter!  A fake I tell you run as fast as you can from it!  This cheese looks like Mozarella cheese but tastes terrible and if you read the ingredients you will find that it doesn't even contain any milk at all.  This cheese is made out of nothing but hydrogenated oils and trans fats.  This cheese is cheaper than buying real Mozarella cheese but  it destroys the taste and also destroys your health.  I have also seen a lot of videos on the web that add all sorts of other dairy products to their mozarrella filling - crema hard cheese and panella cheese are just a few I have seen.  While these videos say they are making authentic Salvadoran pupusas I can assure you that this is not an authentic pupusa and will surely not taste like one either.
10. Cook your pupusas over a gas stove or skillet not on an electric one.  The reason for this is that gas stoves and skillets can get much hotter than electric ones.  When the heat is too low you will get cracks on the outter tortilla skin of your pupusa.  You want to cook each side of the pupusa for about 30 seconds and flip on each side about three times.  Once the pupusa starts to puff up and fillings begins to ooze out of they are done cooking.
11. Directions:
12. -Prepare the re-fried beans the day before by boiling Central American small red beans until soft (takes about three hours see my post for Arroz Curtido for exact directions).
13. - Blend about half of the soft red beans in a blender and cook this puree in a skillet on low heat for 30-40 minutes.
14. -The day you make the pupusas mix all ingredients for red sauce in blender and blend until pureed.
15. -Pour red sauce into a small skillet covered with a tablespoon of oil and heat on medium-high until boiling.
16. -Once sauce boils turn off heat but leave pot on burner so sauce will be remain warm when you serve the pupusas.
17. -Prepare the tortilla dough in a bowl using directions found on my tortillas de maiz post.
18. -Place Mozzarella butter and refried beans into a bowl and mix with hands until well mixed.
19. -Turn your gas skillet to medium-high (high if have to use an electric stove) and place a pancake skillet (we are pretending this is our comal) on top of the gas burners so it can start to get hot.
20. -Wet your hands in the small bowl of water you have near you and then grab a ball of tortilla dough in your hand.
21. -Flatten the dough into a flat circle using your hands and then put about 2 small spoonfuls of the bean/cheese mix in the middle.
22. -Once you have placed filling in center of dough close the dough back up using your hands to form a ball again that surrounds and covers your filling.
23. -While reforming the ball pinch off any extra dough at the top to prevent an over-sized pupusa.  You want just enough dough to completely surround your filling and no more.
24. -Place ball of dough with filling inside between two plastic baggies flatten with a plate or your hands and then peel off flattened pupusa and place onto the hot skillet.
25. -Cook each side of the pupusa for about 30 seconds each flipping total about six times so that each side gets the heat about three times.
26. -Once the pupusa begins to puff up or fillings begin to ooze out of it and burn on surface remove the pupusa from the heat and place onto a big piece of aluminum foil.
27. -Repeat process until you have used up all your dough and filling.  If you run out of either just make more.
28. -Serve the pupusas with curtido and red sauce.

instructions, 1. MEAT:
2. Cook hamburger meat and chopped onions in a large skillet until the fat is rendered from the meat and the onions are clear. Drain ALL fat by placing meat in a colender and pressing with a spoon. Return meat and onions to skillet and add catsup Worchestershire sauce chili powder salt and pepper. Simmer very slowly for at least one hour one and a half is better. A small amount of water can be added to keep from sticking. You can also add more catsup if it is becoming too dry but the final product should be fairly firm without too much moisture. Skim any fat that still remains on top. If you cook it properly to begin with there will be very little.
3. Something magic happens when catsup (the good stuff) is cooked with chili powder. I use this in meatloaf and Bar-B-Q Sauce also with wonderful results.
4. SLAW:
5. Use a food processor to grate one medium head of cabbage. Grate the cucumber fine without peeling. Grate the onion very fine. Add the salt pepper vinegar Wesson oil and sugar. Mix together. The slaw should be made at least a day in advance and placed in a covered dish in the refrigerator. It keeps for a week and seems to get better every day. This is a great slaw to serve with any meal and has the most unusual and delicious flavor of any slaw I ever tasted.
6. It is very important to serve these on a toasted bun. Place meat on the bun bottom and drain the slaw well. Place a spoon full of well drained slaw on top of the meat and cover with the bun top. Some people like the slaw on the side.
7. The meat freezes well will keep in the cooler for a week and heats up in a microwave oven without any after-taste.
8. CAUTION: These are highly adictive! They will become a family favorite after one try. Little old ladies have been known to eat three on small buns.,

name, Tomatillo Pork Braise With Pickled Chilis (Puerco En Salsa Verde, 
cuisine, Latin American >> Mexican >> Mexican, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Scoop the tomatillos into a slow cooker and spread them in an even layer. Scatter on the garlic jalapenos and half of the cilantro. Sprinkle evenly with 1 Â½ tsp salt.
2. In a large bowl combine the pork and Worcestershire sauce mixing until the cubes are well coated. Distribute the meat over the tomatillo mixture. Cover and slow cook on high for 6 hours.
3. With a pair of tongs remove the pork to a bowl. Tip or ladle the sauce mixture into a blender and add the remaining cilantro. Cover loosely and blend until smooth; return the mixture to the slow cooker. Stir in the drained beans taste and add salt as necessary; Stir in a little water if the sauce has thickened beyond the consistency of a light cream soup. Add a little sugar if the sauce is too tart. Return the meat to the pot let everything warm through and serve.
4. Variations:
5. This dish can be cooked in a Dutch oven instead of the slow cooker. In a medium large (4 to 6 quart) heavy pot or Dutch oven layer the tomatillos flavorings and meat as described above. Cover with the sauce set the lid in place and braise in a 3000F oven for 2 Â½ to 3 hours until the pork is completely tender. Complete the dish as described above.
6. The beans can be replaced with potatoes or small sweet turnips (cut into wedges) or carrots (2 inch lengths cut into sticks). Toss them with a little salt and place them on top of the sauce ingredients before layering in the pork. Take them out with the meat while you finish the sauce.
7. Add a big handful of spinach to the blender when pureeing the sauce; a few Tbsp of Mexican Crema or heavy cream works magic on this spinach enhanced sauce. Epazote may be used in place of the cilantro.
8. This dish is perfect made with 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs. Or replace the pork shoulder with 1 inch pieces of beef chuck; double the cilantro and use 2 poblanos. The beef will benefit greatly from browning before slow cooking.
9. Either brown the cubed pork in a little oil in a single layer in a large skillet or spread it out on an oiled baking sheet (with sides) and slide it close up under a broiler. Slide the browned meat into the slow cooker.,

2. Chop the garlic and chilies in really fine pieces The finer the better. Most recipes would tell you to de-seed your peppers but not I. That's where the kick comes in.
3. Chop your onion in fine cubes. Wear your goggles if you need to.
4. Chop the tomato. Its important to remove the seeds so the guac isn't too runny.
5. Add the avocado. Here's a cool trick on how to cut it like a pro.
6. Add the sea salt. I normally add around 1 tbsp but taste test it as always.
7. Add in the lime juice and chopped cilantro last.
8. Stir! If you have a mortar & pestle that's even better.

instructions, 1. Skin tomatoes by blanching quickly in boiling water for a few seconds until skin begins to wrinkle at the top then quickly plunging into ice water to stop the cooking. This loosens the skins for easy removal.
2. Cut skinned tomatoes into quarters and scoop out seeds and any loose pulp. Dice into roughly small cutes. Toss into final serving bowl.
3. Peel and dice the white onion. Toss into serving bowl.
4. Wash and separate about 14 stalks or simply half a small bunch of fresh cilantro.  Remove tough center stems from leaves with their tiny stems. (Leave attached the tiny stems on leaves).
5. Finely mince the plucked cilantro leaves and toss into serving bowl.
6. Cut the top and stem off one fresh jalapeÃ±o and cut in half vertically. If you want to reduce the spiciness  scoop out all seeds and pale flesh until only dark green flesh remains. Toss into serving bowl after dicing fine.Be careful to wash hands after handling. Very painful if rub eyes with jalapeÃ±o on your fingers.
7. Squeeze half orangestrain to remove seeds and toss orange juice into serving bowl.Also add fresh squeezed(better) or reconstituted lime juice. ""Note: If the orange is a really sweet orange that you use for juice omit the sugar listed in the ingredients as the pico de gallo will become too sweet if you use a sweet orange AND sugar -- only use sugar to balance the dish if it is too sour.
8. Add pickled jalapeÃ±o juice from can or if low sodium omit this step).
9. After dicing and  combining all ingredients gently toss to mix and put in refrigerator to chill before serving.
10. Note: Before adjusting 'heat' (spiciness) be careful to let the pico de gallo rest in the refrigerator a while before adding more hot pepper. As pico de gallo sits the 'heat' diffuses so donât be fooled when you first taste it.  Otherwise if it sneaks up on you it can become over-hot and you have to add more tomato and other ingredients to balance it again.
11. Make any final adjustments to balance the flavors.  Also adding too much salt draws water out of the vegetables and makes the pico de gallo watery That won't hurt anything but it is not as aesthetically pleasing if too much liquid.
12. **Note: Low salt diet users omit salt and canned jalapeÃ±o juice and use fresh not canned jalapeÃ±o.
13. Makes  at least 4 cups.,

Once the cooker is up to pressure turn the heat down a bit until the stopper is rocking gently and set your timer for 10 minutes.
3. During all that waiting time chop your onion drain and rinse your hominy open your cans of green chillies and measure out your seasonings. Read a book. Watch a video on Youtube. Finish tidying up and set the table. Whatever you like just don't get out of earshot of the cooker's hiss. You want a nice gentle rocking.
4. After ten minutes at pressure take your pressure cooker off the heat douse it under cold water in your sink until the pressure is released and open the pot.
5. Add the remaining ingredients being careful not to fill above the max fill line on your cooker. (Take out some pork/stock and set aside if needed to make room for the hominy and onions.) Stir put the lid back on and bring back up to pressure (again 20-30 minutes) and again cook at gently-rocking pressure 7 minutes.
6. After 7 minutes at pressure douse cooker under cold water in your sink until the pressure is released stir and adjust any seasonings for taste (it'll be crazy hot so be careful!).
7. Serve with a sprinkling of fresh cilantro and garnish with pico de gallo avocado slices and lime wedges. Yum!,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Remove the husks then rinse the tomatillos until no longer sticky; cut into quarters.
2. In a large bowl add the tomatillos poblano peppers onion garlic chicken oil 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Toss to coat and distribute ingredients evenly onto a baking sheet. Roast for 25 to 35 minutes or until a thermometer inserted in the chicken registers 165 degrees F.

instructions, 1. In a blender combine cilantro tomatoes jalapenos juice of 1/2 a lime.Blend.
2. Add spices and salt.
3. The salsa will have a small bite from just the jalapenos I like to taste it now and then add in minced seeds for heat -- Remember to add in small amounts jalapenos add the kind of heat that sneaks up on you. Not to mention one night in the fridge with all those flavors mingling could up the heat substantially. Sometimes I use cayenne pepper to build heat bc it dosen't seem to have as strong of staying power on your tounge. Then again I'm sure others would disagree and have their own methods for building heat.
4. Last add the onions (as much to your liking) and once this is done PUT THE BLENDER AWAY otherwise you end up with spicy vegetable pulp the onions will give it texture. Sometimes I leave out the cilantro until I add the onions to give the sauce even more texture.Of course you'll want to chop the leaves a little.
5. ENJOY!,

instructions, 1. Drizzle olive oil over the onion and season with salt and pepper. A drizzle of lime juice is a nice touch as well. Wrap the onion in foil and place in chili roaster with the peppers. Roast over the fire for 10 minutes then check for doneness.
2. If you don't have a chile roaster the oven will do in a pinch.
3. When done place chilies in a plastic bag for about 10 minutes. Then peel seed and chop. Chop onion.
4. Put the cut toms in a small sauce pan and break up. I use a potato masher works well. Bring to a boil.
5. In the mean time combine vinegar water and cornstarch to make a slurry. When the toms com to a boil add chilies onion and slurry. Mix well to thicken and remove from heat.
6. Let this cool slightly before adding the cilantro. You don't want the cilantro to wilt from the heat in the mixture. (You may I don't know. It looks like cooked spinach to me and that ain't cool :>).
7. Add cilantro.,

instructions, 1. In a large stock pot (5 or 6 quart) pour just enough extra virgin olive oil to cover bottom and place over medium heat until oil starts to shimmer. Combine onions peppers & garlic with about a teaspoon of salt (to bring out the moisture) stirring constantly to prevent burning. Once onions are opaque and just starting to caramelize the peppers should be soft enough as well. Place the onion pepper & garlic mix into a bowl and set to the side.
2. Into the same stock pot put the ground beef & sausage and turn up the heat to medium-high and brown. Once all the pink is gone from the meat drain the grease. I leave about two tablespoons worth for flavor. Now it's time to put the sauteed onions pepper & garlic back into the pot along with the 3 cans of tomato sauce chili and taco mixes. Lower heat and simmer for about 10 minutes.
3. Now that the seasoned meat mix is ready we can begin to build our dish. Spray a 9âx13â casserole dish with your favorite non-stick cooking spray. Place 6 corn tostadas on the bottom of the dish. Break up one tostada and use the pieces to cover the open spaces trying to cover as much of the bottom of the dish as possible. Sprinkle some of the shredded cheese on top of the tostadas then put a layer of meat spreading it evenly until all is covered. Top the meat with enough shredded cheese to cover and then put a few cubes of the processed American cheese spread around.
4. You will repeat this process for the next layer placing another layer of tostadas on top and then cover with meat shredded cheese and a few more cubes of the processed cheese. At this point there will only be a little meat left to cover 3 tostadas so place them in the center of the dish in a line top with enough meat to cover each tostada and sprinkle the last of your shredded cheese on the top of each.
5. Place in a 350 degree pre-heated oven for about 20 minutes until the cheese is a bubbly golden brown. Serves 6 normal eaters or 4 really hungry ones. Divide up and enjoy!,

3. Grease a 9x13 pan and coat with a few tablespoons of the sauce mix.  To make the enchiladas spoon a few tablespoons of chicken mix down the center of each tortilla.  I add a T. or two of shredded cheese on top of the chicken mix.  Roll up and place in pan.  Cover each enchilada with the sauce mix and sprinkle additional cheese on top.  Bake at 350 for 30 minutes until hot and bubbly.,

4. STORING: Put into serving dish and cover with plastic wrap so that the wrap is pressed directly on top of the guacamole (eliminating air exposure) and refrigerate until ready to serve.
5. OPTIONAL PREP TIPS: Dicing Tomatoes - Half tomatoes then squeeze each half gently and use your fingers to get rid of seeds and excess juice then dice. Dicing JalapeÃ±os - Slice the jalapeÃ±o in half lengthwise and pull out seeds and membrane. Slice lengthwise into long thin strips then bunch the strips together and cut crosswise into very finely diced pieces. (Be sure to wash your hands and don't touch your eyes I learned the hard way!).,

instructions, 1. Pre-heat oven 250Â°F.
2. Wrap the tortillas in foil and place them in the oven to warm up while you prepare the rest of the meal. Or wrap them in a clean damp kitchen towel and microwave them until warm and pliable right before you're ready to eat.
3. In a large heavy-bottomed pot add about an inch and a half vegetable oil; make sure the pot is deep enough so you have a few inches between the top of the layer of oil and the edge of the pot. Heat over medium-high heat until the oil temperature reaches 375Â°F To see if it has reached the desired temperature drop a cube of bread in the oil. If it browns up by the count of 40 itâs good to go. Another way to check is to place the tip of the handle to a wood spoon in the oil if little bubbles form on the sides the oil is ready.
4. While the oil is heating up prepare the avocado sauce: in a food processor add avocados garlic sour cream zest and juice of two limes and blend until smooth.
5. For the batter for the fish combine the flour salt sugar and baking powder together in large bowl. Whisk in the beer hot sauce and sesame seeds and stir until the batter is smooth. The batter consistency should be quite thick so add the beer accordingly.
6. Season the fish with the coriander chipotle powder and salt.
7. Working in batches drop some of the seasoned fish into the bowl with the batter and coat completely. Using a fork or tongs gently remove the fish from the batter and carefully place into the hot oil. Cook fish for 4-5 minutes turning continuously until golden and crispy all over. Cook them in batches if you need to;  you don't want to overcrowd the pot. Remove pieces to a paper towel-lined platter.
8. While the fish is frying prepare the cabbage mixture: place a large skillet over high heat with two turns of the pan of vegetable oil about two tablespoons. Once hot add the shredded cabbage and sliced onions and cook for 2-3 minutes stirring frequently. Season with some salt pepper and juice of one lime.
9. Add 2-3 pieces of the fish to a tortilla then top with the avocado sauce and cabbage salad. Fold it and eat it up!,

instructions, 1. In a 1 1/2-quart glass or stainless steel bowl combine the fish lime juice and onion. Use enough juice to cover the fish and allow it to float freely; too little juice means unevenly "cooked" fish. Cover and refrigerate for about 4 hours until a cube of fish no longer looks raw when broken open. Drain in a colander.
2. In a large bowl mix together the tomatoes green chiles cilantro olives and optional olive oil. Stir in the fish and season with salt usually about 1/2 teaspoon. Add the orange juice or sugar. Cover and refrigerate if not serving immediately. Just before serving gently stir in the diced avocado.
3. MAKE AHEAD Working ahead: The fish may be marinated a day in advance; after about 4 hours when the fish is "cooked" drain it so that it will not become too tangy. For the freshest flavor add the flavorings to the fish no more than a couple of hours before serving.,

instructions, 1. For the filling: In a medium (3 to 4-quart) saucepan bring about 1 quart of water to a boil.  Add the cubed potatoes and heavily salt the water (about 2 teaspoons) Simmer until the potatoes are fully tender about 10 minutes.  Drain.
2. In a large (12-inch) heavy well-seasoned or nonstick skillet or griddle set over medium heat combine the chorizo and onion; stir regularly breaking up any clumps of sausage until the onion is soft and the sausage cooked through about 10 minutes.  If the sausage has rendered more than a light coating of fat over the bottom of the skillet pour out the excess.
3. Add the potatoes to the skillet and continue to cook over medium heat stirring regularly until the potatoes begin to brown about 8 minutes.  As the mixture cooks mash everything together a little with the back of a spoon or spatula scraping up any crusty bits of potato so that it roughly holds together (it'll look a little like hash).  Cover and keep warm over the lowest heat.
4. For the salsa: As the filling finishes cooking make the salsa: In a food processor combine the tomatillos garlic and chiles.  Pulse the machine until everything is finely chopped.  Peel and pit the avocado add the flesh to the processor and pulse until everything is well blended (the salsa will be the consistency of a light mayonnaise).  Scrape the salsa into a serving bowl taste and season with salt usually about 1/2 teaspoon.
5. Serving:  Scrape the warm chorizo filling into a serving bowl and set on the table along with the avocado salsa and a basket of steaming tortillas.
6. Note: If you are using store-bought tortillas drizzle a clean kitchen towel with 3 tablespoons water and wrap your cold tortillas in it.  Slide the package into a microwaveable plastic bag and fold the top over but don't seal it.  Microwave at 50% power for 4 minutes to create steam in the package.  Let stand for 2 or 3 minutes before serving.,

instructions, 1. Cut up your pork roast into 1 to 2 inch chunks (Don't trim the fat it will render in final part of cooking) and put it in a large pot. Add the cup of orange juice and your seasonings. Add enough water to just cover the meat (it's ok if it's not completely covered). Bring it to a simmer and let it simmer uncovered for 2 hours. I know you'll be tempted but DO NOT stir or touch the meat during these 2 hours. You should have enough water/juice in the pot that by the end of the 2 hours you will be down to about an inch or less of liquid. When you get to this point turn the heat up to medium high and chop and stir it around until the liquid evaporates and your pork is a mixture of something between chunks and shredded. I like to let it brown up a bit even. That's it you're done! The best pork ever and the flavor is simple enough that you can do pretty much anything with the meat.,

3. COOK ON HIGH for at least 45 minutes without disturbing; from that point on stir every half hour or so checking to see if the pasta is done (based on the reviews it can take anywhere between 45 minutes and two hours). When your pasta is cooked proceed to Step #4.
4. SERVE -- topped generously with green onions and crushed tortilla chips! Be sure to turn off the crockpot or switch to the warm setting so the pasta doesn't get mushy.,

instructions, 1. Mix coffee sugar and chocolate in a saucepan.  Over medium high heat bring mix to a boil making sure to dissolve all of the sugar into the liquid.
2. Then reduce to medium low or low heatâ¦ simmer just below a boil.
3. Periodically raise heat long enough for the mix to boil then reduce heat.  Stir frequently making sure to loosen all sediment especially in the "corners" of your pan.  I start at thirty minutes and let the intervals between stirring become shorter as the cooking process lengthens.  Towards the end remember that a watched pot never boils over and with as much sugar as this mix has that's a good thing.
4. Reduce liquid level until bubbles do not want to break when raised to a boil.  Droplets falling off spoon should be like thick syrup.  The mix should be reduced by approximately 50% from its original level in your pan.
5. Remove from heat.
6. About a half hour later and before liquid cools completely add vanilla to mix.
7. After liquid has cooled roughly another half hour later add vodka and mix to an even consistency.  I have found that a whisk works best.
8. You should yield about 1Â½ liters just short of filling a Â½-gallon liquor bottle.,

instructions, 1. To prepare the beans: Soak the beans overnight in water to cover by 1 inch. Drain and place in a large pot. Add the water onion and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer skimming any foam that collects on the surface; partially cover and adjust heat to maintain a slow simmer. Cook until the beans are tender 1 hour or more (cooking time will depend on the age of the beans). Season with salt and pepper and let cool in the cooking liquid. Drain when cool reserving the liquid. Discard the bay leaf and onion.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute to release its fragrance. Add the tomatoes and cook for 3 minutes to soften slightly. Add the beans and enough of the reserved cooking liquid to make them brothy. Cover and simmer gently for about 15 minutes to blend the flavors. Taste and adjust seasoning.
3. To prepare the oxtails: Preheat the oven to 325Â°. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the oxtails (in batches if necessary) season well with salt and pepper reduce heat to medium and brown well then turn and brown the second side. Transfer the oxtails to a baking dish just large enough to hold them in a single layer.
4. Pour off any fat in the skillet. Return the skillet to high heat add the water and deglaze scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to dislodge and dissolve any flavorful bits. Pour over the oxtails scatter thyme sprigs in the dish cover and bake until tender 2 1/4-2 1/2 hours.
5. To prepare the salsa verde: Combine the parsley oil anchovies capers breadcrumbs garlic and vinegar. Season with salt.
6. To serve: Divide the oxtails among warmed serving plates leaving the fat behind in the baking dish. Put a generous spoonful of salsa verde on top of the oxtails. Spoon the beans around the meat.
7. Note: Because many butcher shops don't regularly stock oxtails call a day or two ahead to guarantee availability.,

instructions, 1. In a large kettle boil the rice cinnamon and cloves in about 3 liters of water for 40 minutes or until cooked and very soft.  (If it gets too thick and sticky before cooking has finished add boiling water.).
2. Remove from stove.  Stir in all the remaining ingredients mixing well.
3. Taste to test for sweetness; this tastes sweeter warm than it will cold so allow for that.
4. Pour into individual dessert dishes or disposable cups.
5. Eat while still warm (not hot) or refrigerate and eat cold.  This dessert keeps well refrigerated for a few days though some liquid will separate out on the top after a day or two; just stir it back into the rice before eating.
6. If you have picky or allergic eaters who don't do raisins and/or coconut but you don't want to omit these ingredients just leave them out at first when you are mixing the remaining ingredients into the cooked rice.  Pour out portions for the special people then mix in the "offending" ingredients with the remaining rice and serve the rest.  If you are sure to mark which portions are "with" and which are "without" you can make everyone happy.  :-).,

2. Remove tomatillos and peppers from water; cut off stem caps from peppers but do not remove seeds (unless you're a sissy).

4. Blend in the food processor for 20-30 seconds depending upon desired consistency.
5. Taste the sauce and if necessary add more salt (pulse-mix a few times to stir in any added salt).
6. Pour into a re-sealable container or jar let it rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes then enjoy with chips or use as a condiment.
7. This sauce seems to keep well in the fridge for at least 10 days (I have never pushed it further than that but then it usually doesn't last that long anyway).
8. NOTE: After using the food processor it is sometimes best to open in a well ventilated area as the fumes from processing boiling hot peppers can take your breath away.
9. NOTE TO SISSIES: If you can't handle the heat drinking milk and/or eating a flour tortilla will provide the best relief.,

2. Separate yolks. Remove all white as possible.
3. Add evaporated and condensed milk.
4. Mix mixture with a spoon in one circular direction avoiding building of âfoamsâ in the mixture.
5. Strain the mixture into lineras with a cheesecloth to remove the excess white part of the egg.
6. Cover the lineras tightly with aluminum foil.
7. Arrange lineras in a deep aluminum pan (ones used for roasting or those used for serving in buffets will do nicely) filled with water halfway of the lineras.
8. Add more water in the middle of the cooking time if needed to prevent burning of bottom.
9. Cook in oven at 375Â°F for around 30-40 minutes. The water-bath is more like âsteam-cookingâ than baking. Insert a toothpick in the center to check if done.
