2. Place a colander inside a larger bowl. Line the colander with a few layers of cheesecloth or a cotton towel. Use a blender to blend the beans with 14 fluid ounces of water. Pour into a nonstick saucepan and bring to a boil. Stir frequently. As soon as it comes to a boil reduce the heat to low; simmer and stir for about 3 minutes.,,
3. Pour the soybean mixture into the lined colander. Gather the edges and twist the solids in a ball to wring out all of the liquid. I use a can to help press out all of the soy milk. You will need 3 cups of the soy milk (24 fluid ounces). If you don't have enough pour some more hot water over the soybean solids (okara) until you have enough.,,

Stir in the ketchup beef stock steak sauce Worcestershire sauce vinegar instant coffee brown sugar and lemon juice. Bring to a boil over medium heat and simmer stirring occasionally until the meatballs are done.,,

source, https://allrecipes.com/recipe/40322/meringue-mushrooms/, 
instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper or aluminum foil.,
2. In a large glass or metal bowl use an electric mixer to whip egg whites until foamy. Add cream of tartar salt and vanilla. Continue whipping until the whites hold soft peaks. Gradually sprinkle in the sugar so that it does not sink to the bottom and continue whipping until the mixture holds stiff shiny peaks.,,
3. Place a round tip into a pastry bag and fill the bag half way with the meringue. To pipe the mushroom caps squeeze out round mounds of meringue onto one of the prepared cookie sheets. Pull the bag off to the side to avoid making peaks on the top.  For the stems press out a tiny bit of meringue onto the other sheet then pull the bag straight up. They should resemble candy kisses. Do not worry about making all of the pieces exactly the same. The mushrooms will look more natural if the pieces are different sizes.  Dust the mushroom caps lightly with cocoa using a small sifter or strainer.,,
4. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven or until the caps are dry enough to easily remove from the cookie sheets. Set aside to cool completely. Melt the coating chocolate in a metal bowl over simmering water or in a glass bowl in the microwave stirring occasionally until smooth.,,
5. Poke a small hole in the bottom of a mushroom cap. Spread chocolate over the bottom of the cap. Dip the tip of a stem in chocolate and press lightly into the hole. When the chocolate sets they will hold together. Repeat with remaining pieces. Store at room temperature in a dry place or tin., ,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).,
2. In a large bowl toss together the pistachio nuts hazelnuts 2 teaspoons cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves and 1/2 cup sugar.,,
3. Unroll thawed phyllo pastry and cover with a damp towel to prevent drying and cracking. Brush a 10x15-inch jellyroll pan with melted butter using a pastry brush. Lay one sheet of pastry onto the buttered pan and brush with more butter. Repeat until there are 8 buttered sheets of dough stacked. Sprinkle some of the nut mixture over this layer then cover with 3 more layers of pastry each brushed with butter. Sprinkle more of the nut mixture then 3 layers of buttered pastry. Repeat this pattern until the nut mixture is gone reserving 8 layers of pastry for the top. Each time a layer of pastry is added it must be brushed with the melted butter.,,
4. Cut the pastry into strips then into diamonds. Pieces should be somewhat small because they are so sweet. At this point each piece may be studded with a whole clove. Heat the remaining melted butter until boiling and drizzle it evenly over the whole pan.,,
5. Bake in the preheated oven until evenly golden about 1 hour and 15 minutes.,,
6. While the pastry is baking combine the remaining 3 cups sugar water honey 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil then simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes. Set aside to cool.,,
7. When the pastry comes out of the oven immediately pour the syrup evenly over the entire pan. Be careful when pouring; the hot syrup may cause the butter in the pastry to boil up and splatter. Allow baklava to cool to room temperature before serving. Remove whole cloves from pieces before eating., ,

instructions, 1. Wash peel and core the quinces reserving the cores and peels. Coarsely chop the flesh and transfer the fruit to a large pan. Wrap the cores and peels in cheesecloth tie the bag with kitchen string and add it to the pan. (The peels contain most of the fruit's pectin which contributes to the firmness of the quince paste.),
2. Pour in enough water to cover the quinces and boil half-covered for 30 to 40 minutes or until the fruit is very soft. Remove the bag of peels and pass the quince flesh through a sieve or food mill. (For best results don't use a food processor as it will result in too fine a texture.) You should have about 2 1/2 pounds of fruit pulp.,,
3. Transfer the quince pulp to a saucepan and add the sugar (ideally you should add the same amount of sugar by weight as the fruit pulp). Cook and stir over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Continue cooking for about 1 1/2 hours stirring frequently with a wooden spoon until the paste becomes very thick and has a deep orange color. Draw the wooden spoon along the bottom of the saucepan: it should leave a trail and the quince mixture will stick to the spoon.,,
4. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish or line it with greased parchment paper. Transfer the quince paste to the baking dish spreading it about 1 1/2-inch thick. Smooth the top and allow it to cool.,,
5. Dry the paste on your lowest oven setting no more than 125 degrees F (52 degrees C) for about 1 1/2 hours. Allow the quince paste to cool completely before slicing. (In Europe the traditional method of drying the quince paste is to leave it in a cupboard for about 7 days. The remaining juices will continue to evaporate and render a drier paste.),,
6. Store quince paste in an airtight container in the refrigerator; the color will deepen with age., ,
