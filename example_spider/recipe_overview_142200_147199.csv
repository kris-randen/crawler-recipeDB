instructions, 1. Mix all ingredients except color either by hand or a stand mixer. Knead until smooth and gluten has developed add in water of flour as needed. Dough will be  soft and sticky as this is how rye dough feels It makes a tacky dough not like white!  This takes about 7'10 minutes. Put dough in a large lightly oiled bowl and let rise until it is puffy about 1 1/2 hours.
2. Remove divide in half. Knead the color into one half.  Roll each half into a 8x11 inch rectangle. Put one on top of the other I put the lighter one on the bottom so the lighter color is the outside of the finished loaf. You of course can decide for yourself!  Roll into a loaf jelly roll style starting with the 8' side tuck ends inches.
3. You can either make a free form loaf and put on a parchment lined sheet pan or use a large lightly oiled bread pan. In either case cover with a  damp towel or a piece of lightly spayed cling film. Let rise until doubled approximately 1-11/2. In the meantime preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
4. Place the bread in bake for 15 minutes reduce heat to 350 and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes until it has an internal temperature of 190 F or sounds hollow when tapped.  Remove and cool completely on a wire rack.
5. You can easily omit the dry milk it is only there for nutrition and it makes for a more tender crumb. Also the coffee is only to darken one half so you get the different colors. You can't taste it! Some recipes call for cocoawhich I think you can taste others for caramel coloring. I simply think instant coffee is easier.,

instructions, 1. Shred cheese coarsely but with short strokes (we use muenster because it is so cheap and yummy and it is extremely moist but you can use any other cheese of similar consistency. Don't use a cheese like parmesan or romano because the spread won't have the right texture.
2. Combine mayonnaise sour cream (you can also use low-fat yogurt in place of sour cream to save a few calories) and shredded cheese.
3. Use a garlic press to mince the garlic directly over cheese mixture (you should use a garlic press because it will evenly distribute the juice of the garlic).
4. If you crush it on a cutting board you will lose all the juice and your spread won't have the right flavor.
5. Feel free to add additional cloves of garlic if you can handle it.
6. My wife and I haven't been able to make it past five.
7. Mix well and serve.

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
2. Cut the top of the core out of the head of cabbage. Stick a fork into the core. Set head of cabbage in a large pan of water and boil for a few minutes until the leaves become loose.
3. While the cabbage is boiling prepare the meat mixture in a large bowl. Combine the beef pork rice onion eggs salt pepper and garlic powder. Mix well (I usually use my hands to knead it all together).
4. Remove leaves of cabbage as they loosen from the head with tongs to a colander. You may wish to rinse the leaves with some cold water so it's easier to work with them.
5. Next fill each leaf to make rolls:.
6. Cut the bacon down the middle using kitchen shears. Place 1-2 half strips of bacon into the bottom of the cabbage leaf near the core end. Next put 3 or so tablespoons or sauerkraut on top of the bacon. After that put a handful of meat mixture on top of the sauerkraut. How much meat mixture you use depends on how large your cabbage leaves are. You can adjust the amount of meat mixture according to how easy or difficult it is to roll up the leaf. Wrap the core side up and over the mixture ingredients tuck it under tightly fold the sides in and roll the rest. This may take a few tries to get but fairly easy to get the hang of.
7. As you fill your cabbage leaves set them in a row in a large roasting pan. Repeat the rolling process until you have run out of meat mixture or cabbage leaves whichever comes sooner. I have found that with this recipe I usually have enough for 12 large rolls with some filling left over depending on how big the cabbage leaves are.
8. After you have filled your roasting pan with rolls put the remaining bacon strips on top of the rolls and top with whatever sauerkraut you have left. Fill the pan with sauerkraut juice until it comes at least half-way up the sides of the pan.
9. Cover the pan with tinfoil and bake for 2-3 hours.
10. Serve with crusty bread.,

instructions, 1. Combine all dough ingredients in a large bowl. You can either stir by hand or use a Kitchenaid Mixer with a dough hook. Thoroughly combine. This dough will be sticky. If it is too sticky add a little more flour and stir. Once the dough is right cover and refrigerate overnight.
2. Pears must be prepared right before you plan to assemble the strudels. Take the dough out of the refrigerator before you begin the pears. Peel and core the pears. You can soak them in water with lemon juice to keep them from browning too much until you shred them. Using a food processor with the shredder blade in it shred all the pears. Put shredded pears in a strainer and get as much juice out as you can. (You can reserve the juice for other recipes if desired).
3. Put everything in separate bowls in the area you will be working. Also have a bowl of flour available as you will need it when rolling out the dough. Using a knife cut the dough in the bowl into 8 wedges as you would a pie.
4. Flour your work area your hands and your rolling pin. Form your dough wedge into a ball. Dough will be sticky so add flour as needed. Roll dough out into as round of a shape as you can about 1/8 of an inch thick.
5. Brush on melted butter leaving an inch border. Sprinkle with vanilla wafer crumbs then sprinkle coconut nuts and raisens Sprinkle on a layer of pears. Sprinkle pears with cinnamon and sugar. All ingredients should be in thin layers and an inch border should be left bare. If you add too much you can tear your dough or it can break open while baking.
6. Fold the inch of bear dough over the topping all the way around. Starting at one end roll the dough up leaving the seam side down. Tuck the ends under so the filling does not come out. Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray with cooking spray. Repeat 7 more times. Bake at 350 for 35-40 minutes.
7. I bake 2 at a time. When they are done brush them with melted margarine and sprinkle the top with sugar.
8. You can also bake them partially about 30 minutes let them cool wrap them in foil and freeze them. If freezing them only brush top with margarine do not sprinkle with sugar. 8 strudels are a lot to eat at one time so I always freeze some for later. When you want to eat them let it thaw completely and bake for about 20 minutes at 350 until golden brown. Brush with margarine and sprinkle with sugar.,

cuisine, North American >> Canadian >> Canadian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. In a big bowl cut the butter into 1" cubes add the brown sugar and start mixing by crushing the cubes into the sugar with a fork.
2. Then work the mixture with a wooden spoon. The butter must not become warm enough so that the liquid comes out but the result has to be creamy and smooth.
3. Add the egg and mix with the spoon until well blended. Then add the water and vanilla the same way.
4. In a small bowl whisk the flour the cinnamon the soda and the salt together. Add to the butter and sugar mixture and mix with the spoon until it becomes thick.
5. Add the oats mix well and then also incorporate the chocolate cranberries and almonds.
6. Let the batter sit on the counter for 30 minutes so the oats absorb the liquid. Meanwhile put your oven rack in the middle preheat the oven to 350°F and grease your cookie sheets.
7. Using your food scale measure 1 oz portions of dough and roll them into balls. (If you don't have a scale a 1/8 cup measure can do.) Put the balls on the cookie sheets 2-3" apart and flatten them a little.
8. Cook for 12 minutes (until golden) or longer to make them crispier (a bit browned perhaps 15 minutes). Take out of the oven let sit 3-5 minutes on the sheet lift them carefully with a spatula and let them cool on a cookie rack.
9. Store in a container with a lid layers separated by a sheet of waxed paper.
10. SUGGESTIONS AND TIPS : You can use old-fashioned oats semisweet chocolate chips raisins and walnuts instead. This recipe can be made gluten-free by using GF oats and replacing the flour weight by weight with your favourite GF flour. But don't replace the butter with margarine because it will make the cookies spread out. Or perhaps you could if you reduced the amount of water I'm not sure. Also the texture will change greatly while they cool so don't panic with the initial softness!,

instructions, 1. Place the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer that has been fitted with the paddle attachment (you can also use a hand mixer or do it by hand).  Add the golden syrup salt vanilla seeds (if you're using) and vanilla extract.  Mix to combine scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure everything is mixed well.  Slowly add the powdered sugar and mix until completely smooth.
2. Eyeball a third of the mixture and place it into a small bowl.  Add enough food coloring until it's as yellow as you want it.  Then cover both bowls with plastic wrap and freeze for at least 15 minutes as you want everything to be really cold while you work with it.
3. Working quickly take about ½ teaspoon of the yellow mixture and roll it into a ball.  Repeat with the rest of the mixture.  Once the yolks are complete place them on a plate or a sheet tray covered with parchment and then put that back into the freezer.
4. Now scoop out a tablespoon of your “whites” and roll it into a ball.  Repeat with the rest.  No worries if the whites are too soft to work with -- just put them back into the freezer for a few minutes.
5. When the yolks are chilled place a white in the palm of your hand and gently flatten it a bit.  Create an indent in the center to rest the yolk inches  Place a yolk in the center of the white then cover it up and roll the white into an egg shape.  Continue this process until all your eggs are complete.  Return them to the freezer one more time.
6. While your eggs are chilling melt your chocolate.  You can microwave it in 30 second intervals stirring very well in between. (If you do this add a tablespoon of canola oil to the melted chocolate and stir well; this will give you a little more flexibility with your chocolate.).
7. Then dip: working with one egg at a time remove the egg from the freezer and stick a toothpick in it.  Dip the egg into the chocolate and let the excess chocolate drip off.  Place the other end of the toothpick into something – potatoes work well for this – while the chocolate sets.
8. Put the eggs in the fridge for only 10 minutes to let the chocolate set.  Remove the toothpick from the egg and cover up the hole with more chocolate.,

2. Crumb Mixture: Sift flour baking soda and salt rub in butter add sugar and oatmeal mix well spread 1/2 of the crumb mixture in a greased pan and press in smoothly. Cover with cooled date mixture evenly then cover with the remaining crumb mixture pat to make smooth bake 30 - 35 minutes in a cool oven 325 Fahrenheit then increase the heat to 350 Fahrenheit to lightly brown cake.
3. Cut in squares while hot allow to cool in pan.
4. Note: Date mixture can be cut in half if you do not want that much filling. Crumb mixture I blend the butter  well with the crumb mixture then I put the mixture in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer on the lowest setting for about 3 minutes until well blended to crumb consistency only do not over blend in mixer it will happen quickly about 1 - 3 minutes depending on how soft your butter is in the beginning.
5. Note: I use cold butter for the crumble mixture. We like like this date crumble very delicately browned so we don't turn the oven up to 350 Fahrenheit just keep it at 325 for 10 more minutes after the 30 minutes. I also add quite a bit more lemon and just about a 1/4 cup of dates more that are chopped and pitted that's how our family likes this cake. I also let the date mixture marry for a couple of days in the refrigerator and then reduce it somewhat on very low heat then cool for baking the cake.,

instructions, 1. 1. In a large bowl combine cabbage red apple green apple carrot red bell pepper and green onions. In a small bowl mix together mayonnaise brown sugar and lemon juice. Pour dressing over salad.
2. My Note:   You don't care for bell pepper and onions in our slaw so I left them out and it was still scrumptious. Here is a little tip I heard about from a chef on the cable food network. As you know all veggies have quite a bit of water so if you but the cabbage in a colander and sprinkle a little salt over it. It will remove the excess water from the cabbage. This process takes about 30 minutes to an hour but it gives you a very crisp cabbage and the slaw is not watery. I did differently was to put a tablespoon of lemon juice on the apples while I chopped up the rest of the ingriedients I did this the first time I made the salad I didn't do it the second time and the apples turned brown after 2 days. I still added the lemon juice that the recipe calls for.
3. For a change of pace I occasionally throw in pecans or sunflower seeds for a little something different --  This has joined a list of favorites in our household!  I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and added a couple Tbl. of cider vinegar in addition to the lemon juice.
4. I always buy a pre-shredded cabbage/carrot mixture to make prep easier and also change up the apples from time to time (try Fuji or Gala you must keep the granny smith though for the tartness). I skip the red pepper and sometimes add a little extra dressing. This is WONDERFUL and keeps for several days.,

Place cabbage into a deep pot and pour boiling water into the core covering the cabbage. Bring water to boil and allow cabbage to wilt. Separate leaves off the cabbage.  Be careful not to cook cabbage completely as the leaves will be too soft to work. Remove from water and cut large leaves in two by slicing down the spine of the leaf cutting out the hard spine.
3. Using your hands form a fat roll of meat in your palm. It should be the length of your hand as this size fits well into the cabbage leaf. Place in cabbage leaf and roll leaf around meat. Place in Pyrex 9x11-inch pan with leaf edge on bottom. Continue until you have used all the meat.

The plate will keep the fruit submerged.  It will discolour if allowed to surface.
2. Sprinkle 1 lb or 4 cups of any prepared fruit with 1 cup of sugar.  Let stand at room temperature until the fruit becomes juicy about 1 hour. Stir gently to dissolve the sugar.  Add 1 cup white rum or brandy.
3. Repeat the procedure with any additon of fruit.  Maintain the liquid level and stir occasionally but very gently.  Store the rum pot in a cool place or in the refrigerator.  Two months after the last fruit addition the rum pot is ready to be served.  It brings a bit of summer to a cold winter day.,

instructions, 1. Combine 3 cups of the flour along with the sugar instant yeast and salt in a large bowl or in the bowl of a large electric mixer that uses a dough hook.
2. Add the melted butter and warm milk.
3. Using a wooden spoon or the regular paddle of your electric mixer beat for 4-5 minutes until the mixture is smooth with no lumps. If using an electric mixer switch to the dough hook at this point and begin to slowly incorporate the remaining 2 cups of flour. If not using an electric mixer keep mixing in the flour gradually until a soft dough forms that leaves the sides of the bowl.
4. Turn the dough out onto the countertop or bread board to knead. You may need to use a little less or a little more flour this is not uncommon. Knead the dough for an additional 10 minutes either in the electric mixer or on a bread board or countertop.
5. Cover dough and leave to rest and rise for one hour.
6. Punch the dough down and knead it for a few minutes by hand before letting it rest for another 10 minutes.
7. Grease 2 medium loaf pans. Divide the dough into 6 equal portions forming each division into a ball. Place 3 balls of dough in each loaf pan.
8. Cover with a clean tea towel and allow the dough to rise until it is about 2 inches above the rim of the pan about 2 hours depending on room temperature.
9. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-40 minutes depending on the size of the pans that you are using.
10. When baked turn loaves out onto a wire rack to cool. Brush the tops with melted butter if desired to soften the top crust.,

instructions, 1. Take a small to medium onion and cut the top off (about 1/4th of the onion).
2. Peel away the outer skin but leave the root on.
3. With a knife cut wedge shapes in it.
4. But here's the trick --  take two wooden cooking spoons and rest the onion between them root down.
5. Now slice wedges into the onion as you would cut a pizza.
6. Doing this keeps the onion together at the base therefore allowing a bloomin onion result.
7. Gently (with a knife) separate the sections from one another.
8. Fry each one for a minute or so (depends on the size of the onion).
9. These small onions will open up quickly and cook quickly so please understand this takes a little practice.
10. Once its bloomin take it out of the grease and season it lightly with creole seasoning or cajun spice.
11. You could also add remolade or rosette sauce on top to finish it.
12. Variation: You can also batter them by mixing 1 cup of Bisquick and 1/2 cup of cornstarch in 2 cups of milk.
13. Make a paste first with a little milk before adding all the milk.
14. Soak the onions for about 30 minutes then dust them with flour and seasoning.
15. Open the onion a little as you do it.
16. Let the onions sit at least 5 minutes before frying.,

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat oven to 400*F.
2. 2. Season ribs with salt and pepper. Place in a shallow baking pan. Brown in oven 15 minutes. Turn over and brown another 15 minutes; drain fat.
3. 3. In a medium bowl mix together the ketchup chili sauce brown sugar vinegar oregano Worcestershire sauce hot sauce and salt and pepper. Place ribs in slow cooker. Pour sauce over ribs and turn to coat.
4. 4. Cover and cook on Low 6 to 8 hours or until ribs are tender.
5. My Note:    The genius of this recipe is the first step - roasting ribs in the oven. This removes fat and liquid that would otherwise cause soupy results in the crockpot. Use any sauce (I like 1 Cup ketchup 1 Cup Stubb's barbecue sauce 2 Tablespoons. brown sugar 1 teaspoon Worcestershire and Tabasco hot sauce to taste.) The original sauce recipe (which I've tried) isn't sharp or hot enough for our tastes. We use boneless beef chuck country ribs 2 lbs. or more. Stir once during cooking time so ribs don't stick to sides and burn. To thicken sauce a bit put the crockpot on High with the lid ajar during the last half hour.
6. I didn't care for all the ingredients needed for the results. It tasted similar to what I tend to do for slow cooker ribs. I simplyt seasoned the ribs with garlic salt onion powder and black pepper; place in the crock pot and cover the ribs with a half a bottle of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce. I let the ribs cook on low for about 8-10 hours. Then I place them in the oven on a baking sheet for a half hour so that the sauce caramelizes onto the meat. It works every time!
7. The sauce tastes alot like ketchup. It is not horrible but it is below average to me. I substituted the 2 cup equivalent of my favorite BBQ sauce for the ketchup and they were delicious. I would also recommend rotating the ribs halfway through the cooking process if possible so that all the ribs are equally tender. This just became my favorite slow cooker recipe.
8. These were the most incredible ribs I have ever tasted in or out of a restaraunt! I followed other reviewers' advice and substituted bbq sauce for the ketchup (2 cups) and ketchup for the chili sauce. (1 cup) I cut back on the vinegar to 2 1/2 tablespoons just because I thought 4 tablespoons was a lot. I also left out the hot sauce simply because I didn't have any on hand. I used boneless Country Style Ribs. I couldn't get them out of the crock pot in one piece they were soo tender!
9. In My son Note's: He said for the crock pot suggestion. Best prep is simmering ribs in water bath (with minced garlic seasoned salt & Emeril's southwestern spice) for 20 minutes; then prepare BBQ sauce of choice (approx 2 cups) add to drained ribs and cook in crock pot for 5-6 hours on low. Remove from crock pot and brown ribs on grill or under broiler.,

instructions, 1. Mix all ingredients together and cover and let sit AT LEAST 1 hour if not longer the longer is sits the fluffier it will be. When you mix it together there might be a little flour left and slightly sticky that is okay. This is the type of fried bread you will be picking up to shape.
2. After it sits heat up some oil for deep-fat frying I use a deep-fryer at home too. You can use a skillet filled with about 1 inch of oil. Heat until 375 F or a small piece bubbles and browns in a couple minutes. When ready to fry oil your hands and counter top. Divide dough into 3-4 pieces When you cup your hands together like you are holding something you don't want to get away that is the amount of dough you want. Then pat it out to just a little bigger then your whole hand and put into the oil. Fry on one side until nice and golden brown it can be a couple minutes to 5 minutes depending on what you are using a frying pan will take less time and a deep fryer will take longer but is more safe way of frying. When golden using tongs flip over and fry on the other side until nice and golden.
3. Take out and drain on paper towel and eat with butter and jam serve as a side bread or top with chili cheese lettuce and tomato for Indian Tacos.
4. I use oil to shape because it helps the dough not to stick to your hands and it keeps your oil cleaner because you won't have flour coming off the fried bread and falling to the bottom. At home I usually make it to serve with chili or soup and the rare occasions we eat it for breakfast. We try not to eat it too often because we will get fat hahaha.,

instructions, 1. Ok you get the whole story!
2. "Before beginning the adventure with puff paste there is one thing to be explained that will make its compositions comparatively easy.
3. (Ha Ha!) The butter used must be washed.
4. The purpose of washing it is to make it elastic.
5. It should be soft through being kneaded but in no sense soft through being melted- quite the contrary it must be soft and cold at the same time.
6. In winter turn on the cold water faucet.
7. Manipulate the butter with the hands under the stream of cold water until it is creamy and waxy.
8. At other seasons do this in a quart of ice water placed in a bowl of ice.
9. The butter may be kneaded with a spoon if preferred.
10. The final kneading of the butter is done on a board or it is patted briskly in the hands until no water flies.
11. This is the recipe of a professional cook.
12. As it calls for egg yolks it differs from the orthodox rule for puff paste.
13. However her results are remarkable and her method is simple so I am giving it in preference to the usual rather complicated recipes.
14. (Ha Ha again it is complicated!) She stresses 2 points: Keep the hands the bowl the board and the rolling pin as cold as possible.
15. (Ha Ha your hands will be frostbitten!) A cold windy day is best for making puff paste.
16. "Work with handsas in the first paragraph under water 1 cup of butter.
17. Place 1/4 cup butter in a cold bowl.
18. Form the remainder into a square and place it where it will keep cold.
19. Add to the butter in the bowl the flour and salt work these ingredients with a pastry blender 2 knives or the finger tips.
20. Beat and add 1/4 cup ice water and 2 egg yolks (the yolks may be omitted in that case use in all 6 tablespoons of water).
21. Work these ingredients well with the hands.
22. If necessary add to loosen the dough from the bowl a pinch of flour.
23. Place the dough were it will be cold but will not freeze preferably in the open air.
24. If it is not possible to do this fold the dough in a clean cloth and place it in a dripping pan that has been placed between 2 dripping pans filled with ice.
25. After 15 minutes roll the dough into a square on a floured board.
26. Roll it one way only not back and forth.
27. A good way is out from the centre.
28. Put the square of butter in the centre of the dough and fold the 4 corners to the centre completely covering the butter.
29. Permit the dough to stand on a cloth or piece of waxed paper in a cold place for 1/2 hour.
30. Turn it once to keep it from becoming dry.
31. Roll out the dough again into a square and fold the corners to the centre.
32. Permit it to stand again for 1/2 hour.
33. Repeat this process.
34. The dough must be chilled and rolled at least 4 times in all.
35. Chill the dough until you are ready to use it.
36. Wrapped in waxed paper it may be kept in the refrigerator for several days.
37. Roll it cut it into shapes.
38. Chill it again and bake it.
39. One of the secrets of success of puff paste is to have it ice cold when placed in a hot oven.
40. The matter of baking puff paste is a moot point.
41. In all rules the very cold paste is put into a very hot oven- 500°F.
42. In some it is baked at this temperature throughout.
43. In this case the pastry is covered with waxed paper after 10 minutes baking.
44. In other rules the heat is reduced 50 degrees every 5 minutes until the temperature is 350°F for final baking.
45. GOOD LUCK!,

instructions, 1. In a heavy saucepan over medium heat whisk together the first four ingredients milk to salt and cook stirring constantly until thickened. Turn off heat.
2. Using a small ladle or spoon add about 2 tablespoons of the milk mixture into beaten egg whisking egg mixture constantly as the hot liquid is added to prevent the egg from clumping up. I do this a dribble at a time.
3. Whisking milk mixture constantly pour egg mixture back into the pot in a very slow thin stream. When egg is completely whisked in turn heat back on to medium.
4. Whisking constantly cook egg mixture for just two minutes then turn off heat and remove pot from burner.
5. Place the chocolate peanut butter in a small bowl and whisk about half the milk mixture in and combine well then add this mixture back into the pot combining all well. Scrape into a bowl (it will be thick) cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely cold (about 3 hours should do it).
6. After mixture is cold remove from fridge and whisk in the light cream. The peanut butter mixture will be very stiff so it's slow-going at first but bear with it as it will all come together. Once the peanut butter mixture is completely combined with the light cream whisk in the heavy cream and the vanilla.
7. Prepare ice cream according to the directions that came with your ice cream maker; I let my Cuisinart ice cream maker run for about 25 minutes and that worked well.
8. Freeze for several hours to harden. This mixture yields slightly less than one quart.,

instructions, 1. Cake:
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
3. Grease a 9 x 13-inch cake pan.
4. Yield will be 50 small bar size squares.
5. Beat the three eggs for 5 minutes until thick.
6. Add the one cup of white sugar gradually.
7. Beat well and until thick.
8. Add the water and maple flavouring.
9. Add the dry ingredients in well.
10. Pour this sponge cake batter into prepared pan.
11. Bake for about 35 minutes until tester comes away clean.
12. This is a sponge cake so it only rises so high and sometimes cooks faster then stated.
13. When done remove and cool.
14. Cut into about 50 small bars.
15. Cream:
16. In a cup mix the cornstarch and milk until dissolved.
17. In a small pot over medium heat place the evaporated milk and sugar.
18. Bring the milk/sugar to a low boil; add the cornstarch/milk dissolved thickener.
19. Stir and cook until thick.
20. Remove and chill completely so that it is cold.
21. Cream the butter and vanilla (or flavour of choice) until smooth and doubled.
22. Beat in the cold cornstarch mixture.
23. Continue to beat until thick and creamy and you start eating it straight from the bowl.
24. Now the highlights of this recipe are:
25. Take each bar one at a time and coat all four sides with the frosting.
26. Yes this is a little messy.
27. Don't lick your fingers.
28. After each is coated roll onto a coconut lined sheet and cover all four sides with coconut.
29. I use small flaked coconut and toast it just slightly; dessicated coconut is too fine; shredded coconut is too big.
30. It's nice to have some one helping you do the coating in toasted coconut as your fingers will be messy with the cream.
31. If you are doing this yourself create a system to make it the easiest without being too messy.
32. You do not have to worry about finger prints in the cream as it will be covered with coconut.
33. Coating can also be peanuts or pecans finely chopped but I prefer the coconut.
34. Also you can make these small or big to the size you like.
35. Freezes well and tastes great bite size right from the freezer.
36. Simple and not a sweet bar but nice and are always the first to go.,

name, Rescued Turkey Stock, 
cuisine, North American >> Canadian >> Canadian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. First you need a turkey carcass stripped of all its meat; if you're lucky you'll be at someone's home and they'll be throwing it away-- that's the time to shout I'll take it!
2. You will also likely discover that you'll be able to rescue a lot of meat off the carcass; this is a bonus since you now have the meat for the soup as well.
3. Try to make the stock the day after the turkey was cooked but if you have to wait another day or so that's okay; it'll taste best though if you can get to it soon.
4. Let's get started; first get out a large pot.
5. Next start to strip off any meat clinging to the carcass; put this in a container and set aside; note that this is a hands-on job and you will get a little messy; that's okay both your hands and your counter wash up easily.
6. As you are stripping off the meat (don't fret you won't get it ALL some stubbornly clings to the bones and that's okay it too flavours the stock) continue to break up the bones and put them in the pot; also put in the pot any turkey skin and all the other assorted"bits" that aren't edible meat.
7. When you have the pot full of bones pour the cold water over and turn heat to high; bring to a boil.
8. Now wash up and prepare the veggies and parsley; make sure to leave the onion skin ON as it gives your stock a lovely rich colour.
9. When the stock comes to a boil add all remaining ingredients and turn heat down to a lightly bubbling simmer the type where the bubbles barely break the surface.
10. Now let it simmer for 3 to 4 hours stirring every once in a while.
11. I much prefer letting it reduce down to where I'll only get 7 or 8 cups of stock; I find the flavour much better and stronger even if I have to add water when making the soup.
12. If you only let it simmer till you have about 12 cups of stock it will be ready sooner but the flavour is much weaker.
13. Once you feel your stock is ready strain it through a fine-meshed sieve into a large bowl; if your sieve is not fine line it first with cheesecloth; discard the bones and veggies you used to make the stock all their goodness is now in your stock.
14. Refrigerate stock covered for several hours or preferably overnight; then you can either make soup the next day or freeze the stock; make sure you skim off the solidified fat before you either make soup or freeze the stock.,

instructions, 1. 1. Place a greased 10-in. springform pan on a double thickness of heavy-duty foil (about 18 inches square). Securely wrap foil around pan.
2. 2. In a small bowl combine the cookie crumbs pecans and butter. Press onto the bottom of prepared pan. Place on a baking sheet. Bake at 350*F. for 8-10 minutes or until set. Cool on a wire rack.
3. 3. For filling in a large bowl beat 1 package of cream cheese 1/2 cup sugar and cornstarch until smooth about 2 minutes. Beat in remaining cream cheese one package at a time until smooth. Add remaining sugar and vanilla. Add eggs; beat on low speed just until combined.
4. 4. Place 2 cups filling in a small bowl; stir in the pumpkin cinnamon and nutmeg. Remove 3/4 cup pumpkin filling; set aside. Pour remaining pumpkin filling over crust; top with remaining plain  filling. Cut through with a knife to swirl. Drop reserved pumpkin filling by spoonfuls over cheesecake; cut through with a knife to swirl.
5. 5. Place springform pan in a large baking pan; add 1 inches of hot water to larger pan. Bake at 350*F. for 55-65 minutes or until center is just set and top appears dull. Remove springform pan from water bath. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around edge of pan to loosen; cool 1 hour longer. Refrigerate overnight.
6. 6. Garnish with chocolate syrup caramel sauce whipped topping and additional crushed gingersnaps if desired.
7. My Note:   I would use a 10" pan next time -- too much for a 9". I had too cook an additional 20 minutes to get it to set correctly. I also use graham cracker crust because I didn't have ginger snaps on hand.
8. My sister made this cheesecake (I sent her the recipe) and it turned out SO yummy! She reserved some of the gingersnaps and crumbled them over the top upon serving (under the whipped cream). Definitely one of our new favorites :).
9. This was a hit with my extended family. I made a small portion in an additional container without crust for my gluten-free cousin she loved it.
10. One of my grandkid made this cheesecake for a family gathering and everyone thought it was very good. I personally was hoping for a little more pumpkin flavor. She only use one cup of pumpkin for 4 pks of cream cheese so the pumpkin falvor isn't very bold. Also she found this needed more baking time. She put it in a 9" pan and it rose so tall and cracked on the edges even before it was done baking and it cracked as it cooled as well. I have baked many cheesecakes and have found that recipes using 4 pks of cream cheese bake better in a 10" pan. If she make this one again that's what she will do. But over all it was a nice cheesecake for the first time.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
2. Line a 6-inch non-stick fry pan with bacon slices arranging them in a radial pattern and starting with one end of bacon in the centre of the pan and the other end draped over the edge. When the entire surface of the pan has been covered sprinkle with pepper and add a layer of sliced potatoes to cover the bottom. Sprinkle with grated cheese salt and pepper and repeat layers until they are slightly above the top of the pan.
3. Fold the bacon one slice at a time up and over the potato mound toward the centre. Carefully overlap each slice and repeat until the top is completely and neatly covered with bacon. Press down and cover with a lid.
4. Place tart on a baking sheet which will catch any drips during cooking. Bake for 3 hours. It has to cook low and slow so the potatoes cook and the bacon doesn't burn. The lid will eventually come down and sit on the pan as the food cooks.
5. Turn pan over and invert tart onto a serving plate. Cut into 6 slices.,

2. 2) In another smaller bowl beat together the milk and eggs and vanilla.
3. 3) Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in about half the liquid mixture. Blend well then add the remaining liquid and stir till fairly smooth; a few lumps can remain.
4. 4) Stir in the butter. Cover and let sit for at least an hour.
5. 5) The best thing to cook crepes in is a 10-inch cast iron pan (or for smaller crepes the little crepe pan we sell in our catalogue). Heat the pan until it's medium-hot. Wipe the bottom of the pan with a bit of butter or oil(a paper towel works well).
6. 6) Pour a scant 1/3 cup of batter into the bottom of the pan pick it up and tip it in a circle so the batter covers the bottom of the pan. Cook until the bottom begins to brown and you can slide a spatula under it. It will hold together quite well so you can flip it over easily.
7. 7) Cook briefly on the other side and place on a warm plate. Cover until the remaining batter is cooked. Fill with fruit and whipped cream sweetened cream cheese and berries or anything else from bananas and chocolate or caramel to ice cream and maple syrup.
8. Tips:   In the mood for something savory? Just leave out the sugar and vanilla and you'll have a great canvas for a wonderful dinner entree.,

instructions, 1. Pre-heat broiler to 500°F.
2. In a large bowl add all the burger ingredients together (except the buns).
3. Mix well (don't be afraid to use your hands just make sure you wash them well before and after mixing).
4. Divide your mixture into 4 equal parts. (i use a scale to make sure the meat is divided equally).
5. Shape each of the 4 pieces of meat into burger pates.
6. Make the pates thicker at the edges and thinner in the centre since burgers tend to get rounder and thicker at the centre when you cook them. This way they come out flat once cooked.
7. If you are going to grill the burgers it helps if they are frozen first so they don't crumble.
8. Place the pates on a baking sheet lined with foil (to help with cleaning).
9. Place the baking sheet under the broiler for 16 minutes turning half way threw.
10. In a skillet add a little oil (which ever kind you like cooking with).
11. Once the oil is hot add the mushrooms.
12. Add the minced garlic salt and Italian seasoning to the mushrooms.
13. Stir the mushrooms often so they are cooked evenly.
14. Once the mushrooms are cooked and browned remove them from the skillet.
15. One the bottom buns of the burgers spread some mayo.
16. Once the burger is cooked add the burger to the bottom bun.
17. Then add a zigzag of ketchup to each burger.
18. Layer the mushrooms on top of that then the top bun.
19. Serve with a side of coleslaw pickle and backed potato or fries.,

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat oven to 425*F. Whisk pumpkin sweetened condensed milk eggs spices and salt in medium bowl until smooth. Pour into crust. Bake 15 minutes.
2. 2. Reduce oven temperature to 350*F. and continue baking 35 to 40 minutes or until knife inserted 1 inch from crust comes out clean. Cool. Garnish as desired. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator.
3. My Note:  This is an easy tip and makes a big difference in taste - in a medium pan over low heat heat up the canned pumpkin puree spices and salt. Heating the pumpkin puree up takes out the "canned" taste of the pumpkin and melds the spices together nicely. Then pour the mixture out into another bowl and let it cool a bit before adding the condensed milk and eggs. This little change makes the pumpkin taste much fresher! My family loves this recipe and I use a ready-made graham cracker crust.
4. A suggestion is to let the pie cool on the oven rack because it cools more slowly that way. If you take it out onto the kitchen counter the filling sometimes cracks because of the cold air.
5. My wife Tips: I did not use the ginger nor the nutmeg; instead I added 2 teaspoons of "McCormik's Pumpkin Pie Spice" (which includes: Cinnamon Ginger Nutmeg and Allspice) along with the 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. My wife loved it but she thought it needed more cinnamon. So I made the next one with 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and she loved it. If you like a lot of cinnamon that's the way to go. For me I preferred 1 teaspoon but I'd eat it either way. Thanks EAGLE BRAND I do make two pies.,

3. Bake the apple filling in a baking pan for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.

5. Spray a smooth clean surface with cooking spray and turn the dough out onto the surface. Knead the dough briefly to give it a smooth surface. Spray a rolling pin with cooking spray and roll the dough out into a large rectangle about 12 inches x 16 inches in size. Lift onto a greased baking sheet.
6. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife cut each side (left and right) into horizontal strips about 1-inch wide down each side leaving the center third of the dough uncut. Spread the apple filling down the middle third of the dough. Fold strips of dough into the center crisscrossing the filling by alternating strips from each side. Lightly press dough ends to seal and straighten out the braid with your hands if necessary.
7. Bake the braid in the oven until golden brown (25 minutes). Remove from the oven and let the braid cool for several minutes.

7. Fold in M&M's and chocolate chips again until just blended.<-I like the Peanut Butter M&M's and semi-sweet chocolate chipits --  but whatever floats your boat --  as long as it equals 1 cup --  or a little more ;-).
8. Spoon approx 2-3 tbsp onto the parchment. I use a medium ice cream scoop. Do not press down they will become perfect in the oven.
9. I press a couple extra M&Ms onto the top of each cookie to make them look extra yummy.
10. Place 6-9 cookies on one pan spread apart.
11. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes The center will still be soft but sides will brown a little.
12. Let cool on cookie sheet for 10 min and transfer to cooling rack.
13. Viola and Enjoy!,

cuisine, North American >> Canadian >> Canadian, 
time, ,

instructions, 1. Heat oil in a large deep skillet and add onion. Sweat onion over medium heat until translucent. Add garlic and continue cooking over medium heat until fragrant.
2. Sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper and add to the skillet browning them over medium high heat. Flip the chops to brown both sides. The meat should be golden brown on both sides but does not have to be cooked through.
3. Meanwhile stir together the two cans of soup parsley and canned mushrooms/dried mushrooms (if using).
4. Place the potato slices into the skillet around between and atop the chops and pour over the soup mixture. Use a spoon or spatula to gently stir the contents of the skillet to distribute the sauce over all the potatoes and meat. Be sure to scrape up the golden brown bits (fond) from the bottom of the pan and stir them into the sauce.
5. Simmer over medium heat approximately 30-40 minutes or until the potato slices are cooked through (tender) stirring gently at least twice through the cooking time.
6. Note: If your family likes strong mushroom flavours then I highly recommend the use of dried mushrooms in this dish. If your family is not so keen on mushrooms then leave out the canned and dried mushrooms. The sauce will still have a strong cream-gravy especially if you fried the chops to a golden colour and scraped the bottom of the pan to rescue those flavours. This recipe holds up well to experimentation with dried spices and other add-ins. Try adding dried pakprika (sweet) chives thyme sage applewood smoke seasoning a few spoonfuls of sour cream or a handful of homemade bacon bits for variation.,

instructions, 1. Slice the grapefruit very very thinly with a sharp knife into flat slices.  then cut these into strips and cut the strips into smaller bits.  Keep all the juice that flows out if it's a juicy grapefruit.
2. Bring 6 cups of water to a boil and then add the grapefruit slices and juice.
3. Keep at a low boil adding the sugar.  Continue boiling for quite some time (20-30 minutes) until it begins getting thicker.
4. The tricky part is knowing when to stop boiling. If you wait too long it will become too thick when it cools.  The important thing to know is it thickens a bit when cooling so you have to stop it before it reaches the desired consistency.  I put a porcelain dish in the fridge then pour a little onto the dish - if it congeals a little then it's ready.
5. Before you bottle it eat it with bread while it's still warm - it's delicious!

instructions, 1. 1. Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water and cool. To cool more quickly rinse eggs under cold running water.
2. 2. Meanwhile place bacon in a large deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Alternatively wrap bacon in paper towels and cook in the microwave for about 1 minute per slice. Crumble and set aside.
3. 3. Peel the hard-cooked eggs and cut in half lengthwise. Remove yolks to a small bowl. Mash egg yolks with mayonnaise crumbled bacon and cheese. Stir in mustard. Fill egg white halves with the yolk mixture and refrigerate until serving.
4. My Note:   If you use real from the farm eggs you will get a more deeper yellow/orange yolk -- but if you use store bought as I did when I first made these I added a touch of red or yellow food coloring to deeping the texture a bit on the filling. Also be sure and use older eggs not too fresh of eggs do to the fact that fresh eggs can tear off the white in chunks when peeled and you will think you did not cook them long enough. Hope this helps!
5. I allways made a couple adjustments to Deviled Eggs. I added a little bit of finely choppedd white onion and I used bacon bits b/c it was a lot easier. My family really liked them! They said it was a nice change to the typical deviled eggs. I also used light mayo ot lighten it up a little and reduced fat cheese.
6. One time I made these for a party and now everyone wants me to bring them everytime! The most interesting part - many times people that swear they don't like deviled eggs will take 2-3 of these! I also add a little sour cream to make it smoother. And for decorating purposes I put the yolk mixture into a bag cut the corner off and pipe it into the eggs! I sprinkle it all with slices of green onion!
7. A neighbor of my did it but due to time constraints she used premade bacon that you can cook in the microwave by Oscar Meyer. It worked REALLY well and crumbled better than the regular bacon with less mess! (You may ahve to use more than 4 though as they are much smaller.) I also crushed an extra bacon slice into a fine pulp and sprinkled in on top of the eggs. For a decorative twist I put the yolk in a pastry bag and used a wide tip to put the filling in the whites instead of spooning them in like usual. I also used light mayo lowfat cheddar and I didn't know if I was supposed to use powedered mustard or yellow mustard I used the yellow mustard and it worked great and added color.
8. I also added a little chopped chives and green onion and dusted the tops with paprika. EDITED: I've made this deviled egg recipe many times now and every single time it turns out fantastic. This is also just as good with turkey bacon or pre-packaged bacon bits and I've found that this is wonderful with just about any cheese especially white cheddar cheese or pepperjack. I like to add a little hot sauce to the filling as I'm mixing it too. For easy piping I used a ziploc bag that I spooned the filling into then cut a corner out of the side of the bag. I just squeezed the egg filling carefully into the egg. When I'm finished I just throw out the bag. Nom. My neighbors fought over the last one. These are definetly making an appearance for my next holiday dinner. Have to make more next time.,

2. Stir in desired seasonings and 2/3rds of cheese until melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in macaroni.
3. Pour 1/2 of the macaroni mixture into a greased 1 1/2 quart baking dish. I like to use a 9 x 11 to spread it out thin. Sprinkle with half the remaining cheese. Top with the  other half of the macaroni and the rest of the cheese. It's ok to grate more cheese if you want and/or mix in other cheeses like mozzarella. I do!
4. Melt butter in a pan and toss in fresh bread crumbs until browned for topping OR sprinkle macaroni with packaged bread crumbs and dot with butter.
5. Bake at 350 for 30 mins until breadcrumbs are lightly browned. Since I spread it out thin and the ingredients are already warm it usually doesn't take the full 30 mins to cook. You don't want to dry it out ether. Let rest for about 5 mins before serving.,

instructions, 1. Mix the milk and yogurt together in a glass or pottery container (Do not use metal).
2. Place lid on it but don't seal it (sealed starters have been known to explode).
3. Put mixture in a warm place (80 to 90 degrees) for about 24 hours.
4. The yogurt and milk will separate forming a large curd when adding the flour just stir it all back together.
5. Add the flour stir and put back in warm place for 3 to 5 days; stirring daily.
6. It will bubble and have the odor of fermentation--it is ready to use.
7. Remember the starter is a living thing and needs to be fed and fed frequently when an infant.
8. I feed the "infant" weekly by placing it on the counter for several hours and allowing it to come to room temperature.
9. Then remove 1/2 cup starter discarding the remainder.
10. Feed the 1/2 cup with equal amounts of milk (buttermilk will produce a stronger sour taste) and unbleached flour; i.e. 1 cup flour and 1 cup milk plus 1/2 cup of starter.
11. If you would like you can feed the starter with 1/3 cup dry milk powder and 2/3 cup bottled water in place of the 1 cup milk.,

name, Banana Split Truffles Candy        by E. LaBau at Www About.com, 
cuisine, North American >> Canadian >> Canadian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. 1. Place the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat it until it simmers and small bubbles form all along the edges of the pan but do not allow it to come to a full boil.
2. 2. While the cream is heating prepare the white chocolate and banana mixture. If you have a food processor place the half banana in the food processor and mix until the banana has liquefied.
3. 3. Add the white chocolate chips to the banana and process until the white chocolate is in small pieces. The mixture will clump together so stop the processor several times to scrape it down. Once the cream is simmering with the processor on carefully pour the hot cream in a small stream down into the bowl of the processor and let it run until the white chocolate has melted and the ganache is smooth and free of lumps.
4. 4. If you do not have a food processor this can be done in a mixer or you can mash the banana by hand and add very finely chopped white chocolate to it stirring until well-combined. Pour the hot cream over the white chocolate-banana mixture and whisk it until it is smooth. This method produces a ganache that tastes the same but there might be small pieces of banana that are not incorporated.
5. 5. Once everything is smooth scrape the ganache into a bowl and whisk in the banana extract if using. Cover the ganache with cling wrap and refrigerate until firm enough to scoop and roll about 2 hours.
6. 6. Once the ganache is firm coat your hands with powdered sugar and roll the ganache into small balls dusting your hands with more powdered sugar to prevent sticking if necessary. You should get about 30 1-inch balls.
7. 7. Keep the balls chilling in the refrigerator while you melt the white candy coating. Once melted use a fork or dipping tools to dip the truffles into the coating then set them on a foil-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate the tray to set the white chocolate for 10 minutes.
8. 8. After all the truffles are dipped it’s time for the best part: decorating them! For the chocolate “sauce” melt the chocolate candy coating in a small bowl. In order to get the chocolate to drizzle just right it needs to be very thin and fluid. If your candy coating is thick add up to 2 tablespoons of oil adding a little at a time and stirring and testing after your additions. It should easily flow off the spoon in a thin line.
9. 9. Using a spoon place a small spoonful of dark chocolate on top of a truffle and use the tip of the spoon to nudge it off the sides in a thin stream. Alternately you can place the candy coating in a bag and cut off the tip and pipe it onto the truffles.* see note.
10. 10. After all of the truffles have their chocolate “sauce” sprinkle the still-wet chocolate liberally with colored sprinkles. The last step is to add your red candies that represent the cherry. This can be a red M&M jelly bean red hot or any other small red candy. Full-sized M&Ms are a little large for my taste so I like to cut them in half for my truffles but it’s definitely not necessary.
11. 11.  Refrigerate the tray to set the chocolate coating for about 10 minutes. Store Banana Split Truffles in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. For the best taste and texture bring them to room temperature before serving.
12. * My Notes & Tip's:  Once everything is smooth scrape the ganache into a bowl and whisk in the banana extract if you're using it. It's certainly not necessary but it does help to boost the banana flavor especially if you're using a banana that's not overly ripe.
13. *  I usually try to get 4-5 streams of chocolate dripping down the sides. Alternately you can place the candy coating in a bag and cut off the tip and pipe it onto the truffles as in step 9.
14. If the temperature of your room is moderately cool (60 to 70 degrees) your candies can be left out to set but if your room is warm or you want to speed up the process you can refrigerate them for approximately 30 minutes to set the chocolate. The exception is untempered chocolate which should always be refrigerated after dipping.,

instructions, 1. Toast english muffin as desired.
2. Prepare hollandaise sauce try Bev's recipe. It's great #57043.
3. Fry peameal bacon. Don't know what this is? You're crazy!  www.realcanadianbacon.com If you don't have peameal bacon a thick slice of ham will do. We're not talking lunchmeats here I mean a thick slice of fresh ham.  This is the important part of the recipe!
4. Poach the egg. Poach it well  my tastes are that it's not as good runny but you can decide.
5. Lightly butter the english muffin.
6. Put peameal bacon (or ham) on the muffin then place poached egg on top. On top of that set the slice of apple. You may alo use tangerine slices or peach slices something sweet to add another dimension of flavour to the eggs.  Then drizzle hollandaise sauce on top you can be decorative if you like.
7. Serve warm and enjoy! This is a great dish that requires little time to prepare and is as beautiful as it is tasty. The peameal add that extra element that makes it a less "fussy" breakfast and a more substantial one. Mmm!,

instructions, 1. Whisk flour yeast and salt in large bowl. Add water beer and vinegar. Using rubber spatula fold mixture scraping up dry flour from bottom of bowl until shaggy ball forms. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 8 to 18 hours.
2. Lay 12- by 18-inch sheet of parchment paper inside 10-inch skillet and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Transfer dough to lightly floured work surface and knead 10 to 15 times. Shape dough into ball by pulling edges into middle. Transfer dough seam-side down to parchment-lined skillet and spray surface of dough with nonstick cooking spray. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until dough has doubled in size and does not readily spring back when poked with finger about 2 hours.
3. About 30 minutes before baking adjust oven rack to lowest position place 6- to 8-quart heavy-bottomed Dutch oven (with lid) on rack and heat oven to 500 degrees. Lightly flour top of dough and using razor blade or sharp knife make one 6-inch-long 1/2-inch-deep slit along top of dough. Carefully remove pot from oven and remove lid. Pick up dough by lifting parchment overhang and lower into pot (let any excess parchment hang over pot edge). Cover pot and place in oven. Reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees and bake covered for 30 minutes. Remove lid and continue to bake until loaf is deep brown and instant-read thermometer inserted into center registers 210 degrees 20 to 30 minutes longer. Carefully remove bread from pot; transfer to wire rack and cool to room temperature about 2 hours.
4. Note: See the related information in "High-Heat Baking in a Dutch Oven" for information on converting Dutch oven handles to work safely in a hot oven. How can I keep my Dutch oven safe when baking in a really hot oven? Our recipe for Almost No-Knead Bread calls for preheating a Dutch oven to 500 degrees. After publishing our recipe it was called to our attention that the manufacturers of both our favorite Dutch oven (the 7 1/4-Quart Round French by Le Creuset) and our best buy Dutch oven (the 6.5 Quart Cast Iron Dutch Oven by Tramontina) recommend against heating the pots to this temperature due to the phenolic knobs used on the lids. And we subsequently learned that in certain instances the pot itself might crack.
5. SOLVING THE KNOB PROBLEM: Fortunately there are two easy solutions. The knobs on both lids are secured with a single screw that is very easily removed. Once the knob is removed you can replace it with an inexpensive all-metal drawer handle purchased from a hardware store. Alternatively Le Creuset has introduced a stainless steel replacement knob for its Dutch ovens (which also fits perfectly on the Lodge enameled Dutch oven and the Chefmate Dutch oven) available for around $10 which is completely oven-safe. To fit this knob on the Tramontina Dutch oven you’ll need to use a single 3/8-inch-diameter 3/4-inch-long machine screw—the 1/2-inch screw that comes with the knob is not long enough to fit through the thicker lid of the Tramontina.
6. DEALING WITH THE CRACKING ISSUE: The enamel coating on cast-iron pots is made of vitrified glass. Although this material is built to withstand years of cooking it can crack if the pot is dropped the enamel has been improperly applied or thermal shock occurs. Thermal shock may occur if a cold empty pot is placed in a hot oven; if an empty pot is heated and then filled with cold food; or if a hot pot is placed on a cold surface. According to Le Creuset and Lodge (two of the leading manufacturers of enameled cast iron) the risk for thermal shock with our Almost No-Knead Bread recipe is low. The recipe calls for placing a cold pot in a cold oven heating the oven to 500 degrees and then placing room-temperature dough into the pot. Both manufacturers agree that there would be a much greater risk of thermal shock if cold food liquid or oil were placed in the hot pot. To prevent thermal shock when the pot is removed from the oven place it on a wire rack or trivet or on the cooking grate of the stove.

instructions, 1. Stir canned milk sugar and garlic powder until sugar is dissolved.
2. Add vinegar and continue mixing. The quicker you add the vinegar and the less you mix (I usually give the spoon 3 or 4 turns around the bowl) the thicker the sauce will be.
3. Let sauce sit for at least one hour in refrigerator before using. Eventually (hours to days later) the sauce may start to separate. DO NOT STIR IT. Simply skim the thick sauce off the top. It tastes fine despite the appearance that all the vinegar has seeped out of it.
4. You should be able to get thick sauce simply by following the instructions in the top recipe. I can get mine a bit thicker than yogurt. Occasionally I blow it and stir too much and the sauce gets thin again. If your sauce is not thick enough (I like spoons to stand up in it) follow the Ultra-Thick Donair Sauce Recipe I have posted.,

instructions, 1. 1. In a slow cooker combine corn cream cheese butter milk and sugar. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
2. 2. Cook on High for 2 to 4 hours or on Low for 4 to 6 hours.
3. My Note:    I do suggest using 1 and 1/2 (16 oz.) pkgs. of corn 1/4 teaspoons of pepper and 1 teaspoons of salt. I also think that it is best to heat all the ingredients except for the corn on the stovetop before placing in the crockpot. Start on high in the crockpot and cook for one hour. Turn to low and cook for around 3-4 hours.
4. If you didn't have frozen corn so I added 3 drained cans of regular corn instead and it came out perfect. I changed nothing else. Certainly a once in awhile thing with all the butter and cream cheese but I might try it out next time with a butter substitute and lower calorie cream cheese and see how that works out.
5. I have cut the corn off 4 leftover ears and added a can of fiesta corn and a can of plain corn kernels that I had. As others said it seemed to need more corn for the amount of cream sauce that it makes. Do stir after your chunks of cream cheese and butter are at the melting point in your crock pot. They do not disperse evenly on their own. Flavor was more savory and corny than sweet if you do not add more sugar than the recipe calls for but I really liked that. The cream cheese did not give it a big cheesey taste either. I love cheese but I wasn’t trying to make cheese corn. Much different and more gourmet tasting than the stuff in the can.,

instructions, 1. 1. Place egg in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water cool peel and chop.
2. 2. Place the chopped eggs in a bowl and stir in the mayonnaise mustard and green onion. Season with salt pepper and paprika. Stir and serve on your favorite bread or crackers.
3. My Note:  It states 1/4 cup of green onion but my recipe is only about 2tbs or to your preference. Oh and its a simple recipe open to add any other things you would like to it if you are a veggie lover.
4. The first try was just as the recipe states and the second time I added a little celery and dill. Both times were very good!  This is good just as is but you can doll it up any way you like. For me that meant adding celery because for us it just isn't egg salad without it. But in the end this is an egg salad recipe for what it is - a good basic classic egg salad and not for all the fussier things it isn't. Some time I subbed pickels for the green onion and used dijon mustard. I liked the addition of paprika. Served it on a bun with lettuce tomato and a few more pickle planks.
5. I would love to hear any improvements and/or variations you make to this simple recipe. Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. FOR THE PIE DOUGH: Put the flour sugar and salt in a food processor fitted with a metal blade pulse just to combine the ingredients. Drop in the butter and shortening and pulse only until the butter and shortening are cut into the flour. Don't overdo the mixing- what you're aiming for is to have some pieces the size of fat green peas and others the size of barley. Pulsing the machine on and off gradually add about 6 tbsps of the water- add a little water and pulse once add some more water pulse again and keep going that way. Then use a few long pulses to get the water into the flour. If after a dozen or so pulses the dough doesn't look evenly moistened or form soft curds pulse in as much of the remaining water as necessary or even a few drops more to get a dough that will stick together when pinched. Big pieces of butter are fine. Scrape the dough out of the bowl and onto a work surface.
2. Divide the dough in half. Gather each half into a ball flatten each ball into a disk and wrap each half in plastic. Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour before rolling (if your ingredients were very cold and you worked quickly though you might be able to roll the dough immediately: the dough should be as cold as if it had just come out of the fridge).
3. To Roll Out the Dough: Have a buttered 9 inch pie plate at hand.  You can roll the dough out onto a floured surface or between sheets of wax paper or plastic wrap or in a rolling slipcover. If you're working on a counter turn the dough over frequently and keep the counter floured. If you are rolling between paper plastic or in a slipcover make sure to turn the dough over often and to life the paper plastic or cover frequently so that it doesn't roll into the dough and form creases.  If you've got time slide the rolled out dough into the fridge for about 20 minutes to rest and firm up.
4. FOR THE PIE:  Butter a 9-inch Pyrex pie plate.  Working on a well-floured surface (or between wax paper or plastic wrap) roll out one piece of the dough to a thickness of about 1/8th inch. Fit the dough onto the buttered pie plate and trim the edges to a 1/2 inch overhang. Roll the other piece of dough into a 1/8 inch thick circle and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment or a silicone mat. Cover both the circle and the pie plate with plastic wrap and refrigerate while you pre-heat the oven and prepare the filling.
5. Getting Ready to Bake: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and pre-heat the oven to 425°F.
6. Put the berries in a large bowl and gently stir in the sugar flour salt zest and juice; let sit for about 5 minutes. Taste the filling and add more sugar and/or lemon juice if needed.
7. Remove the pie shell and top crust from the refrigerator. Sprinkle an even layer of the breadcrumbs over the bottom of the shell. Give the filling a last stir and turn it into the crust.
8. Using your fingertips moisten the rim of the bottom crust with a little cold water. Center the top crust over the filling and gently press the top crust against the bottom. Either fold the overhang from the top crust under the bottom crust and crimp the edges attractively or press the top crust against the bottom crust and trim the overhang from both crusts even with the rim of the pie plate. If you've pressed and trimmed the crust use the tines of a fork to press the two crusts together securely. Using a small sharp knife cut 4 slits in the top crust crust and cut a circle out of the center then lift the plate onto the baking sheet. (If you have time refrigerate the pie for about 30 minutes. The pie can also be wrapped airtight and frozen for up to 2 months. Glaze and sugar it before you put it in the over and add at least 15 minutes to the baking time).
9. Brush the top crust with the egg wash then sprinkle the crust with a little sugar just to give it sparkle.
10. Bake the pie for 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 F and bake the pie for another 30 minutes or so (total baking time is about an hour) or until the crust is a beautiful golden brown and the filling is bubbling up through the slits. If the crust seems to be browning too quickly make a loose foil tent for the pie.
11. Transfer the pie to a rack and let it cool and settle for at least 30 minutes before serving.,

instructions, 1. Heat the oven to 350°F and place a rack in the middle of the oven.
2. Place the chocolate wafers in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade and pulse until ground into evenly sized crumbs or place them in zip-top bag and pulverize them with a rolling pin or meat mallet until finely crushed. You should have about 1 1/2 cups of crumbs.
3. Place the crumbs in a medium mixing bowl. Drizzle in the melted butter and mix with a fork until the crumbs are evenly moistened (if using a food processor drizzle the butter through the feed tube while pulsing).
4. Transfer the buttered crumbs to a 9-inch pie plate and use your fingertips or the back of a spoon to press the mixture evenly into the pie plate spreading it up the sides but not over the rim.
5. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes or until the sides of the crust feel firm to the touch. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before filling.
6. Place the milk cream and vanilla bean in a 4-quart saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat stirring occasionally until almost about to simmer (Do not let it boil). Remove from the heat and let the vanilla bean steep in the milk for 15 minutes.
7. Place the egg yolks sugar salt and cornstarch in a medium mixing bowl and beat with a whisk until well blended (1 minute).
8. Remove the vanilla bean from milk. Use a knife to scrape out as many seeds as possible and add them to the milk. Swirl the pod in the milk to remove any remaining seeds. Discard the pod or save for another use.
9. Add 1 1/2 cups toasted coconut and place the pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer then remove from the heat.
10. Ladle out about 1/2 cup of the hot milk and whisk it into the egg mixture. Slowly pour the egg mixture into the pot of milk whisking steadily to keep the eggs from curdling.
11. Place the pot over medium-high heat and bring the mixture to a boil stirring constantly but not furiously. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook while whisking constantly (make sure to get the sides and edges) until the mixture is very thick (2-3 minutes). Remove from the heat add the butter and stir until melted then stir in the coconut rum.
12. Let the filling cool to lukewarm (about 15 minutes) then pour into the cooled pie shell. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface (to keep a skin from forming). Refrigerate the pie for at least 4 hours before serving.
13. Just before serving make the whipped cream topping. Place the cream and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or if using a whisk or hand-held mixer put it in a deep mixing bowl.
14. Beat on medium speed until frothy. Sprinkle in the confectioners’ sugar and beat on medium-high until stiff peaks form (when the whisk is lifted the cream will form a point that doesn't droop).
15. Mound the whipped cream in the center of the chilled pie. Use the back of a large spoon or an offset metal spatula to spread it out to the edge and give it a few decorative swirls. Sprinkle with remaining toasted coconut and serve.,

3. Using your hands shape the meat mixture into a large egg shape.  With two spatchulas going under the large egg ball in both directions --  gently place meat into the heated oil cover and simmer each side until nice and brown --  colour of brown sugar.  When ready to turn over again use the spatchulas --  it makes it easy to flip when using the two of them.  If the meat breaks this is an indication that it was not browned enough on one side.
4. Once both sides have browned put in the two cans of tomato soup with ½ can of water and stir until the tomato soup is well blended with the water and oil.  Cover and let simmer for 30 minutes.
5. Our family enjoys this best with garlic mashed potatoes but some like it with plain rice as the sauce is wonderful with both.,

instructions, 1. Prepare crust. In a mixing bowl combine flour salt and sugar mix well. Add butter. Using a pastry blender or a fork blend in butter until the mixture is crumbly like oatmeal. Gradually add the ice water 1-tablespoon at a time just until the dough comes together. Be sure not to add too much water. Empty the dough from the mixing bowl on to a piece of waxed paper. Using the waxed paper shape the dough into a flat disc. Wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator for at least half an hour. You may also use your hands to form the dough into a disc but the less you touch the dough the flakier the crust will be.
2. Prepare apple filling. In a large mixing bowl add sliced apples. Sprinkle with lemon juice cinnamon nutmeg vanilla white sugar and golden raisins. Toss well to combine. Add butter in small pieces and toss.
3. Prepare a baking sheet by lining with a piece of parchment paper. Preheat oven to 400F degrees. Remove dough from the refrigerator. On a floured surface roll dough into a rough circle about 13 inches in diameter or 1/4 inch in thickness. Gently roll dough back up onto the rolling pin and transfer onto baking sheet. Pour apple mixture into the centre of the dough.
4. Gently fold up the edges of the dough over the apples leaving the centre open. You want the tart to look quite rustic not shaped evenly like a pie. Make an egg wash using 1 egg and a splash of water. Whisk well with a fork. Brush egg wash over the crust evenly with a pastry brush. Sprinkle the crust with white sugar. Sprinkle chopped pecans over the whole tart gently pressing into the crust so they stick to the egg wash. Place in oven at 400° F and bake for 12 minutes. The high heat will help to cook the bottom of the tart well and to create a flakier crust.
5. After 12 minutes turn the oven down to 350° F and continue baking for another 25 to 30 minutes or until centre is bubbling and the crust is golden brown in colour. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream a sprig of fresh mint and a sprinkling of cinnamon.,

instructions, 1. 1. NOTE: BAKES at 425* & 350* Use a deep dish pie plate for this recipe (mine is 10"x 2.5") If you do not have a large pie plate I would opt for a 'cobbler' treatment of these ingredients in a 9x9x2 glass pan. CRUST: Combine flour & (chilled) butter until crumbly. Stir in: ground nuts (prefer pecans) & orange zest (from one large fruit or two cuties). Add 1 Tbl vinegar; use apple cider if its on hand) to egg yolk stir both into crumbs. Add ice water 1 Tbl/ time until dough is firm.
2. 2. Divide dough into 1/3 2/3 portions. Roll/press larger portion of dough to cover bottom & sides of pan. Pre-bake for 10 min at 425* Set aside. Roll top portion into desired shape: full crust or lattice (set away from heat).
3. 3. FILLING: Drain sweet cherries (in syrup) reserve juice. Drain tart cherries reserve juice. Add all cherries to bowl along with whole can of pie filling. Stir triple sec & almond into this bowl. Set aside.
4. 4. Reduce sweet cherry syrup to half over med heat. Will bubble so make sure pan/ bowl is larger than 4 cups to allow for this w/o spill over. Stir 2 Tbl cornstarch into 2 Tbl of tart cherry juice (from can) and add to reduced syrup. Stir constantly over heat until nicely thickened.
5. 5. Fold cherries into this and blend gently. This mixture should include all of the filling ingredients and should be a rich red color and cling well to spoon.
6. 6. FINISH: Add filling to bottom crust. Lay top crust over filling. Brush w/ egg white esp around edges to seal to bottom crust. If using solid/whole top crust remember to cut several vents. If lattice no worries. Egg white on top can be combined w/ or sprinkled w/ a little sugar (@ 1 Tbl) for nice finish. This step just adds a nice golden color.
7. 7. Bake at 425* for first 10 minute Reduce to 350* for remaining 25-30 minute Remove when top crust is golden & filling is bubbly.,
