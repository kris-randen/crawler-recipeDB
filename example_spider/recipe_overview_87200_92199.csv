instructions, 1. Being that I like to cook quick (and so do you probably) I like to dice chop and get everything out and measured and put aside before I even begin the cooking so dice your onions and chop up the bell peppers. You can leave the seeds of the peppers if you'd like but make sure to de-stem them.
2. In a pot heat vegetable oil over medium heat.
3. Add the chopped peppers diced onions salt pepper cumin chili powder and cayenne. Stir VERY frequently (about 1-2 minutes) and make sure that the all the spices are mixed into the vegetables.
4. Immediately and in a separate pot prepare your rice according to the package.
5. When rice is cooked add it to the cooking veggies.
6. Add the canned tomatoes and stir frequently on medium heat.
7. Cook for 30-45 minutes on medium heat stirring frequently to avoid burning the rice and so that the rice can absorb the tomato oil cumin chili powder cayenne salt and pepper.
8. If you want a variation add small pieces of cooked hamburger meat (prepared in a separate skillet) to the mix. You can add salt pepper cumin chili powder and cayenne to that as well before finally adding it to the mix. If you are a brontosaurus and don't eat meat like your T-Rex friends skip this step.
9. You will know the rice has absorbed everything and that everything is cooked when the rice is golden. (Note: if you believe the rice to taste too salty gradually add just pinches of sugar until the flavor balances back out; sugar kids is a great equalizer -- use it wisely.).

2. Combine all ingredients in food processor and pulse until the dip combines and the jalapenos are minced.  This will tend to aerate the dip.  If it bothers you leave the sour cream out and pulse the other ingredients in the milk only.  Stirring in the sour cream after will break the bubbles in the milk and provide a creamier texture.
3. If the dip is too thin stir in additional sour cream (up to an additional half cup) to bring it to the desired consistency.

Remove some of the blackened charred skin from the tomatoes (it's probably mostly peeled back by now). Put all the cooled veggies in the food processor and blend.
4. Combine with the rest of the ingredients and chill. Flavors will develop and salsa will be ready to serve within a few hours.,

instructions, 1. Soften cream cheese slice up your green onions and add your herbs --  I taste as I go and there are many combinations but this has been my favorite.  Blend well and put your tortillas on a flat surface.  Spread cream cheese mixture to edges and roll up.
2. If you use the 6 inch tortillas it makes about 6 or 7 rolls depending on how thick you spread the cheese.
3. Put in the refrigerator covered with saran wrap.  Let them chill back until they are firm.  Then remove and cut in 3/4 inch slices.  Arrange on a dish with toothpicks and have your salsa in the center to dip!
4. Delicious!,

instructions, 1. Grate cheddar cheese and set aside in covered container in refrigerator for later use.
2. Pre-measure spices and enchilada sauce for later use.
3. Dice onion and set aside.
4. Brown hamburger without spices yet plain and the diced onion together until done through and onion translucent.
5. Drain off excess hamburger fat but leave hamburger mixture in skillet over low heat (simmer).
6. Add Mexican spices to hamburger mixture (cumin chili powder oregano coriandergarlic salt and pepper and add about a quarter to a half cup of water to hamburger mixture with spices in it. Stir around and cover heating over low simmer for ten minutes. This lets spices steam into the hamburger mixture.
7. Remove hamburger from heat and set aide for cooling and later use in enchilada filling.
8. Heat canned enchilada sauce in a large saucepan but don’t boil. Merely heat until very warm and then leave on simmer in sauce pan.
9. Take  tortillas and in a hot skillet fry each tortilla one at a time until it is part way fried but still flexible Take that tortilla with tongs and dip into heated enchilada sauce in sauce pan.
10. Lay dipped tortilla in your final oven baking casserole pan and in the center  spoon about 2 tablespoons of meat and a tablespoon or two of the grated cheese.
11. Roll up the dipped stuffed tortilla like a cigar and place crease face down in baking dish.
12. Repeat this process for each tortilla (frying tortilla half-way dipping in heated sauce laying open in pan putting in filling and rolling tortilla placing crease down in pan).
13. Order all the tortillas you have done this way in neat rows across the bottom of your baking casserole pan.
14. Make only one layer deep don't stack them vertically.
15. Once you have the whole bottom of your baking pan covered with rolled tortillas that have been stuffed and placed in baking dish take the rest of your enchilada sauce and pour it down the center between the rows and then dribble a little evenly across the top of the enchiladas.
16. Take the remainder of grated cheese not used in the filling and evenly pile evenly across the top of the rolled enchiladas and sauce. Make sure the enchiladas are nicely covered with grated cheese.
17. Place baking dish in oven or roaster at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes or until bubbling and done.
18. At the last minute about 10 minutes before the enchiladas are done and bubbling and ready to serve sprinkle either optional (drained) ripe black olive (bits or sliced)over the top of the enchiladas.
19. Alternatively you can use chopped green onions to sprinkle over top of the enchiladas. Either topping (not both at same time) works to form a nice touch. However don't put the olives or green onion on too early in the baking process or else the toppings(olives or onions) will get shriveled dried out and not attractive and tasty.
20. Bake until done the way you want them.
21. **Note: If you like instead of the classic rolled enchiladas you can make this recipe as a "stacked" enchilada recipe. You will need to increase all the ingredients doing it this way as it takes more filling and more cheese.  If you want to do it this way do the following: instead of rolling the enchiladas up into cigar shape you can lay out the fried tortillas dipped in sauce end to end flat across the bottom of the baking pan and then spoon the hamburger filling in a layer over the dipped tortillas then add your cheese part of the filling sprinkling cheese across the hamburger filling. And repeat this process doing layer after layer stacking vertically instead of rolling and making only one layer high of the rolled type enchilada. Do this until you heave come most but not all the way up to the top of the baking pan. You want to lave room at the top of baking pan for the top layer of generously piled on grated cheese. In essence you are making this into a sort of "enchilada casserole" using the same ingredients but maybe 50 percent more of the listed amount of ingredients in order to adequately cover the layers.,

instructions, 1. To make the dough-.
2. Cut the chilled lard into small pieces and mix into the flour with your fingers until it is lumpy and coarse.
3. Don’t overwork it.
4. Add the ice water a tablespoon at a time while stirring it with a fork or spoon until it forms a ball.
5. You will have to pick it up and form the ball but you will still see the lard in it a bit like streaked marble.
6. It should be a little sticky but not too.
7. Put it in the fridge for an hour to chill and then remove and let it come to room temperature for one hour before you roll it.
8. When you are ready to fill the empanadas roll the dough out to 1/8 inch.
9. Cut 4 inch circles with a cookie cutter or whatever you have on hand.
10. A friend taught me the secret to puff pastry dough.
11. It is this-2 parts flour to 1 part lard (butter has water in it and therefore will not be flakey like lard.) You can alter the amount of dough you need but keep this simple formula and you will have success.
12. You can also use ready made dough to speed things up considerably.
13. To make the filling-.
14. Soak the raisins in the white wine until plump about 20 minutes do this before you start the rest.
15. Cut the tomatoes in half and grate them (yes GRATE them on your cheese grater) by pressing down hard right down to the skins.
16. Discard the skins.
17. Add the contents to a blender and add the reconstituted ancho and the chipotles juice of 1 lime and ½ of the cumin.
18. Blend until smooth.
19. Brown the beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat until well browned about 15 minutes.
20. Drain off the excess fat and add the onions stir until translucent about 3-5 minutes.
21. Add the diced Jalapeño and the Serranos stir until fragrant and a bit soft about 3 minutes.
22. Add the glass with the raisins including the wine and stir while scraping the brown bits from the bottom of the pan until the wine is evaporated and the raisins are soft about 5 minutes.
23. Add the pressed garlic and stir until fragrant about 1 minute.
24. Add the rest of the cumin nutmeg coriander cinnamon and salt and stir for about 30 seconds.
25. Add the contents from the blender bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for about 1 hour.
26. Taste and adjust the seasonings if necessary.
27. HINT- if you use chipotles in adobo omit the tomatoes and use a little low-sodium chicken broth to thin the sauce if necessary.
28. To fill them-.
29. Have a fork a glass of water and some excess flour handy.
30. Dip your finger in water and run it around the bottom half of the dough circle on the edge like a smiley face.
31. Take a tablespoon of filling a pinch of cheese and then fold the dough over it and press down gently so it stays in place.
32. Take the tines of the fork dip them in flour and press down around the edges of the empañada to seal.
33. Poke a hole in the top and freeze immediately.
34. Adjust the amount of filling so that the empanada is not over-filled but plump.
35. Your first ones will be ugly but with a little practice they will turn out perfectly and well sealed.
36. This will make about 30+ empañadas depending on how much filling you put inside.,

4. After your onion celery and pork have cooked down a bit add in the salsa verde diced green chiles and El Pato (I use the jalapeno version for this recipe.  It's the one that comes in the green can).  Add as much of this as you'd likebut take heed that it's warmer than the other salsas.
5. Stir together and let simmer.
6. Juice the lime into the mix season with the celery salt add the cumin and mix.
7. I love to serve this with sour cream diced cilantro and shaved cabbage (red or green works great).  It also goes well with these tortillas:http://www.recipezaar.com/65491.

instructions, 1. Special equipment:
2. Tortilla press.
3. For the tortillas:
4. Combine the masa water shortening and salt in a bowl. Bring the mixture together with your hands and make into a uniform disc. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for about 20 minutes.
5. Preheat a large cast-iron pan over high heat. Line the tortilla press with parchment paper.
6. Portion the dough into golf-ball-size balls about 1 1/2 ounces each. Place 1 ball at a time into the tortilla press between two sheets of parchment paper. Press down on the tortilla press. Carefully peel away one sheet of the parchment. Flip the exposed side of the tortillas onto your hand and carefully remove the other side of the parchment. Place the tortilla directly onto the preheated skillet. Cook until the edges begin to curl and bumps form 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.
7. For the enchiladas:
8. Combine the chicken chicken broth salt garlic and onions in a large saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat cover with a lid and simmer until the chicken is fully cooked about 20 minutes. Remove the chicken and set aside to cool. When cool enough to handle shred the chicken and set aside.
9. For the Colorado sauce:
10. Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Toast the chiles skin-side up until fragrant and beginning to darken 30 seconds to 1 minute.
11. Transfer the chiles to a bowl and pour over the boiling water or enough to cover the chilies; soak until softened about 15 minutes. Transfer the chiles and steeping liquid to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until a smooth paste forms.
12. Heat the vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the coriander cumin garlic and onions and cook until softened and fragrant 6 to 8 minutes. Whisk in the blended chile paste and bring to a simmer. Cook until slightly reduced and flavors are developed 4 to 6 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Set aside.
13. For assembly:
14. Pour 1/4 inch vegetable oil into a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Soften the tortillas one at a time in the hot oil about 5 seconds. Set each tortilla on a paper towel afterwards to soak up some of the oil.
15. To assemble the enchiladas dip a softened tortilla in simmering Colorado sauce and place on a work surface. Add 2 tablespoons shredded chicken and 1 tablespoon Colorado sauce. Roll up tightly and place on a serving platter.
16. Top the enchiladas with crumbled queso fresco onions and cilantro. Drizzle with some crema if using and serve immediately.,

instructions, 1. Sift the flour salt & baking powder into a large mixing bowl.
2. Into the dry ingredients cut in the shortening or add oil if you are using this option & mix with your fingertips to combine.
3. Add the milk or water working the liquid into the dough until a sticky ball forms.
4. Wrap in plastic and let rest for at least 30 minutes.
5. Divide the dough into 8-10 balls (for small tortillas) or 6-8 balls for larger ones cover them again with the damp cloth.
6. Lightly dust a counter or pastry board w/flour & roll out each ball of dough into a circle or oval approximately 1/4" thick. If you want nicely rounded tortillas trim off any ragged edges & discard. Don't roll the dough out more than once or the tortillas will be tough.
7. Heat a dry griddle or heavy skillet over high heat for 5 minutes. Cook the tortillas 30 seconds on each side or until the dough looks dry & slightly wrinkled & a few brown spots form on both surfaces. Do not over cook or they will be hard. Butter and roll up and wrap in damp tea towel to keep warm as you cook the other tortillas.
8. (I place cooked ones wrapped in the damp towel in a low 200 oven to keep warm while I am cooking the rest.) Serve warm.~~.,

2. Prepare the chocolate cake according with the directions in the back of the box and beat until smooth and pour in the prepared pan.
3. In the blender place the two milks eggs and vanilla extract and blend well.
4. Now be very careful adding slowly the blended milk mixture over the chocolate cake mixture already poured in the pan.
5. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: place a sheet of aluminum foil on top of the bundt pan with the cake. Place in large roasting pan; add 1 inch of hot water to roasting pan. and then place it in the center rack of the preheated oven without moving the mixture too much so the cake and the flan won't mix with each other.
6. Cook for 1 hour and check for the flan to be cooked and set inserting a toothpick in the center of the cake. If it comes out clean the cake is done but if not let it in the oven covered with aluminum for 10 more minutes until flan is completely set.

instructions, 1. For The Chipotle Marinade:  Place the olive oil chipotle chiles lime juice honey garlic cilantro and salt in a blender; puree until smooth.
2. For The Mango Salsa:  In a medium-size bowl combine the diced mangoes black beans bell pepper scallions jalapeno chile cilantro and lime.
3. Prepare Chipotle Marinade as described above. In a non-reactive baking dish or a resealable plastic bag add the steaks and the Chipotle Marinade. Refrigerate 3 to 4 hours or overnight.
4. Remove steaks from refrigeration 1 hour before cooking and wipe excess marinade off the steaks. When you are ready to grill preheat barbecue grill.
5. Do not salt your steaks just before cooking. Salt brings moisture (water) to the surface of the steak and the water sits on the surface as you cook the steak. Thus you are again basically steaming the steak. Salt after the steak is cooked to your liking has rested the required time and just before serving.
6. Place steaks onto hot grill of your barbecue and grill to the desired degree of doneness about 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare. Use a meat thermometer to test for doneness:   Rare - 120 degrees F/Medium Rare 125 degrees F/Medium - 130 degrees F.
7. When the steaks are crusty-charred and done to your liking remove from the grill and let sit 15 minutes before serving (meat temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees after it is removed from the oven). Serve your perfectly cooked steaks with the prepared Mango Salsa.,

2. Remove the pork butts from refrigeration 1 hour before cooking. Do not remove the bone.
3. Heat the lard in a large stainless steel pot over high heat to 250 degrees F. The pot needs to be large enough to fit all the pieces of pork butt side by side not on top of each other and preferably not touching each other. Add enough lard to completely submerge the meat. Add the onion and garlic and let brown but do not burn. If garlic burns you must start the process over. Remove onions and garlic from the lard and discard.
4. Carefully add the pork pieces to the lard and then allow the oil to reach 250 degrees F again. Do not let the pork stick to the bottom or sides of pot. Stir around every 30 minutes to insure even coloring. Cook for approximately 1 to 1 1/2 hours. The pork should be caramel-colored with an internal temperature of 170 to 180 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer.
5. Five minutes before you are ready to remove the meat sprinkle the kosher salt into the oil. Continue to cook pork for 5 more minutes and then remove the pork from the oil to a platter. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.
6. Shred the meat and serve with Pico de Gallo warm tortillas salsa limes and radish slices.
7. Pico de Gallo:.
8. Salt and freshly ground black pepper.
9. Combine all ingredients and season with salt and pepper to taste. Let sit for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve.,

4. Measure about 1/2 cup rice pudding and place in center of each tortilla. Carefully fold each filled tortilla in half pressing gently to seal the edges (you should not need water or egg for this the rice pudding should be sufficient to keep them closed).
5. Pour oil in a large cast iron skillet (approx. 1/8" in depth). Heat over medium heat until oil is hot but not smoking (oil will appear to shimmer when it it hot enough). Fry empanadas in batches until crisp and golden brown (approximately 2 to 3 minutes per side). Remove from oil and set on paper towels to drain excess oil.

instructions, 1. Roast peppers under a the broiler until they start to char but do not over cook. you don't want them to turn black all over. Turn them periodically so roast evenly on all sides.
2. When the peppers are done sweat them by putting them in a zip lock bag and letting them cool.
3. Once cool carefully peel the skin off the peppers.
4. Using a small knife make a t shaped cut in the top of the pepper. you should cut appx 1 1/2 -2 inches across the top of the pepper and about 2 or 3 inches down the side. The cooler the pepper is the easier this will be without tearing the pepper too much.
5. CAREFULLY cut the seeds out of the pepper without tearing the pepper further. You want to leave the top of the pepper on and you only want the slit in the pepper to be big enough to be able to stuff the filling in later.
6. Prepare the filling by mixing the meat egg 1/2 cup salsa 1/2 cup of the cheese and seasonings in a bowl.
7. Gently stuff the peppers with the meat mixture a little bit at a time. You want them to be nice and full. Ideally when stuffed the opening in the pepper will be spread apart and you can see the meat but it should not be so full that the pepper loses its shape or tears
8. Place the peppers in a glass or ceramic baking dish. You want them to just fit perfectly so try to use a dish that is not too big.
9. Spoon some of the remaining salsa over each the meat that is visible on eache pepper. Any remaining sauce can be poured in between them to coat the bottom of the pan. The peppers and meat will create their own juice so its ok if the bottom of the pan isn't fully coated.
10. Sprinkle remaining cheese over the salsa on the peppers. I don't cover the whole pepper just the part of the filling that should be "coming out" of the top of the pepper but if you like a lot of cheese you may want to coat the whole pepper.
11. Cover w/ foil and bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Then uncover and bake for another 10 min or until cheese is golden brown.
12. ENJOY!
13. Variations: If I wasn't on a low carb diet I would add corn and chopped onion to the filling. Maybe use a corn and black bean salsa instead of a regular salsa. Also this isn't very spicy when you get the pablanos out of season but still tasty. So next time I make this in winter I will probably add hot sauce to the filling or use a hotter salsa. Another possibility would be to use jalepenos in the filling too. Sky's the limit.,

instructions, 1. In a blender or food processor process the salsa to a smooth puree.
2. Heat the oil in a very large (12 inch) skillet over medium high heat. When it is hot add the salsa all at once. Stir as the salsa reduces to the consistency of tomato paste about 5 minutes.
3. Stir in the broth and the tahini. Return to a boil then reduce the heat to medium low and let simmer 10 minutes. Taste and season with salt usually about ½ tsp and a little sugar. (The sugar will help balance the natural tartness of the salsa.).
4. While the sauce is simmering pour the peas into a microwaveable bowl sprinkle on a Tbsp of water cover with plastic wrap and poke a couple of holes in the top. Microwave on high until the peas are hot and tender anywhere from 1 minute for frozen peas to 4 or 5 minutes for fresh peas; discard water.
5. When the sauce has simmered for 10 minutes nestle the fish fillets in it completely submerging them. Continue simmering gently until the fish flakes when pressed firmly usually 5 to 6 minutes for ½ inch thick fillets. (Check it by lifting up a fillet on a metal spatula and pressing it with your finger or the back of a spoon.).
6. Transfer a fish fillet to each dinner plate. Spoon a portion of the sauce over the top. Strew with the peas sesame seeds and cilantro.
7. Variations:
8. You can replace the peas with a couple of medium-large red-skin boiling potatoes cut into eighths (microwave them until tender about 8 minutes). Mix the potatoes into the sauce after transferring the fillets to the dinner plates. A can of white beans makes a great replacement for the peas; drain and rinse them before adding them to the sauce. This dish is also wonderful made with boneless skinless chicken breasts or semi-boneless quail; poach the birds in the sauce as described or for added flavor brown them in oil in the large skillet then remove them and without washing the skillet cook down the pureed salsa. Tahini is an easy addition because it’s smoothly ground but you can use the very traditional pumpkin seeds or almonds or peanuts; puree them with the salsa but stir carefully as you cook the mixture down to a paste (it will stick more easily than the salsa alone) After the sauce has simmered 10 minutes it will likely be quite coarse looking; reblend the hot sauce in a loosely covered blender to smooth it out.,

instructions, 1. Prepare the Meat: Cut the pork into large chunks. Put the pork in a saucepan and fill with enough water to cover the meat by 1 inch. Add the bay leaves and crushed garlic. Bring to a boil and skim off the grayish foam that rises to the top during the  first few minutes. Decrease the heat to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes patially covered or until the pork is tender. (I found I needed to cook the pork double the amount of time.)
2. Allow the pork to cool in the stock then drain reserving 1 cup of the stock. Shred the pork by pulling apart the fibers with two forks or your fingers. Set aside.
3. Prepare the Chorizo: Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the chorizo to the pan and cook breaking it apart as you stir until it achieves a golden brown color and begins to render its fat. (Don't worry if some of the chorizo sticks to the bottom of the pan.) Using a slotted spoon remove the chorizo from the pan and set it aside.
4. Brown the Main Ingredients: Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the unwashed pan and set it over medium heat. Add the onion and remaining chopped garlic and saute until the onion begins to get limp and translucent 3 minutes. Add the shredded pork season with the salt and continue sauteing for 3 more minutes. Deglaze the pan by pouring in a couple of tablespoons of the reserved pork stock and scraping the bottom of the pan with a heatproof silicone spatula.
5. Finish the Stew: Add the chorizo tomatoes chipotles adobo from canned chipotles oregano thyme leaves and marjoram leaves to the pan. Stir well and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour in the remaining reserved pork stock and continue simmering uncovered for 25 minutes.
6. Garnish and serve: Pour the finished stew into a large shallow bowl and garnish sprigs of cilantro. SErve with tortilla chips and Mexican crema.,

instructions, 1. First prepare the Mojo de Ajo:
2. Chop the garlic by hand or in the food processor until the garlic bits are about an 1/8" in size--about 1/2 cup of chopped garlic.
3. Place the garlic in small saucepan measure in the oil and about 1/2 teaspoon of salt and set over medium low heat.
4. Stir occasionally as the mixture comes BARELY to a simmer (just the hint of movement on the surface of the oil).
5. Adjust the heat to the very lowest possible setting and cook stirring occasionally until the garlic is a soft pale golden --about thirty minutes.
6. Add the lime and simmer about five minutes until the juice has evaporated or been absorbed.
7. Stir in the chiles then taste and add additional salt if necessary.
8. Keep the pan over the lowest heat so the garlic will be warm when the shrimp are ready.
9. Put the lime wedges into a serving bowl and set them out.
10. Now prepare the Shrimp:
11. Set a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat and spoon about one and a half tablespoons of the oil (but not the garlic) from the mojo.
12. Add half the shrimp to the skillet sprinkle with salt and stir gently and continuously until the shrimp are just cooked through (3 to 4 minutes).
13. Add half the cilantro (if you're using it)and scoop the shrimp onto a warm deep serving platter.
14. Repeat with another one and a half tablespoons of the oil and the rest of the shrimp and cilantro.
15. Now finish the dish:
16. When all the shrimp are cooked and placed in the serving platter use a slotted spoon to scoop out the warm bits of garlic and chiles from the mojo pan and scatter them over the shrimp.
17. Serve with the lime wedges to as Mr. Bayless says add sparkle.
18. Note:  The Mojo de Ajo will keep in the fridge for a couple of weeks--the oil will become solid but will liquefy again at room temperature--warm it slowly before using.
19. Note 2: For the best texture cook the shrimp immediately before serving but you can cook them an hour or so ahead douse them with the garlic and serve at room temperature.,

2. 3-4 hours before dinner rinse the beans and add the remaining bean ingredients. You can dice the onion as fine as you like I usually cut the ends off one onion cut it in half across its axis peel off the outer layer and throw one half in the pot.
3. Simmer the beans for 2-3 hours until the beans are tender. Turn off the heat cover and set them aside if they're done before everything else.
4. About 1 hour before dinner soak the tomatoes in hot (boiled not boiling) water for a few minutes then rinse them in cold water and peel the skins off. Remove their seeds and cores and dice the tomatoes fine.
5. Dice the onions crush the garlic add to the tomatoes.
6. Remove the seeds and membranes from the serranos and dice them as fine as you can. Add them to the tomatoes onions and garlic.
7. Heat up a frying pan to medium high pour in the corn oil. When the oil is nice and hot add the vegetables (and fruit if you insist on being pedantic about it :p ) and fry until the onion is clear.
8. Transfer the vegetables from your frying pan to your rice cooker and add the remaining ingredients for the quinoa. Give it a good stir and turn it on.
9. When your rice cooker is finished cooking the quinoa strain and rinse the beans and stir them into the quinoa.
10. Serve on tostadas with sour cream crumbled goat cheese and guacamole. You could use queso fresco instead of the goat cheese but that little bit of pungence goes nicely with the quinoa. For the quacamole I mash two avocados and add crushed cumin seeds one clove crushed garlic kosher salt lime juice Buffalo chipotle sauce and fresh cilantro all to taste.,

instructions, 1. In a mortar and pestle or bowl mash together garlic jalapeno cilantro salt and pepper to make a paste.  Transfer the paste to a glass jar with a tight fitting lid.  Add the lime juice orange juice vinegar and oil.  Shake to make sure that the marinade is well combined.  (Note:  if marinating meat in a plastic bag you can transfer directly to the bag and mush to combine ingredients in the bag before adding meat.).
2. Place steak in a plastic bag or other container of your choice for marinating.  Add the marinade making sure the meat is coated.  Refrigerate and allow to marinate for about 4 – 6 hours.  (I don’t recommend marinating longer than that as the fibers of your meat will break down resulting in mushy meat.).
3. Preheat an outdoor grill or a ridged grill pan over medium-high flame.  (You can also use a broiler if desired.)  Brush the grill or broiler plate with a little oil to prevent the meat from sticking.
4. Remove meat from marinade.  Discard marinade.  Season on both sides with salt and pepper to taste.  Grill (or broil) the steak for 7 to 10 minutes per side turning once until medium-rare.  Remove from heat and let rest on a cutting board for about 7 minutes.
5. Meanwhile warm the tortillas for about 30 seconds on each side in a dry skillet or on the grill until pliable.  Remove to plate.  Cover to keep warm.
6. Thinly slice meat diagonally across the grain.
7. To serve:  Stack 2 of the warm tortillas.  Place about 4 oz. of the beef in the center.  Add lettuce onion and cheese as desired.  Top with a spoonful or two of the Pico de Gallo and garnish with a lime wedge.  Repeat with remaining tortillas.
8. ***NOTE***:  The marinade recipe for the steak will make about 1 ¼ cups and can be used for chicken too.  If not used as a marinade for meat it can also be used as a table-side condiment.  NEVER re-use marinade that has been in contact with raw meat as a condiment.  You can become sick from the harmful bacteria.,

instructions, 1. In large heavy saucepan melt the lard over medium low heat.  When it has melted but is not yet very hot add the pork water orange zest lime zest garlic and salt.  Cook at a gentle simmer stirring occasionally so that the meat evenly cooks for about 2 hours or until the meat is tender.  If the meat needs more time and all of the water has evaporated add a bit more water and continue cooking til the meat is tender.
2. Once the meat is tender. raise the heat to medium-high.  (Don' panic if the lard comes to a rolling boil - this will diminish as the water evaporates and will become small bubbles.)  After the boiling lard changes to small bubbles cook the meat for about 25 to 30 minutes or until light golden brown and crispy all over.  Remove the meat with a slotted spoon or tongs and drain on paper towels.  Sprinkle with salt.  When slightly cool pull the meat apart  usinmg 2 forks into shreds and smaller pieces and discard bones.
3. To heat tortillas heat a medium skillet over low heat.  Place the oil in a small dish and before placing in the pan brush both sides of each tortilla with a little of the oil. Place the oiled tortilla in the skillet and cook until just warm and soft 2-5 seconds per side.  Remove from the heat place on plate and cover with a cloth to keep warm until ready to serve.,

2. Meanwhile on a comal (or over open flame) roast chile until skin is charred and blistered turning occasionally for even roasting. About 2 -3 minute on each side. Place the chiles in a plastic bag and cover with towel. Let rest for about 15 minute Once cooled peel as much skin as possible without tearing the chile. Slice a small slit on side of chile and gently remove stem membranes and seeds with your fingers. If too many seeds are left try putting small opening of chile under soft running water for remaining seeds to wash out and dry with towel.
3. In a clean bowl and with clean beaters beat egg whites until foamy peaks form. About 5-7 minute Set aside. In another bowl beat egg yolks until thick and yellow about 4-6 minute Set aside.
4. Fill large frying pan with oil to about 3/4 way up of pan. Heat on medium high heat. IMPORTANT to make sure oil is hot enough to cook before placing peppers. Test oil by placing tiny amount of egg white in oil and waiting to hear if it immidietly sizzles.
5. Assemlble your work station: Beginning with meat then chiles then cheese then egg yolks then egg whites and finnally ending at the hot oil.
6. Stuff chiles with meat first (do not overstuff) with about 2 table spoons of meat depending on size of chiles. Then place 2 slices of cheese lenghwise in the chiles. Try to keep chile opening closed (you can secure with 2 toothpicks).
7. Place chile inside of bowl with yolk gently lifting chile  and supporting it under neath with both hands. Brush top side with yolk.
8. Gently dip yolk covered chile in egg white mixture (try to spoon egg white on top if not covered enough).
9. Gently slide chile into frying pan and let fry. While it is frying with a wide slotted metal spoon spoon some hot oil on top of chile. The egg whites will start to puff up. Fry for about 3 mins or until brown on that side. Gently flip with a spatula and fry the other side until brown.

instructions, 1. Fry the bacon in a large skillet until crispy; remove from pan reserving drippings cut into small pieces and set aside.
2. Add the oil to the bacon drippings over medium temperature then sauté the chicken and beef strips until browned stirring occasionally about 7 minutes.
3. In another large saucepan over medium heat stir together the boiling water and bouillon granules until dissolved.
4. Add remaining ingredients (including reserved bacon) and the cooked meat strips and simmer for 10 minutes.
5. Garnish serve and enjoy!
6. Note:  to make the seafood version of Azteca's Molcajete omit the chicken/beef and instead have 1/2 pound shelled and deveined shrimp 1/2 pound scallops and as much skinned and deboned whitefish fillet pieces as you'd like (about 1/4 pound or more) which you will add in during the last 5 minutes of cooking.
7. Note #2:  we've also added a can of black beans to the recipe to good effect.  If the soup isn't as thick as you'd like it to be try adding a can of refried beans - it works well!  We've also served it with crisp tortilla strips and a dollop of Mexican crema instead of monterey jack.  It's a versatile recipe so experiment and enjoy yourself!  :)  If you have made the Rich and Delicious Enchilada sauce recipe of mine you might recognize many of the soup ingredients - to make the sauce into soup use 2 cups of the sauce add 1 cup hot water and 1/2 teaspoon chicken stock granules then add the cooked chicken and garnish ingredients as usual.,

instructions, 1. Heat your grill to medium high.
2. Remove stems from tomatoes. Cut them in half lengthwise.
3. Cut onions into thirds. Cut against the onion's grain to make three patty like pieces.
4. Use some foil to make a pouch. Add garlic and 1 tbsp of oil. Fold up the foil and make a good seal.
5. Put Tomato halves on grill skin side down. Grill for 30 minutes or until skin is black. DON'T WORRY they aren't burnt.
6. After 30 minutes push the tomatoes to the side and flip them. Don't worry if they are losing juice -- it will be OK. Put jalapeños directly above flames and add your foil pouch to the grill as well. As jalapeno skins blacken and blister turn them to roast the whole pepper. This will take 10-15 minutes.
7. Place everything in a bowl and head back to your kitchen. Add everything to a blender or food processor EXCEPT 1/2 of the water 1/3 of the onion and the cilantro! Blend away! Continue to add water until you reach desired consistency. Some people may add more than a cup of water to get a thinner consistency (like Baja Fresh).
8. Chop remaining onion into small pieces. Add onions and cilantro to a large bowl. Mix in the ingredients from the blender and mix well. Chill for 2 hours before serving. Great with tortilla chips or on seafood or fish tacos. Throw a lime wedge in the bowl for a good presentation.,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 350'F. Bring one quart of water to a boil.
2. In a thin saute pan cook the sugar over medium heat until it is amber-coloured and bubbly. (Do not stir while it is cooking or you will get spun sugar and a big mess.) Watch the pan closely and lift the pan off the burner if the sugar is cooking quickly or unevenly. Shake the pan to distribute the melting sugar. When the sugar is completely caramelized pour the hot mixture into the bottom of a 3-quart flan mold Bundt pan loaf pan or individual molds. Rotate the mold(s) in your hands using potholders so that the sugar syrup covers the entire bottom of the pan. Set aside. Please be careful because the sugar is extremely hot and it can burn your skin.
3. In a medium mixing bowl combine the milk sweetened coconut milk (or un- sweetened coconut milk and sweetened condensed milk) egg yolks eggs vanilla and ginger and whisk well. Pour the batter over the caramelized sugar in the mold making sure to evenly distribute the crystallized ginger. Top with the sliced almonds.
4. Place the flan into another pan a bit larger. Add the hot water to the large pan around the flan mold to come halfway up the sides.  Cover with a lid or foil so that both pans are covered completely (bain-marie).
5. Bake the flan for 1 hour or until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean. Remove the flan from the water bath and chill it in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. TO serve loosen the sides with a knife and flip the flan mold over onto a platter. Garnish with flowers or fresh fruit and serve.
6. Hint:  It is better to make this a day ahead and chill it until it is as icy cold as possible so that the flavors have time to blend.,

4. Set aside for a few minutes. Turn your griddle onto high heat - this is so the chicken and veggies will sear not simmer or poach. It may splatter and sizzle - so beware! Don't cook naked.
5. Unless you have a restaurant sized grill you'll have to cook your fajitas in 2 batches. That's OK. When dinner smells this good - they'll wait.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 200°.
2. Place tortillas on baking sheet.  When oven is preheated place tortillas in oven for 15-20 minutes flipping once to dry out (you do not want moist tortillas in this case).
3. When tortillas are dried out cut into ¼ inch wide by 2 inch strips.
4. Boil chicken breasts in the chicken broth until they turn white in color and float.
5. Chop onion tomatoes and garlic.  Set aside in bowl.
6. Chop cilantro.  Set aside in another bowl.
7. Place poblano peppers under broiler or over the flame from a gas stove burner until the skin turns black in color.
8. Place poblanos in a plastic bag (you can use one like those you get at the grocery store) for 10-15 minutes.
9. When peppers are ready take out of bag run under cold water and with hands (you may wish to use gloves) remove skin seeds and veins.
10. Chop the poblanos and add to bowl with onion tomatoes and garlic.
11. In a skillet heat enough oil to cover generously the bottom of the skillet.  Fry tortilla strips in the oil until golden brown (fry a little bit at a time; it is both easier to control and gives more even browning).
12. Drain tortilla strips on some paper toweling to remove excess grease.
13. In the same oil sauté onion tomatoes garlic and poblanos until onion turns translucent.
14. Chop or shred chicken (is a matter of preference) then add to skillet with vegetables.  Simmer for 5-10 minutes stirring occasionally.
15. Add tomato sauce and tomato paste as well as all spices to the chicken broth.  Bring to a boil.
16. Add vegetables from skillet and about one handful of cilantro (set remaining cilantro aside to use as a garnish if you choose) to the broth.
17. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until cilantro turns black in color.  Crush up approximately ¾ of the tortilla strips in a Ziploc bag until they are like bread crumbs then add to pot.
18. Simmer until tortilla strips dissolve stirring occasionally.  When tortilla strips are dissolved you are finished and ready to plate.
19. Serving suggestions are to shred some Monterey Jack cheese and chop up some avocado more onion and cilantro.  Place these items along with some of the remaining tortilla strips on top of a piping hot bowl of soup.,

instructions, 1. NOTE: Mexican chocolate is very unlike American forms of chocolate looking like baking chocolate but sweetened grainy and brittle.  It is used to make hot chocolate.  If you can't find it substitute 2 squares of unsweetened baking chocolate.
2. NOTE: Mama Rosa always used chicken parts with skin and bones which no doubt added flavor to the sauce.  However we prefer boneless and skinless chicken breasts that really soak up the sauce.
3. Toast the first six ingredients in a dry skillet until just browned/smokey.
4. In a large shallow fry pan fry the poblano and negro chiles in just enough oil to coat the pan until the chiles are pliant and the skins begin to blister.
5. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the pan to cool until it is safe to add liquid (trust me if it's too hot it's a burn hazard!) then add just enough chicken broth to cover.
6. Soak the chiles until they are soft keeping the broth hot but not boiling.  This doesn't require constant heat just occasional to keep the temperature up.  They will soften just as well in cold broth it just takes a lot longer.
7. Chop the next four ingredients (tomato tomatillos onion and garlic) and saute in a small amount of oil over medium heat until cooked through but not browned.
8. While the vegetables are cooking put the soaked chiles in a blender adding just enough of the soaking broth to process and blend until smooth.
9. Add the tomato mixture and toasted seeds adding just enough broth to process and blend until smooth.
10. Add chocolate adding just enough broth to process and blend until smooth.
11. Strain the mixture and set aside.
12. Coat the bottom of a fry pan with oil and heat over a medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and brown on both sides.
13. Lower the heat and add enough of the mole to cover the chicken only about half way.  Cover the pan and cook turning the chicken occasionally until cooked through.
14. Serve with rice pilaf such as  recipe #395219 - Oft Requested Rice Pilaf.,

instructions, 1. Position a rack as close to the broiler as possible and heat the broiler. Arrange the tomatillos fresh chiles (if using) onion slices and garlic in a small shallow baking pan. Broil turning to ensure even cooking until the tomatillos are soft and slightly blackened about 10 minutes. Transfer the broiled ingredients to a blender and add the cilantro (if you’re using a canned chipotle add it now too). Blend until smooth.
2. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the tomatillo mixture and cook stirring for 2 to 3 minutes. Add 2 cups of the broth and simmer until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon about 20 minutes. Taste the sauce. It should be a little tart but it shouldn’t make your mouth pucker. If it’s too tart add more broth and simmer until the sauce thickens again. Remove from the heat and whisk in the crème fraîche or heavy cream and the salt. Let cool slightly before making the enchiladas.
3. Make Ahead Tips.
4. The sauce can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to a month.
5. Fill a medium saucepan with water and bring it to a boil. Add the chicken thighs and a bit of salt; simmer until cooked through and tender about 20 minutes. Cool the meat; shred (discarding any fat or gristle) season with salt and set aside.
6. Fill a large skillet with enough oil to submerge a tortilla (between 1/4 and 1/2 inch). Warm the oil over medium heat until a drop of water sizzles immediately. Fry each tortilla briefly in the oil about 10 seconds per side. Use a spatula rather than tongs to flip the tortillas as they’ll tear easily. The tortilla should stay soft; if it starts to harden it has been in the oil too long. Drain on paper towels.
7. Heat the oven to 400°F With a pastry brush spread a thin layer of sauce on both sides of each tortilla. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of shredded chicken just off center of each tortilla and roll into loose cylinders. Set the enchiladas side by side in a 9x13 inch baking dish pour the remaining sauce over them top with the cheeses and bake until bublling and browned in spots 15 to 20 minutes.,

instructions, 1. Dry Rub  --  Mix all the ingredients in a small ziploc baggie and store until ready to use. I keep mine right in a small baggie in my spice cabinet but you can use a small tupperware or spice bottle. It keeps great in your pantry or spice cabinet.
2. Chicken  --  Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to a large baggie along with chicken and shake to coat all the chicken with the oil.  Add in the 2-21/2 tablespoons of the dry rub seasoning and shake well to combine well. Let marinate.
3. Skewer  --  I like to use the large wooden skewers and alternate chicken mango or papaya red pepper if you are adding that and onion. Just leave a little room in between the chicken pieces so they cook evenly. Don't over fill your skewer.
4. Grill  --  I always season my grill with either a non stick spray or oil before starting so the chicken will not stick.  Medium high coals or heat. They don't take to long. Make sure to get a good sear or grill marks on each side before turning. Mine usually take about 5-7 minutes per side. Cook until the juices run clear. Don't overcook.
5. Serve  --  I usually start the queso sauce right before I start grilling the chicken so it is done when the chicken is.  Serve the chicken over rice with the lime wedges so you can squeeze the lime right over the chicken. My Black Beans Recipe listed above (which can even be made the day before) is great with this and makes an easy dinner or my Salad with Lime Vinaigrette(also listed above) is a nice side and again (prepare the vinaigrette ahead) so it is just a few ingredients and you have a quick salad. ENJOY!

instructions, 1. Chop onion and fry until tender. Add diced chicken and indian paste. Cook until the chicken is well cooked. If using korma add coconut cream or you could add a little water to stop it sticking to the pan.
2. While the chicken is cooking warm the wraps in a low oven (about 150 degrees celcius for 15 minutes). Enclose the wraps in tin foil to hold the moisture.
3. Once the wraps are warm and the chicken is cooked spread a little hummus on one 1/2 of the burrito wraps. I usually dish these up 1 at a time to make it easier. Put your chicken in the middle of your tortilla making sure you dont use too much of the sauce or it gets messy to eat. Place yogurt (if desired) on the chicken the fill the wrap with all your favourite salads vegetables. We use lettuce grated carrot and diced tomato. Gently wrap together and secure with a toothpick.
4. A good alternative to wrapping is to spread hummus on one side of the wrap and stack chicken and salad vegetables with the option of a second wrapper on top.
5. Rolled these can be finger food but beware it can get messy.,

2. Combine the chiles and 3 of the onion halves in a food processor; add the cilantro lime juice 1/4 t of the salt and a grinding of the pepper; process until finely chopped.
3. Gently loosen the skin form the breast and leg protions of the chicken; stuff the chile mixture evenly under the skin.
4. Sprinkle the inside of the chicken with the remaining 1/4 t salt and another grinding of the pepper; add the remaining onion half and truss* the chicken. Place the chicken breast side up in the roasting pan. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the inner thigh registers 180* F 2 - 2 1/2 hours. Let stand 10 minutes before carving. Remove and discard the onion and skin. Scrape off and discard the chile mixture before eating if desired. Serve warm.
5. *Trussing the chicken gives it a neater appearance when it comes out of the oven. To truss cut a 30-inch length of kitchen twine. Tie the legs together at the ankles with the center of the twine then loop each end around its corresponding wing at the elbow point. Pull the ends of the twine over the lower third of the breast to join them; tie them as tightly as possible.,

instructions, 1. Add 1 tbsp of olive oil to your soup pot let heat on medium heat for about 3 minutes prior to adding chicken.
2. Salt and pepper chicken breasts. I like to cut the cooking time down so I slice my chicken in half to thin it out. Sprinkle with cumin on both sides and add chicken to the pan. Cook until both sides are golden brown (chicken does not need to fully cook on the inside because it will be added to hot broth.).
3. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside for at least 10 minutes to cool prior to cutting in thin slices.
4. Cut up celery bell pepper onion and jalapeño and add to the pan on medium heat. Let this cook for about 5 minutes prior to adding the corn. Cut the corn off the cobb and add to the hot pan. Let all veggies cook for 10 minutes on medium heat.
5. Chop up the two chipotle peppers and add to the pan with the one teaspoon of the sauce that covers the peppers. Let cook for two minutes prior to adding the can of crushed tomatoes.
6. Let this all simmer together for 2 minutes and then add the box of chicken broth.
7. Add in 2 tbsps of the chopped cilantro and let soup boil for about 3 minutes. Bring soup down to a simmer for about 20 minutes to let the flavors melt together.

You have to keep doing it until you get it perfect.  I have been making this for about 25+ years and sometimes it comes out perfect sometimes is still needs something!

instructions, 1. First I tossed some chicken breast in a pan with some olive oil onions and green pepper. While that started to sizzle up I measured out some brown rice and put equal amounts of chicken broth (I almost always do this to my rice as it gives it soooo much flavor). I also added a dash of cumin salt and pepper to taste and about 3 tbs. of salsa (Rotel or diced tomatoes would work also). Then I covered it up and let it simmer on low.  (Depending on the type of rice the amount of time changes.).
2. Once the chicken was cooked all the way Jason helped me shred it -- WARNING unless you have no nerves in your fingers like Jason wait till that chicken cools down a little. The Shredded Chicken goes back in the pan along with some the Taco seasoning and a cup of water. I also add a little bit of cumin because I love it. When the water thickens up to more of a sauce texture scoop the chicken into tortillas. I always use the whole wheat kind.
3. You can squish the wraps together to make more enchiladas if you have more people coming over for just the two of us I made 3 and we had leftovers (they end up being big and filling).
4. Next I pour enchilada sauce over the top which helps to keep them moist and is relatively low in fat (I only used about 1/2 the can). Sprinkle with some reduced fat shredded cheese and scallions and into the oven they go.
5. Bake until bubbly at 375 degrees for about 15-20 minutes.
6. I served mine with the brown taco rice and some black beans. YUMMY!,

instructions, 1. Place the chicken breasts and bouillon cube in a sauce pan. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Simmer the chicken for 45 minutes to an hour until tender enough to shred.
2. While the chicken is cooking heat the oil in a saute pan add the onions. Saute for 5 minutes on medium heat or until onions are soft and translucent.
3. Add in the tomatoes and cook until mushy about 10 minutes.  Add in the garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Then using a bean or potato masher mash the tomatoes until they are broken up (about 10 good mashes).  Add the oregnao salt to taste.  Then turn the heat off of the tomatoes and set them aside.
4. Pull the meat out of the sauce pan and set aside to cool.
5. In a large bowl combine the fresh masa corn flour and white flour.  Once all is combined add ¼ cup water at a time until dough is easy to knead and slightly sticky.  I usually add around ½ to 1/3 cups water.
6. Add in the salt and knead the dough for 2 minutes to make sure the salt is incorporated.
7. Shape the dough into egg size balls and flatten slightly into discs.
8. Shred the chicken into thin shreds and add it to the tomato mixture. Stir and set aside.
9. Press each disc in a tortilla press or between two sheets of plastic until it is flat and around  ¼ inch thick.
10. As you press each empanada fill with approx 1 tbsp of the chicken mixture on one side then fold the other side over and press the edges together.  Then peel away the plastic and drop the empanada in oil for frying.
11. I serve these with salsa chile de arbol sour cream and shredded lettuce.  Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare a 9 x 13 baking dish by spraying with non-stick coking spray.
2. Chop the cooked chicken into small bite-size pieces.
3. Combine chicken cheese and sour cream until well blended.
4. Scoop about 1/4 cup chicken mixture into the center of each tortilla.  Roll the tortillas into a cigar-shape enclosing the chicken filling.  Lay close together in the baking dish seam side down.
5. Saute the minced onion and garlic in the oil over medium heat. When the garlic is fragrant and the onion has softened add 2 cups chicken broth and bring to a boil.
6. Add the can of rotel with all of the juice.  While the mixture returns to the boil combine the cornstarch with the remaining chicken broth mix well then stir into rotel mixture.  Simmer for a couple of minutes to cook out the raw cornstarch and thicken the mixture.
7. Spoon the hot sauce over the rolled tortillas making sure to cover all of the tortillas (don't leave any dry spots or they may burn).
8. Place the pan in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes or until the sauce is bubbly and the tortillas are hot throughout.
9. Feel free to adjust the seasoning in the chicken mixture and/or the sauce to your taste.  I like to use the rotel tomatoes with cilantro and lime. Sometimes I saute sliced fresh jalapenos or serranos with the onion when making the sauce etc.  Depends on my mood when I make it.  The cheese and sour cream usually make the filling salty enough for me but I often add cayenne or chili powder and black pepper if I want a bit of bite.  Sometimes I use pepper-jack cheese for all or part of the cheese in the filling.,

2. Take your chicken broth and bring to boil.  Place the chicken breasts in the broth and boil until just done.  Turn off the heat and let rest while you cut up your veggies.
3. Take the chicken out of the broth and let cool on a separate plate.
4. Heat the broth up and add in your corn.  After you cut the kernels from the cob with a spoon scrape the cob and get all of the remaining juices and small bottom parts of the corn.  Add all of this to the broth and bring to a slight boil.
5. In another pan add a couple of tablespoons of canola oil and sweat down the onions jalapenos and bell peppers.  After the onions have become slightly translucent turn up the heat to brown the mixture some.  Add the diced tomatoes to this mixture and heat through.
6. Add the slightly browned veggies to the broth and corn.  Add all of the spices listed and bring to a boil letting it simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.
7. While the veggies are simmering take the chicken breasts and shread with your fingers.
8. Add the shreaded chicken to the pot and boil for another 15 minutes.  Turn off the heat and let sit about 5 minutes before serving.
9. If you think the soup needs more fluid you may add some more water or chicken broth.  Sometimes I add a half a can of beer to the liquids because it adds a nice flavor but this is optional.

instructions, 1. In a small bowl mix together all the marinade ingredients.
2. Heat one side of a bass grill to medium. If you have a grill with charcoal let it burn until the charcoal is covered with white ash and about medium hot.
3. While the grill is heating remove the giblets (if there are any) from the cavity of the chicken. Flip the chicken onto its breast. using poultry shears cut down both sides of the backbone from tail to neck; discard backbone (or sometimes I save to make homemade stock!).
4. Open the bird onto your work surface breast side up. Make sure that the legs returned inward. Using your fist or mallet wallop the bird on the breast hard enough to dislodge the bones and flatten out the breast. (Reserve a little to baste with while cooking.
5. Smear both slides of the chicken with the marinade. Lay over indirect heat on the grill. Cook basting from time to time with remaining marinade until the juices run clear when a thigh is pierced deeply with a fork. If cooking on a gas grill it will take about 45 minutes if only a charcoal grill more like 1 hour 15 minutes - 1 hour 30 minutes depending on size of chicken.
6. About 10 minutes before the chicken is ready put the knob onions on the grill turning frequently until softened and browned.,

2. Add the fajita seasoning to the skillet and the amount of water specified on the back of the taco seasoning package. Cook until the sauce thickens and begins to boil; set aside.
3. Heat another medium non-stick skillet between medium-low and medium. Run one of the tortillas (both sides) through water quickly to just get the tortilla wet (this will ensure crispy/soft tortillas). Place the tortilla on the skillet for about 5-10 seconds on one side then flip.
4. Cover the tortilla with a layer of colby jack cheese then the chicken mixture then cheddar cheese. Run another flour tortilla through water just one side this time and place on top (wet side up) of the cheddar cheese.
5. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the cheddar cheese begins to melt (sometimes covering with a lid helps) then flip onto the other side (quickly so the inside of the quesadilla does not fall out). You may have to press down on the top tortilla while flipping so that the inside does not fall out. Cook until all the cheese is melted.
6. Slice (a pizza cutter works great) and serve with salsa sour cream and guacamole.,

Too much heat for too long will reduce the activity of garlic's health-promoting compounds. Adding garlic last will help to retain all of garlic's wonderful health benefits.
2. *Make your own taco seasoning by combining 2 tsp minced onion or onion powder 1 tsp each salt and chili powder 1/2 tsp each cumin garlic powder and red pepper flakes and 1/4 tsp oregano.

9. Note # 2:If you can find Chi-Chi's taco seasoning mix these will be To Die For.  But unfortunately I can't find this seasoning anymore.  They used to advertise right on the package that it didn't contain the "red stuff".  I use other taco seasoning mixes but none compare to the goodness that Chi-Chi's had.  If you can find Chi-Chi's somewhere use 2 pkg's because each pkg. was about 1 /2 - 3/4 ounces.  If you do find it let me know because I'd love to know because I've been searching for a long time.,

instructions, 1. Sauce  --  Make the avocado sauce ahead of time and set in the refrigerator to chill.  I like to use my mini food processor for this or a blender will work fine.  Add the avocado milk lime juice sour cream jalapeno and cilantro.  Blend until smooth.  Check for seasoning salt and pepper and adjust as needed. Remove to a small bowl and cover and chill until ready to serve. This sauce is serve cold.
2. Chicken  --  Remove to the counter along with the salsa and eggs.  You want them to be room temp or at least have the chill taken off them.
3. Tortilla Chips  --  Add the tortillas to the food processor and grind until fine chopped.  The finer chopped the easier it is. A rough chop or hand chop will not work.
4. Dredging Stations  --  1: Flour salt and pepper.  2: Eggs lightly beaten  mixed with salsa.  3: Ground tortilla chips.
5. Cheese  --  Cut a thin slice about 1/2 of the way through one side of the chicken breast (making a pocket) as you will be stuffing it with the cheese.  Make sure not to cut all the way through to the other side. But make a nice slice so you can stuff it with a fair amount of cheese. About 2 tablespoons per chicken breast. Stuff the chicken breast and secure with a single toothpick.
6. Chicken  --  Dredge the chicken in the flour and make sure to shake off any extra. Next dip in the egg and salsa mix and last into the tortilla chips.
7. Saute  --  In a large NON STICK pan (I prefer non stick for this but one that is oven proof) and heat to medium high heat.  Add enough oil to just lightly cover the bottom of the pan.  Saute on each side until golden brown. I transfer the pan (if oven proof) to the oven if not transfer to a pie plate and finish cooking in a 400 degree oven until the juices run clear. Approximately 10 minutes. It really depends on the thickness of your chicken.
8. Serve  --  Garnish the chicken with the avocado sauce some beans rice anything you want.  The avocado sauce is really good with this. Even serve this over some crisp romaine onion and black beans and use the avocado sauce as the dressing.  You can really serve it lots of way.
9. ENJOY!,

instructions, 1. Saute onion garlic and peppers in olive oil until browned.
2. Add in herbs vegetable cube pumpkin and a cup or two of water.  You want to dissolve the vegetable cube and thin the sauce so that is like the tomato sauce you'd normally use to make lasagna. The water in this will also hydrate the pasta so don't skimp! Adjust heat so that sauce simmers and flavor develops.  Taste and adjust for salt.
3. Grate Jack cheese.  You can also use pepper Jack or mozarella or cheddar even.
4. Chop chicken.  You can also used a nice quality smoked chicken deli meat too.
5. In a large bowl mix ricotta with herbs and eggs.  Thin with milk if necessary to make it spreadable.
6. Assembly:  Pour a small amount of sauce to cover the bottom of a 9X13 pan.  Lay the dry pasta sheets on top (I find that I never have to cook or soak my noodles whatever the brand--just make sure you have sufficient liquid in the dish).  Smear the ricotta mixture on top of the dry pasta sheets sprinkle chicken on top of that the grated cheese on top of that and then spoon half your jar of salsa over that.  Then add another more generous layer of the pumpkin sauce. Then pasta ricotta chicken jack salsa and/or pumpkin.  The last layer should be pumpkin sauce sprinkled with the grated cheese.
7. I find that lasagna can be a little tricky with regard to the quantity of ingredients you have.  Coming up short or with too much this or that has to do with how thickly you layer things and the depth of your pan.  I do know that you don't really want to end with a layer of pasta noodles because they'll just stay hard and that if you only give yourself a centimeter clearance from the top you should probably place the pan on a cookie sheet before it goes into the over because it will likely boil over!  I often keep a small pan off to the side so I can improvise with any leftovers.
8. Cover and bake in a 350 (180) degree oven until bubbly and cheese is melted--around 45 minutes.  Uncover to brown the top or if at the start it seems too watery to you go ahead and bake it uncovered the whole time.
9. Serve with sour cream and pickled jalapenos if you like.,

instructions, 1. Brown your beef and drain the fat. Follow package directions on taco seasoning to season beef. Let cool to room temperature.
2. In a small bowl mix the beans with taco sauce. The reason I put taco sauce in the beans is to make them a little less stiff and easier to scoop off the bottom of the dish. Use your best judgement.
3. Spread the bean mixture evenly on the bottom of a 13x9 dish. This dish should be at least 1 1/2 inches deep.
4. Sprinkle 2 cups of the cheese on top of the bean mixture.
5. Sprinkle room temperature beef on top of cheese. Make sure it is not hot at all!
6. Carefully spread sour cream on top of beef very slowly. To make it easier you might choose to dollop it in different places and use a spatula. This is the trickiest part.
7. On top of sour cream add your salsa and spread evenly.
8. Sprinkle the rest of the cheese over the top.
9. Top with green onions tomatoes and jalapenos if desired.
10. You may serve this dish right away or you can chill it for a couple of hours and serve cold. It is excellent either way!,

2. Add taco seasoning and beef broth and simmer for 15 minutes. This will infuse a lot of flavour into the ground beef. Meanwhile add remaining ingredients to the crockpot. You can add the liquid from the beans or not - I did.
3. Add ground beef mixture to the crockpot. If you find that there isn't enough liquid add more beef broth. I cooked it on low for 6 hours but I can't imagine why it can't be cooked longer. The longer you cook soups in a crockpot the better they taste!
4. If you can taste the soup partway through you may want to season it to your tastes at this point. Add some freshly ground pepper chili powder or any of your favourite spices or seasonings.
5. Top with grated cheese and diced avocado and tortilla chip pieces if you wish.,

instructions, 1. Heat oven to 325°F Spray non-stick baking spray on 3 round cake pans. Separate eggs and place yolks in a large mixing bowl. Reserve whites in a separate mixing bowl.
2. Add sugar to yolks and beat on high speed with an electric mixer until pale yellow and fluffy about 5 minutes. Clean beaters and whip egg whites to medium peaks about 5 minutes.
3. Using a rubber spatula stir about 1/3 of the egg whites into the yolk mixture to lighten it. Then gently fold in remaining whites.
4. Whisk flour with a dry whisk to aerate and break up any lumps then sprinkle it over egg mixture. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold flour into egg mixture just until there are no more white flour streaks. Don’t overmix.
5. Pour batter into the prepared cake pans and bake until cakes are puffed and golden and the edges pull away from the sides of the pans about 20 to 25 minutes.
6. Remove cakes from the oven and place on a wire cooling rack. Allow to cool for a bit before trying to turn them out. When turning them out of the pan if they stick a bit gently run a knife around the edge of the cake to free it from the pan.
7. Once the cakes are turned out with a toothpick poke holes all over the cakes (A LOT OF HOLES). Allow to cool for 15 minutes.
8. In the meantime in a medium bowl whisk together the sweetened condensed milk the evaporated milk the coconut cream and 1/4 cup rum.
9. Take the bottom cake layer and place it on a large plate or cake plate (you can't move this cake once it's assembled so pick something with a little room around the edges because some liquid will collect at the bottom.).
10. Pour 1 cup of the milk mixture over the layer. Then sprinkle the top of the layer with flaked coconut and add second layer. Pour 1 cup of milk mixture over the layer sprinkle with flaked coconut and add the final layer. For the final layer pour the rest of the mixture over the entire cake.
11. Continue cooling cake about 45 minutes more spoon any collected milk mixture back onto the cake and then cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.
12. To decorate whip cream powdered sugar and 4 tablespoons of rum to medium peaks (you want it to be relatively stiff.).
13. Gently ice cake with the whipped cream. The cake will be very soft so use care to avoid damaging the layers.
14. Toast flaked coconut in a large frying pan over medium heat. Cook stirring often until coconut is lightly toasted and browned. If coconut begins to burn reduce heat. Remove from the pan immediately.
15. Sprinkle toasted coconut in a layer on the top of the cake. Then garnish with chopped mango strawberry kiwi and any other fruit you like.,

2. Whisk together lime juice and olive oil.
3. Rub chicken well with lime/oil mix.  Do not marinate.
4. Coat chicken with dry seasoning/spice mixture.  The idea here is to get as much as possible to stick to the chicken.  We store our seasoning in a leftover spice container with large sprinkle holes and use that to season.  This is not a rub so it should not be applied in rub fashion.
5. Refrigerate 1-3 hours then remove from refrigerator and allow to come to near room temperature.
6. Prepare grill for direct/indirect grilling.
7. Grill chicken over hot direct fire. Don't worry about the black it's supposed to be there.  In fact 30-40% of the skin should end up black but it will not be bitter.
8. Once seared remove to the indirect heat area of the grill and cook to 165* internal temperature.
9. One quick dance across the direct heat before serving will help crisp it a bit.
10. Serve with plenty of napkins.,

instructions, 1. Chicken: Halve the chicken breasts lengthwise. Cut the halves into fingerthick pieces.
2. Mix oil and curry paste and marinate chicken for at least 30 minutes. It can be marinated up to 24 hours in advance. The longer you marinate it the better it will taste.
3. Heat a nonstick skillet or wok (high heat) and add the chicken pieces but not the marinade left in the dish you marinated the chicken in as you will need it to toss your onions in it. However most marinade will stick to the chicken which is ok. You don't need to add extra oil as there should be enough oil in the marinade. Cook the chicken in a single layer without stirring for ca 40seconds on the first side; turn the chicken pieces and cook for only 30seconds on the second side. Transfer the chicken to a clean bowl.
4. Preheat oven to 350F/180°C.
5. Onion spices rice: Toss onions in dish with leftover marinade of the chicken. Heat oil in same skillet/wok you used for chicken. Fry onions on low heat for 4 minutes stirring frequently. Add garlic ginger cinnamon stick and chili if using. Cook for another 2 minutes. Stir in washed and drained rice and cook for 1 minute. Take off heat and add raisins and transfer to a casserole dish with a lid or use a wok or wide pan with lid.
6. Flavoured stock: Mix ingredients for flavoured stock and heat it. Check seasoning. When hot mix with rice and cover. Put in preheated oven.
7. Cook for 20 minutes then stir in cooked chicken and cherry tomatoes if using. Cook for another 10 minutes or until rice and chicken are done.
8. Serve: Sprinkle each serving with coconut and top with lime wedge. The lime wedge is lovely if pressed over curry! Serve with sour cream aside if desired.,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 180/350 degrees/gas 4. Put the ham in a large roasting pan with all of the poaching ingredients. Add water until it comes halfway up the side of the pan. Cover the ham with tinfoil ( making a tent over the ham to allow the steam to circulate).
2. Bake for two hours or until pink and cooked through remove from the oven and let cool for 30 minutes remaining covered.
3. While your ham poaches add the bay leaves and the dry spices to a food processor with the garlic cloves. Whizz it to form a paste then add the onions and chillies and whizz again.Pour in the rum and malt vinegar and keep whizzing while adding the thyme. Once it has a nice loose consistency the marinade is ready.
4. When the ham has had it's 30 mins out of the oven transfer it to a roasting tray and let it cool down a bit. While it's still warm put your hand underneath the skin and gently pull it away from the meat leaving a bit of the fat underneath attached. Then with a sharp knife score the ham by lightly making diagonal cuts across the leg.
5. Spoon the marinade over the pork (using the back of a spoonit's hot stuff!) and into the scored fat. If you want to use your hands to rub it in PLEASE wear gloves!
6. You can cover the ham with cling film and chill it overnight if you wish or cook right away.
7. Pour a small glass of water into the bottom of the roasting tray and put the ham into the preheated oven for 2 hours (350/180 degrees). Try to baste it every 30 mins or so to get it good and dark.
8. After the two hours are up scrape a bit of the marinade off with a spatula ans spoon about 3/4 jar of marmalade over it and a good swig of rum on top. Smear this mixture all over the ham and let it drip down the sides too. Spoon the juices off the bottom of the pan back over the ham and put it back in the oven for another 30 minutes basting every 5-7 minutes to build up the crust.
9. When it's lovely and dark it's done!,

2. Add broccoli cauliflower and nuts to coleslaw mix.
3. When chopping the dehydrated pineapple soak it with the lime juice to re-hydrate it as you chop when you have it all chopped run through it with your knife a little to mix in the lime juice and soften the pineapple.
4. Shake/Mix your ingredients.
5. Then add mayo yogurt and dressing shake/mix again.
6. **Lastly add your vinegar and seasonings shake/mix.
7. Refrigerate and enjoy!
8. Note: using a combination of mayo yogurt and dressing keeps this tangy but not too sweet.
9. ** I also used: 1/4 t. "Orange Pepper" ("Dean Jacob's" brand in a grinder).
10. ** And 1/4-1/2 t. "Caribbean Rub" ("The Spice Hunter" brand)  however I just looked online for it and apparently they don't make it anymore but it contains: (paprika mace ginger garlic onion pepper allspice fennel bay leaf thyme) if you can try to create your own or find something similar. There are a few good Caribbean rub recipes on this website that come  pretty close to the same ingredients. Besides who can deny that having a good Caribbean rub on hand hurts. This system did not recognize this ingredient so I could not add it under the ingredients section. I have to say that the savory taste of the Caribbean rub made this salad so it's definitely worth the effort of making or finding a good Caribbean rub.
11. Of course this can be doubled or tripled for a great party/potluck salad.,

instructions, 1. Prepare Green seasoning marinade:
2. Put all the seasoning ingredients into your blender or food processor and process dry or with a minimum amount of water. Store in the fridge in a glass jar for up 2-3 days or longer if you add water and some vinegar  Sorry I can't offer definite measurements. I usually just eyeball this.
3. Trinidadians use this all purpose mix to season just about any kind of meat. It keeps well in the fridge and we will generally make a fresh batch of this once a week.
4. Season chicken with Angustora bitters 5 tablespoons of green seasoning 1/2 tsp salt and black pepper and leave to marinate in the fridge for 1/2 hour or longer if you have the time.
5. Heat oil and golden ray in a heavy pot add sugar and garlic and let caramelize. Stir once or twice so that the garlic doesn't burn.
6. The sugar will go from the colour of peanut butter to a bubbling dark reddish brown. When the outer edges start to turn an even darker brown  add all the chicken to the pot.
7. Do not stir. Let the water generated by the addtion of the chicken dry out some and give chicken a chance to caramelize. Turn chicken and let rest again for the other side to caramelize. Reapeat this process turning chicken occasionally so that it browns on all sides. If the sauce at this point looks a little bit gooey you are on the right track. You may need to add a few tablespoons of water during this process if it seems that the sauce is drying out too quickly but keep it at this thickened stage until the chicken is brown. If your sauce is too thin and watery the chicken will not caramelize.
8. TIP: It takes a while for the sugar to get to the dark colour you are looking for. Do not walk away while browning the sugar. Once brown you'd be surprised how quickly it goes to black leaving you with a bitter charred mess that dries hard and ruins your pot and your spoon:=)No this never happened to me before LOL.
9. Don't rush this stage. Let the liquid dry out turning chicken occasionally so that it browns on all sides. If water is added too soon the brown colour will wash right off. The chicken will be too pale.
10. When chicken is nice and brown about 10 mins add rice and turn often until well mixed. Add sweet peppers peas coconut milk and broth or Maggi cube and water. Taste at this point and add more salt if needed.
11. Bring to a boil. Cover pot. Lower heat and simmer until rice is cooked and all the water is evaporated. (25-30mins).
12. Add more water if rice is still hard and cook for a few more minutes.,

Try opening a chilled rosé from California with Thompson’s skewers—it’s a great outdoor summertime combination. Two to look for are Bonny Doon Vineyard’s strawberry-scented 2007 Vin Gris de Cigare or the crisp 2006 Terre Rouge Vin Gris d’Amador.,

instructions, 1. Add all ingredients to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with dough attachment OR you can do this by hand.
2. Mix until a soft dough forms.
3. If you can stand to wait thirty minutes to an hour let the dough rest and rise. If you can't wait these bake up great even if you cook them right away. But they do become rather lovely little plump pillows once they do puff up.
4. Right before cooking pat them down into relatively thin discs (about 1/4 inch thick).
5. Fry in a 1/4 inch of oil on both sides until puffy browned and cooked through. Try your heat set to medium and this should be about perfect. You might need to play around with your temperature to get it to cook through on the inside before the outside gets too dark.
6. Note:
7. You could eat them straightforward or  with a lot of icing sugar or you can put raisins dried currants little pieces of apple etc. in the dough before frying for a nice variation.,

instructions, 1. Spray a cooling rack with nonstick spray and set it in a half sheet pan lined with parchment.
2. Peel the ginger root(use the back of a spoon it gets into all the grooves) and slice into 1/8-inch thick slices using a mandoline. Place into a 4-quart saucepan with the water and set over medium-high heat. Cover and cook for 35 minutes or until the ginger is tender.
3. Transfer the ginger to a colander to drain reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid. Weigh the ginger and measure out an equal amount of sugar. Return the ginger and 1/4 cup water to the pan and add the sugar. Set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil stirring frequently. Reduce the heat to medium and cook stirring frequently until the sugar syrup looks dry has almost evaporated and begins to recrystallize approximately 20-40 minutes. Make sure you continously stir. It may feel like you've been stirring the ginger forever but when it starts to crystallize it will happen very quickly.
4. Transfer the ginger immediately to the cooling rack and spread to separate the individual pieces. Once completely cool store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. Save the sugar that drops beneath the cooling rack and use to top ginger snaps sprinkled over ice cream or to sweeten coffee.
5. Any liquid can be used to flavor tea or used for hot tea. Some people said they had to cook it longer. It's worth every minute. :).,

Or for a completely family friendly version eliminate the red pepper flakes and your stir-fry will be as mild as a tropical breeze.

9. You will now need to either 1 refrigerate the dough over night or 2 put dough in glass bowl and cover with foil TIGHTLY and freeze for approximately 2 hours pressing dough a little half way between chilling.
10. After you have chilled overnight or 20 minutes before your dough is done chilling in the freezer (DO NOT REMOVE IT FROM FREEZER UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO USE IT) you will want to start your filling.
11. Take out a nice sized pan and add your ground chicken to it.
12. Do not turn your heat on.
13. In your food processor grind your onion quarters stock peppers and freshly ground black pepper.
14. After you are done grinding add this mixture to the pan with your ground chicken and thoroughly combine making sure that you have no"chunks" of chicken left.
15. Next you will want to add your two bay leaves paprika and herbs.
16. Simmer this mixture uncovered while stirring constantly and breaking up lumps with a wooden spoon.
17. You will want to simmer the mixture until it becomes the consistancy of a moist paste and MOST of the liquid has boiled off but you want it to have a nice amount of moisture with a bit of liquid left.
18. Once the mixture is as stated remove from heat and take out your bay leaves.
19. Add the bread crumbs to the meat mixture and combine thoroughly.
20. Set mixture aside and allow it to cool.
21. Add breadcrumbs mix well and leave to cool.
22. Now you can take your dough out of the refrigerator (or freezer if you decided to freeze it).
23. WARNING: DOUGH WILL STAIN CLOTHING PLASTIC SKIN ETC.
24. BE CAUTIOUS WITH DOUGH!
25. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.
26. Roll sections of dough (size is up to you!) dough into circles to about a little over 1/8 inch thick.
27. I usually use about 2-3 heaping tablespoons worth of dough for one patty (you can make them really small for small appetizers-- its really up to you) and fill centers with meat mixture.
28. Fold dough over and crimp the edges of the pastry shut to form a moon-shaped patty.
29. You need to make sure that you do this while your dough is COLD otherwise they will not work out in your favor.
30. Put the patties on a greased baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes until pastry has browned nicely.
31. If you want you can also freeze these patties after you have formed them without baking them and then take one out pop it in a preheated oven (400F) for 30-35 minutes and you have a quick meal!
32. ENJOY!
33. If you have any questions dont be afraid to ask.,

2. In a larger bowl mix together the beef egg paprika onion garlic lime juice ketchup and the bread crumb/milk mixture.
3. Make sure it is well combined and then cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours to let the flavors come together. I left it for about 24 hours with good results.
4. Form into patties and either fry in a little olive oil or grill over hot coals (they will stick to your grill so oil well). They should be cooked through not rare (as I usually like it). We grilled them (1/2 lb burgers) for about 5-6 minutes per side.
5. Serve them on buns and top with the shoestring potatoes if desired along with a little more ketchup.,

instructions, 1. Do-ahead tip: Buy a small bag of uncooked beans and put half of the bag in a large pot fill with water almost to the top simmer over medium-low heat for 3-4 hours or test for doneness (hold one between your fingers and squeeze if it easily mashes without much pressure they're done.) Don't drain and you can keep them in a tightly sealed container for up to 2 days or you can freeze them for up to a month and thaw completely before using. These taste so much better than the canned ones but it's not going to hurt if you use those for a shortcut. If you are using canned beans it should be 2 cans.
2. In a pot heat the oil. Add oregano onion garlic tomato paste peppers salt and herbs. Stir and add two tablespoons of water. Add the beans and simmer. When the water has almost evaporated add the chicken stock cilantro and two more tablespoons of water stir.
3. Add the remaining water mashing the beans over heat. Boil at medium heat until it reaches a creamy consistency. Remove cilantro before serving. Adjust salt to taste.

2. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Add chicken and cook through.  I do it this way so the spices toast in the pan and the chicken gets a bit of a crust on it.  If it gets too dry or starts to burn turn down the heat and/or add a couple tablespoons of water/broth.  This would be great on the grill too.
3. In the meantime chop the mango avocado scallions and cilantro.  Toss together in a bowl with the lime juice and salt and pepper.  I wouldn’t recommend making this too far in advance of the meal as the avocado will start to turn brown.
4. Spoon chicken onto tortillas top with cheese and salsa.  Serve with sour cream.

instructions, 1. Marinade  --  Mix the rum citrus juice olive oil garlic ginger and red pepper flakes in a large baggie and shake well to combine the flavors.  Add the shrimp and marinade 2-3 hours. NO longer. The last 30 minutes add the pieces of onion and papaya.
2. Skewer  --  I like to use bamboo but use anything you like.  I don't find it necessary to soak the bamboo other than just a minute or two.  The shrimp is so quick cooking just a quick soak or rinse if fine for me. Alternate shrimp papaya onion and just keep going.  Don't over crowd the skewer. That way each item cook all the way through.  Season with salt and pepper.  Any leftover marinade I just reheat in the microwave and then use to brush on the skewers as they grill.
3. Grilling  --  After making your skewers let them set and come to room temp before grilling.  They can be grilled outside charcoal or gas or can be done inside on a grill pan.  NOW  --  make the rice  --
4. Rice  --  Bring the water coconut and salt to a boil and add the rice.  Most recipes will take about 15 minutes to cook covered. Just follow the recipe on the package.  Each rice brand can take different times.  Once light and fluffy add the cilantro and any salt and pepper is needed.
5. Serve the skewers over the coconut rice.  I love to serve this with simple sauteed sugar snap peas.  A little butter red pepper flakes salt and pepper. 3-4 minutes and serve. But use any veggie you enjoy. Bok Choy pan seared is also great with this.,

instructions, 1. Mix the flour and salt together. Add the margarine and rub in until resembles coarse breadcrumbs.
2. Add vinegar.
3. Add water slowly mixing until it forms a soft dough. If it's not becoming a dough be patient. If it STILL isn't add a little more water but not too much or the pastry will become tough.
4. Cover in cling wrap and refrigerate for at least two hours.
5. Meanwhile chop the apples up. It helps to chop them up finely or to throw them in a food processor.
6. Place them in a large sauce pan with the water and lemon juice and cinnamon and sugar (if using. If n using caramel topping don't add now). Bring to the boil. Simmer on high heat for about 10 minutes or until soft.
7. When soft sift in cornflour. If you like it thicker add more cornflour. Stir in quickly turn off heat and allow to thicken still stirring.
8. If using caramel Stir in now.
9. Set topping aside to cool.
10. Preheat the oven to 200°C.
11. Lightly spray 3 baking trays with vegetable oil spray.
12. Take out the pastry. Break off a piece with your hand a bit larger than the size of a golf ball. Roll it with your hands gently so that it becomes soft. Flatten it into a small disc.
13. Using a medium sized plate place the dough disc onto it and gently stretch and push the dough in to make it become flatter until it's about 1/4 inch thick. Remember it's supposed to be a circle. You don't really need to use the plate I just find it helps a lot.
14. Place about 1-2 heaped tablespoons of filling on one side of the disc. Brush the edges with egg and fold over one side to create a semi-circle. Pinch shut gently and press a fork into the edges for presentation.
15. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Place evenly on the trays. I fit about four per tray but yours might be different.
16. Brush one side with remaining egg and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar if so desired.
17. Bake for about 15-20 minutes or until lightly golden.,

3. The oil is ready when it bubbles as soon as a piece of plantain is slid into it.Add plantain slicescooking about 1 plantain at a time.When they begin to brown around the edgesturn them and cook until very dark.They should look almost burnt because the sugars in the plantains are caramelized.

instructions, 1. Make the crust: Combine flour 1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder and pinch of salt. Cut in 1/4 cup margarine and shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water until mixture forms a ball. Do not overstir; that makes tough crust.  Shape dough into a log and cut into 10 equal sections. Roll each section into a six inch circle (approximately 1/8 inch thick). Set aside.
2. Next prepare the filling.: Melt margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion until soft and translucent. Stir in ground beef. Season with 1 teaspoon curry powder thyme 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. Cook until beef is browned stirring constantly. Stir in beef broth and bread crumbs. Simmer until liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat.
3. Now make the patties:  Spoon some filling into each pastry circle. Fold over and press edges together making a half circle. Use a fork to press edges and brush the top of each patty with beaten egg.
4. Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for 25 - 30 minutes or until golden brown.
5. NOTE:  If you have the time and organization it might be best to make the filling in advance long enough to cool down before fillng the pastry.  Otherwise it might melt the pastry somewhat.  Just a thought from a review on another recipe.,

2. Peel (or wash and leave un-peeled) and dice potatoes into 1/2 inch chunks and set aside.
3. Peel and finely chop onion and set aside.
4. Add oil onions and ginger puree to a"cold" large non-stick Dutch oven pan or large pot and set heat to medium.
5. Stir-fry for about 8-10 minutes or until the onion is golden and even slightly browned.
6. Add garlic and stir-fry for another 3 minutes being careful not to burn the garlic.
7. Add 3 heaping Tbs. of the curry powder to the pot and stir in with the garlic ginger salt and onions for 1 minute more.
8. Add 3/4 cup of the chicken stock and bring to a low boil.
9. Add the chicken and stir an additional few minutes to 'sear' the chicken.
10. Place the diced potatoes on top of the chicken pieces and then add the remaining chicken stock to the pan 1 cup at a time as necessary until the potatoes are"covered" by the liquid.
11. Add more curry powder if desired ( --  and I always desire) along with the garam masala and the cinnamon stick.
12. Mix in gently.
13. Make sure that the potatoes are still "covered" by the liquid.
14. Bring heat down to medium low.
15. Cook uncovered until the potatoes are fork tender (about 20 minutes).
16. Do not overcook the chicken or potatoes!
17. After 15 minutes (approx.) turn heat down to low and add the rest of any additional curry powder that you desire the cayenne more salt (you'll find that the potatoes have taken a lot of the salt away and the sauce may now be a bit bland).
18. Remove cinnamon stick mix well and continue to cook on low for an additional 5-10 minutes.
19. Turn off heat and taste.
20. Adjust seasonings if needed.
21. If the curry sauce is too thin at this point simply remove some of the potatoes from the pot and mash them with a fork in a small bowl then return the mashed potatoes to the pot and stir in gently.
22. The mashed potato will now act as a sauce thickener.
23. Serve on a white plate atop basmati or long grain rice.
24. Garnish the white plate with a dusting of paprika around its edge.
25. Sprinkle toasted shaved almonds on top of the curry.
26. Let ‘Uncle Rick’ know how it turns out!
27. NOTE:  Homemade chicken stock honestly DOES make a difference!
28. And… by the way  --.
29. This dish is even better the next day  --  and the day after that.,

instructions, 1. I use 1 pound jumbo shrimp precooked frozen peeled and deveined tails can be either on or off.
2. The most important thing to remember with this recipe is to completely thaw the precooked frozen shrimp in a colander. When most of the water drains off pat dry the shrimp as much as possible with paper towels. (Or start with fresh peeled deveined shrimp precooked. A lot of grocers will steam them at no extra charge.).
3. Turn your burner on medium high (almost high) and set your large non stick skillet or wok over the burner. When skillet begins to get really hot but NOT smoking quickly add the melted butter and shrimp.
4. Sprinkle on the Caribbean Jerk Seasoning to taste. It's hot and spicy so be careful if you don't like the heat.
5. Keep the shrimp moving in the pan glazing the shrimp with the hot butter and spices.
6. Cook just until hot and slightly browned. (only about 3 minutes or even less depending on the heat of your skillet).
7. You can also make these in the broiler or on the grill after tossing the shrimp in melted butter sprinkling on Caribbean Jerk Seasoning and spreading them on a broiler pan or open grill. Broil for only 2 to 3 minutes watching closely.,

instructions, 1. Roughly cut up all ingredients.
2. Toss the wettest ones in a large food processor and give them a couple of quick pulses. This moistness will help process the rest of the ingredients(the tomatoes and tomatillos).
3. Next add the herbs – parsley and cilantro.
4. Then add as many of the other ingredients as you can fit.
5. Give the processor several whirs and stirs. Keep adding whatever didn’t fit before and pulse until you get a coarse blend. Some sofritos are really chunky some are like a paste. You decide.
6. Season with salt and pepper if you like but it may be best to season the dish it goes in in order to have more control.
7. Refrigerate and use as needed.,

instructions, 1. If you can find Jamaican curry powder use it and omit the allspice. If not use regular curry powder and add the allspice to it. Add 6 tbsp of curry powder more if you like it more spicy.
2. Cut the meat into large chunks maybe 2-3 inches across. Feel free to add the bones if you have them; you can remove them later.
3. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Mix in 2 tablespoons of the curry powder and heat until fragrant.
4. Pat the meat dry and brown well in the curried oil. Do this in batches and don’t overcrowd the pot. It may take a while to do this maybe 30 minutes or so. Set the browned meat aside in a bowl. (When all the meat is browned if you have bones add them and brown them too.).
5. Add the onions and pepper to the pot and sauté stirring from time to time until the onions just start to brown about 5 minutes. Sprinkle some salt over them as they cook. Add the ginger and garlic mix well and sauté for another 1-2 minutes.
6. Put the meat (and bones if using) back into the pot along with any juices left in the bowl. Mix well. Pour in the coconut milk and tomatoes and 4-5 tablespoons of the curry powder. Add 4 cups of water. Stir to combine. Add the thyme.
7. If you want to cook on the stove bring to a simmer and let it cook until the meat is falling-apart tender which will take at least 2 hours. Longer if you have a mature goat. If you want to cook in a crockpot transfer the mixture to the crockpot and cook on low for 8-10 hours.
8. If you have cooked the meat on the stove add the potatoes when the meat is close to being done - tender but not falling apart. Cook about 30 minutes or until the potatoes are done. Then skim the fat off the top of the pot if needed.
9. If you cooked the meat in the crockpot boil the potatoes until tender. Skim the layer of fat off the top of the curry if needed and mix in the potatoes.
10. If you used bones remove them before serving.,

2. Place the mango in a mini food processor and pulse till it is a pulp.
3. Scrape all of this into a bowl adding the sour cream sugar and extract.  Mix well and set aside.  Do not refrigerate this it is best served at room temperature.
4. For Chicken -- in a bowl place 1 cup plus 2 T flour and set aside.
5. In another bowl place the remaining flour (1 cup plus 2 T) sugar and salt.
6. Stir milk and extracts into this.  The mixture should resemble a thin pancake batter (you may have to add a little more milk).
7. Set this aside.
8. Place the bread slices in a food processor and pulse till you have fine crumbs measure out approx 1-1/2 cups.
9. Place these on a pie pan and place in a 350°F oven till lightly toasted and dried out.
10. Mix toasted bread crumbs in a third bowl with the coconut.
11. Preheat a deep fryer with oil according to the directions of the fryer.
12. Place a cooling rack on a large cookie sheet and cover the rack with paper towels.
13. Now one at a time drag each chicken bite through the pan with just flour then using a slotted spoon drop it into the milk mixture coat well and use the spoon to retrieve it.
14. Drop the coated bite into the coconut mixture being careful not to get to much of the excess wet mixture into the coconut. cover evenly with the coconut mixture and set on a second cookie sheet.
15. After all the chicken pieces are ready begin to cook them in the hot oil.  Just do a few at a time to keep your oil from cooling to much and becoming gummy.  The heat time will vary a great deal on this because it is raw meat and it depends on how big of chunks you make them.  Make sure they are cooked completely you may want to test the first one out and see how long it takes to get it done thoroughly.
16. I cook mine for approx 5 minutes and the batter should turn a nice golden brown.
17. Remove from oil and drain on the cookie sheet that has been prepared with paper towels.  Serve with mango cream.,

instructions, 1. Prepare Green seasoning marinade:
2. Put all the seasoning ingredients into your blender or food processor and process dry or with a minimum amount of water. Store in the fridge in a glass jar for up to a week. Or add some more water and some vinegar if you want to keep it longer. Sorry I can't offer definite measurements. I usually just eyeball this.
3. Trinidadians use this all purpose mix to season just about any kind of meat. It keeps well in the fridge and we usually make a fresh batch of this once a week.
4. Season chicken with Angustora bitters green seasoning salt and black pepper and leave to marinate in the fridge for 1/2 hour or longer if you have the time.
5. Heat oil in a heavy pot add sugar and garlic and let caramelize. Stir once or twice so that the garlic doesn't burn.
6. The sugar will go from the colour of peanut butter to a bubbling dark reddish brown. When the outer edges start to turn an even darker brown  add all the chicken to the pot.
7. Do not stir. Let the water generated by the addtion of the chicken dry out some and give chicken a chance to caramelize. Turn chicken and let rest again for the other side to caramelize. Reapeat this process turning chicken occasionally so that it browns on all sides. If the sauce at this point looks a little bit gooey you are on the right track. You may need to add a few tablespoons of water during this process if it seems that the sauce is drying out too quickly but keep it at this thickened stage until the chicken is brown. If your sauce is too thin and watery the chicken will not caramelize.
8. TIP: It takes a while for the sugar to get to the dark colour you are looking for. Do not walk away while browning the sugar. Once brown you'd be surprised how quickly it goes to black leaving you with a bitter charred mess that dries hard and ruins your pot and your spoon:=)No this never happened to me before LOL.
9. Don't rush this stage. Let the liquid dry out turning chicken occasionally so that it browns on all sides. If water is added too soon the brown colour will wash right off. The chicken will be too pale.
10. When chicken is nice and brown add the Worcestershire sauce the Maggi cube and  2 cups cup or more of water to cover the chicken or two cups of broth.
11. Add hot pepper sauce; cover pot and bring to a boil. Remove the pot cover part of the way as you want the liquid to start drying up but not so quickly that the chicken doesn't have time to cook. If liquid dries out too quickly you can always add more water.
12. Cook on medium heat until chicken is tender.
13. Once the chicken is cooked let liquid dry out until the sauce in the pot is no longer watery.
14. Serve with hot rice salad or vegetables.
15. Variations: You can add a 1/4 cup pumpkin cut in small cubes after you brown the chicken if you want a slightly thicker sauce.,

instructions, 1. Prepare a yellow butter cake straight from the box as directed and add 1 tbsp of vanilla. Bake in a 9 x 12 pan sprayed with nonstick spray.
2. While the cake is baking pour all cans of milk (condensed evaporated and coconut) into a pot on low-medium heat stirring frequently to avoid the milk from burning to the bottom of the pot.
3. It should be a bit thicker consistency than whole milk. Not too much though. If its too thick add some regular whole milk. Too thin add some more condensed milk. The flavor of the mixture should be that of a caramel taste. This should stay on the stove until the cake is out of the oven (approx 30-40 min).
4. Once the cake comes out let it cool and turn the heat off of the milk. While still warm poke holes with a toothpick all over the cake. This will allow the milk mixture to seep into the cake as you pour it on. Pour the mixture on slowly allowing the mixture to soak into the cake as much as possible. I pour on about a cup at a time until the whole mixture is in the pan along with the cake. If it doesn't seem to fit save the remaining mixture in the fridge.
5. Once the mixture is in place the cake into the fridge. This should be served cold-not frozen.
6. NOW here is the tricky part. To make the meringue icing you must be very careful or else it will flop on you.
7. Take the egg white into a bowl and with a hand held blender whip them for at least 3-5 minutes. They must be whipped at very high speed. Then VERY SLOWLY start adding in the sugar at about 3 tbsp at a time continuously whipping with the hand held. The sugar will slowly stiffen up the egg whites.  Keep adding sugar to the mixture until you are able to make stiff little mountains with the egg whites when you pull the blender out. The longer you whip it the better the odds are that they will remain fluffy and thick. Otherwise they will seem to melt away after spreading it on the cake. Just spread the meringue all over the top of the cake.
8. Cut pieces in squares and place on plate. Pour a small amount of the milk mixture on the plate around the base of the cake slice. Serve just as is or garnish with slices of strawberries or mangoes. You can also sprinkle shredded dry coconut on the top of the cake.
9. Storage: keep covered and refrigerated. Great with a cup of cappuccino.,

They add freshness and an herby note to anything you cook. Do not mistake them for Scotch bonnet or Habanero chilies (which they look like)--those two pack a wallop when it comes to heat.
