instructions, 1. The Day Before Cooking:.
2. Sprinkle your turkey with Adobo inside and out and all around.
3. Mix together the crushed garlic pepper and oregano and rub all over the turkey so it will acquire a really good taste. Place the turkey in the refrigerator until cooking. DO NOT stuff the turkey yet.
4. The day you are going to cook the turkey: Start by turning the oven on to 325º.
5. If using stuffing stuff the turkey (not the mouth) with your stuffing.
6. Place the turkey on a foil lined baking dish.
7. Coat the turkey with vegetable oil or if you prefer it can be butter.
8. Cover the whole turkey with aluminum foil and put it in the heated oven.
9. Baste the turkey from to time with the juices in the pan.
10. Cook the turkey as follows:               If your turkey is 4 to 6 pounds cook for about 3 to 3 ¾ hours.                     If your turkey is 6 to 8 pounds cook for about 3 ¾ to 4 ½ hours.                   If your turkey is 8 to 12 pounds cook for about 4 to 5 hours.                    These times are approximately because everyone has a different picky oven and I know how picky they can be. Check the turkey to see if it’s done according to the time table. It might need a little more time so leave it 15 minutes more if you think it is not done.                  Extras
11. When you are thawing the turkey in the refrigerator place it in the warmer part of the refrigerator. To thaw it even faster submerge the whole turkey with wrapping under cold water. DO NOT take the wrapping off. You want to retain the flavor. A big turkey will take approximately 2 days to thaw out in the refrigerator.,

instructions, 1. Prepare Pork for Slow Cooking (1 day):
2. Combine marinade ingredients.
3. Stab the pork all over to allow for better marinade penetration.
4. Marinade pork for 12-24 hours.
5. Remove from marinade and bring to room temperature (reserve marinade for later).
6. Heat large skillet with a small amount of olive oil until smoking hot.
7. Sear pork on all sides in skillet.
8. Leave the pan alone and keep it for cooking onions later.
9. Place pork in roasting pan and pour marinade into pan (ideally pan should be about 3 inches wider/longer then pork.).
10. Loosely tent pan with foil.
11. Slow Cook Pork (preferably use Traeger pellet grill):
12. Place in 300 degree oven (or preferably Traeger pellet grill).
13. Cook for 2 hours tented.
14. Reduce heat to 250.
15. Cook for 1 more hour uncovered basting every 20 minutes with marinade.
16. Turn Pork over and cook for 1 more hour basting every 20 minutes with marinade.
17. Your cooking time will vary depending on meat and pan size. Uncovering the pan is done to reduce the marinade. Your goal is to use most of the marinade but not to burn it. You will still have considerable burnt and caramelized pieces at the end of the cooking cycle. Re-cover the pan if necessary to preserve liquid. The pork should basically fall apart by the end of the cooking cycle.
18. Remove pork cover with foil and let sit for 30 minutes.
19. Pull the pork apart into medium sized chunks with claws.
20. Aioli (prepare while cooking pork and refrigerate):
21. Soak white bread in vinegar.
22. Place it in a kitchen aid mixer with all remaining ingredients EXCEPT olive oil.
23. Whip on medium setting until thoroughly blended.
24. Slowly drizzle in NON-Extra virgin (regular) Olive Oil.  Increase speed of the mixer as it begins to emulsify and turn into a mayonnaise-like consistency.
25. Place in refrigerator.
26. Caramelize Onions (Prepare while letting the pork rest):
27. Cut onion into thick slices (about 1/2 inch wide).
28. Heat pan used for searing pork over Medium/low heat adding a little olive oil.
29. Add onion to pan.
30. Slowly caramelize onions stirring occasionally. Onions should be soft and browned but not burnt.
31. Prepare the sandwich:
32. The original used a harder roll sliced completely in half. I use a Bahn Mi roll cut more like a Philly steak sandwich bun. I get my buns at Q Bakery in Columbia City. This allows me to stuff the sandwich and not have a complete mess.
33. Cut roll and LIGHTLY toast inside.
34. Spread Aioli generously on inside.
35. Add some cilantro a branch of romaine a few jalapeños some caramelized onions and stuff with pork.
36. Finally eat the best sandwich ever.,

instructions, 1. In a small bowl blend together the butter garlic and curry powder. Add a few dashes of hot sauce and season with salt and pepper.
2. With scissors cut down the center of the lobster tail shells on the top side and discard the dark intestinal vein. Loosen the meat from the shells and rub it with oil. Season the lobster lightly with salt and pepper. (I often don't do this step if your guests are cool).
3. Light a grill. Grill the lobster tails over a medium-hot fire meaty side down until light grill marks appear about 2 minutes. Turn the lobster tails and spread each with about 1 teaspoon of the butter. Turn the lobster meaty side down again and grill until golden brown about 2 minutes. Turn the lobster tails shell side down and splash with SoCo. Add more butter but not all to the lobster tails poking it in the shell under the meat and on top and let cook until the lobster releases juice and starts simmering about 3 minutes. The lobster tails will continue to lose translucency until a thin band remains down the center of the tails this should take about 3 minutes longer. Just before removing from the grill spread the tails with the remaining butter. Serve right away.,

instructions, 1. Equipment: 1 quart flanera or 1 quart round casserole dish with lid AND 1 ovenproof dish or baking pan that the flanera or casserole will fit into.
2. Caramel: Some people like to make caramel by adding water to sugar and then cooking it to a nice dark golden brown and some just like to melt the sugar to golden without water. Either method will work here. If you are using a flanera which is a metal pan with a lock-down lid you can make the caramel right in the flanera. If you are using a casserole dish make the caramel in a saucepan and pour into the bottom of the casserole dish.
3. Custard: As you prepare the custard the caramel will cool. In a separate bowl beat the 1 whole egg and 5 egg yolks together. A whisk works very well here. Add the evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk to the eggs and mix together. Add the vanilla extract either 1/2 teaspoon or 1 teaspoon depending on what strength you prefer. Pour the custard mixture into the flanera or casserole dish over the hardened caramel. Put on the lid.
4. Put your flan into the ovenproof dish or baking pan and fill with hot water to about half-way up the sides or as high as you can go and still move the thing without spilling hot water on yourself.
5. Bake in a pre-heated 350 degree oven for 45 minutes. Turn off the oven and let set for another 15 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven and the water-bath and let cool.
7. Plating: Run a butter-knife around the outside edge of the flan. Place a plate large enough to handle the liquid caramel over the flan and invert. Chill the flan for at least an hour before serving.
8. Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Cut the vegetables in chunks. If you like you can skin the tomatoes but it isn't necessary.
2. Process all the vegetables in a blender in small batches with tomato juice and olive oil until you have a thick puree. Add tomato juice and oil with every batch to provide plenty of liquid.
3. For the last batch soak bread in warm water squeeze out excess water add the bread and blend well.
4. Pour it all into a bowl or like I do a pitcher and add the vinegar and lime juice.
5. Season with salt pepper and cumin.
6. Mix well.

instructions, 1. ROASTING THE PORK: Mix all of the marinade ingredients together (all of the ingredients except the pork) and rub this mixture over all surfaces of the pork. Cover well and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours.
2. Place the pork in a roasting pan or ovenproof dish and roast it in a preheated 425°F oven for 30 to 40 minutes basting occasionally with the pan juices until cooked through. Remove the pork from the oven and cool it completely before slicing thinly.
3. ASSEMBLING THE SANDWICH: Slice the Cuban loaves in half horizontally. Brush the cut surfaces of the rolls with olive oil or melted butter. Layer the sandwiches as follows: Swiss cheese sliced pickle ham sliced roast pork then additional cheese.
4. Now comes the somewhat challenging part. You want to grill these sandwiches top and bottom while at the same time flattening them slightly. This helps meld all of the filling ingredients. Heat two large skillets or a griddle to medium about 325°F Lightly grease the griddle and/or skillets. Brush the bottoms of the sandwiches lightly with olive oil or melted butter. Place them in the greased pan(s). Brush the tops with oil or butter. Top them with a piece of parchment paper or foil then a flat sheet pan or other flat non-meltable object—the point is to provide a flat surface for a weight. Place something heavy atop the pan—a teakettle filled with water makes a good weight as does a clean brick wrapped in aluminum foil.
5. Grill the sandwiches for 5 to 7 minutes over medium heat checking often to make sure the bottoms aren't burning. Adjust the heat downward if the bottoms are becoming brown after only a couple of minutes. Turn the sandwiches over and grill for several more minutes until they're slightly crisp on both sides and the cheese is melting. Remove from the heat cut the sandwiches in 2 and serve warm.,

instructions, 1. STARTER: The day before baking dissolve the yeast in warm water in a nonreactive bowl. Add flour. You want a thick paste when you add the flour. Cover bowl with plastic wrap (punch a couple air holes) and place in refrigerator for 24 hours.
2. Leftover starter can be left in the refrigerator or frozen. (You will need to maintain starter if you are going to keep it; there are several zaar recipies that describe sourdough starter care.).
3. DOUGH: Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a large mixing bowl. When the mixture is foamy (5 to 10 minutes) mix in the lard/ shortening remaining water and starter (remember it's 1/2 cup of starter and not the entire volume that you made the day before).
4. Mix well with your fingers or a wooden spoon. Stir in salt and flour 1 cup at a time. You want to get a dough that is stiff enough to knead. You can also mix and knead in a mixer fitted with a dough hook or in a food processor fitted with the double blade (the processor hook will not handle this job easily).
5. Turn dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic about 6 to 8 minutes adding flour as necessary. The dough should be pliable and not sticky.
6. Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl cover and let warm draft-free spot until it doubles its bulk about 45 minutes. Punch down.
7. To form the loaves divide the dough in 4 pieces. Roll out each piece to form a 14-inch long tube with rounded ends (sort of like a long meat loaf).
8. Put 2 of the loaves per baking sheet each loaf about 6 inches apart on the sheet. Cover with dampened cotton dish towel and let rise in warm draft-free spot until double their bulk about 1 hour. If you want it to rise at a slower pace you can put it in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours.
9. Preheat oven to 350°F.
10. Lay a piece of dampened thick string or twine (about 1/8" thick) all along the top of the loaf. Bake until the loaves are lightly browned on the top and sound hollow when lightly tapped about 30 minutes.
11. Remove loaves from oven and let cool slightly. Remove the strings. They will leave a distinct little ridge on top. Transfer loaves to a wire rack for cooling.,

instructions, 1. Prepare a caramel by adding the 1/4 cup of water to 3/4 cups of sugar in a small saucepan over medium to low heat. Stir while cooking until the sugar starts melting. Let it simmer. Use a pastry brush dipped in water to wash the sides of the pan free of granular sugar. When sugar starts to thicken and turn brown remove from heat and add 2 cubes of ice to stop the cooking process being very careful not to get burned with any splattering that may occur. Coat a warm baking dish or round mold by pouring the caramel and swirl it around the sides and bottom. put the coated mold aside( By the way the mold should be 9 inches in diameter).
2. Now comes the good part.
3. In a saucepan bring to a boil the milk with the lemon peel cinnamon stick and salt. When the mixtures starts to boil remove from heat and let it cool a little bit. (like my mother use to say: dejala refrescar).
4. In a medium bowl beat lightly the egg yolks whites vanilla and sugar until well mixed.
5. Pour into the bowl the slightly cooled milk and strain the egg and milk mixture into the caramel coated mold.
6. OK so far?.
7. Place the flan mold inside a baking dish filled with water up to half of the mold side (bain Mary or baño Maria).
8. Now you have three choices of cooking it.
9. 1) Cook over stove top at low to medium flame till a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out dry.
10. 2) Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for about an hour in the middle rack. Insert a knife or toothpick in the center if it comes out dry remove from the oven and let it cool till warm.
11. 3) In a pressure cooker cook in a cup of water at 15 pounds of pressure for about 25 minutes.
12. When cooled place serving dish flat against top of mold and turn it upside down in a fast motion.,

instructions, 1. Place the rice barley and cinnamon sticks in a large saucepan and cover with 4 cups water. Bring to a boil and then lower the heat to a simmer and cover.
2. Simmer covered for 20 minutes. Add more water if needed to prevent sticking to the bottom. Once the rice and barley are cooked turn off the heat and stir though the sugar vanilla nutmeg and another 3 cups cold water.
3. Remove the cinnamon sticks and blend in batches.
4. Pass the blended liquid through a strainer into a large bowl using a spoon to press down and squeeze as much liquid out as possible. You'll end up with a bowl of thick liquid and the mushy solids that you couldn't strain any more liquid out of (put these aside in a container and eat them for breakfast as porridge so delicious!).
5. Stir the remaining water and the rice milk through the liquid that you strained out of the barley and rice. If you like you can thin it out a bit more with some more water it's up to you.

5. When the calamari is tender but slightly resilient to the bite remove the colander season the pieces with another 1/4 teaspoon salt mix well then let them drain and cool for 5 minutes.

instructions, 1. Make the sauce:
2. Puree ingredients in a food processor and simmer in a saucepan over low heat for about 20 minutes adding water if necessary to make it your desired consistency.
3. If using dried tomatoes soak them in hot water to soften them before pureeing the sauce. You may also mix the sauce by hand if you finely chop the softened or oil-packed tomatoes.
4. Make the crust:
5. Dissolve yeast and brown sugar in warm (not hot) water.
6. Let sit for 10 minutes. It should start to bubble.
7. Stir the salt and oil into the yeast mixture.
8. Mix in 2 1/2 cups of the flour along with the vital wheat gluten (Not necessary but it makes the crust more chewy. You can find it in the baking aisle of most markets near the flour in a small cornstarch-sized box).
9. Turn dough out onto a clean dry surface dusted with flour and knead for about 5 minutes more adding a little flour as necessary (1/4-1/2 cup) to make the dough come together in a firm smooth ball. If you accidentally make the dough too dry try adding small amounts of extra-virgin olive oil or drops of warm water to the dough to reachive a glossy consistency. You may use a food processor or stand mixer to mix and knead your dough if you prefer.
10. Place the dough into a well oiled bowl and cover with a clean cloth. If you can refrigerate your dough overnight at this point it will be preferred (cover with plastic instead of cloth to keep the dough moist). If you do so allow time the next day for the dough to warm and double in size with a cloth covering as mentioned in the next step.
11. Let the dough double in size. This could take up to an hour depending on the temperature in your proofing area.
12. Make the pizza:
13. Punch down divide the dough and let the dough rest for 15 minutes. You can start preheating your oven at this point to about 425°F or 220°C If using a baking stone it needs to be preheated as well. Place your stone or pan as high in the oven as possible because very hot air is preferred to bake the pizza and hot air will rise to the top of the oven.
14. Roll out on a lightly floured or cornmeal dusted surface or parchment paper (I roll mine out on parchment paper) and top the dough with sauce (any extra sauce can be refrigerated or frozen) and whatever toppings you like being careful not to add too many. If the dough contracts too much when rolling out walk away from it for 15 minutes to allow the dough to relax. Then come back and roll it out (or hand toss it if you feel confident or feel like having fun).
15. Transfer your dough to a pizza peel or oiled pizza pan (I use a peel with the dough on parchment and slide the paper right onto a heated baking stone).
16. You can par-bake your dough for 5 minutes or so to get the dough more crunchy but be careful with thin doughs as they might try to bubble and burn.
17. Bake your pizza for 10-20 minutes until it is bubbly and the cheese is lightly browned (your time increases with increased toppings).
18. Remove from oven cut into serving slices and enjoy. (Bye-Bye Miss American Pie!).,

instructions, 1. Rough chop onion and garlic.
2. Heat up a large pan on medium heat.
3. Pour in all of olive oil.
4. Dump in onion and sauté until soft.
5. Add garlic bay leaf oregano salt and pepper.
6. Stir all together into a mess and continue to cook if it seems to hot turn down the heat you don't want to burn anything.
7. Once everything is well mixed and cooked turn up the heat for about 1 minute.  I tell you to do this as you are about to add the balsamic vinegar to "deglaze" and you will want the pan hot.
8. Add balsamic stir quickly while hot steam rises. the vapors should make you eyes water and nose run so be careful to remain hygienic.  when vapors stop remove from heat.
9. Open all the cans of crushed tomato.
10. Stir in one can at a time with wooden spoon or rubber spatula.
11. Once all cans are in stir well again so you don't see any oil on the top of sauce. return to heat.  Cook on low heat uncovered stirring whenever you walk into the kitchen for some other reason.  You don't need to stir it every hour but do it whenever you get around to it. although you do need to stir it from time to time.
12. Cook for at least five hours.  If you want to do this while you go to work you can transfer everything to a crock pot but you must start in a big metal pot. Your choice.
13. Serve over your favorite pasta or use to cook my meatball recipe which is highly recommended ( look at the reviews). doing my meatballs is particularly easy if you have transferred gravy to a crock pot but if you do you may need to remove some sauce to fit the balls in the sauce.
14. Freeze left over sauce just pour cooled sauce in zip-lock bags and throw in freezer.,

instructions, 1. Make the Mashed Potatoes:
2. Peel the potatoes and cut into a large dice.  Place in pot and cover with cold water.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and then reduce heat to a simmer cooking the potatoes until a fork inserted in a potato dice causes it to break apart.  Drain the potatoes and then return to the pot adding the cream and butter.  Mash the potatoes until smooth then season with the salt and pepper.  Add the egg yolk stirring until well combined.  Set the mashed potatoes aside.
3. Make the Meat Filling.
4. (If you are a confident kitchen multi-tasker you can prepare the meat filling while the potatoes are cooking to decrease the total prep time on the meal).
5. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
6. Heat a large saute pan or dutch oven (for a one-pot meal) over medium-high heat.  Add the oil allow it to heat for a moment then add the onion and carrots.  Saute the veggies about four minutes or until the onions just begin to brown.  Stir in the crushed garlic then crumble in the ground beef and stir to brown.  Cook the meat 3-5 minutes or until the beef is cooked through.  Season with the salt and pepper then sprinkle on the flour tossing to coat the meat.  Cook the floured meat for another minute.   Stir in the tomato paste chicken broth Worcestershire sauce and thyme.  Allow the mix to come to a boil stirring to keep the mixture from sticking to the bottom of the pot.  Reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly.
7. If you prepared the meat in a dutch oven or similar casserole you may leave the meat mixture in that dish and continue with the recipe.  Otherwise to bake the dish in a casserole pan spread the meat mixture evenly into an 11" by 7" glass baking dish. The glass baking dish is prone to boil-overs so set it on a foil- or parchment-lined cookie sheet when baking.
8. Spread the peas and corn on top of the meat mixture then gently top with the mashed potatoes starting at the edges and smoothing the potatoes towards the middle of the dish with an offset metal or rubber spatula.
9. Place the casserole on a rack in the middle of the oven and backe for 25 minutes or until the potatoes begin to brown.  Remove to a cooling rack for 15 minutes before serving.,

2. Combine the flour sugar and salt.
3. Place all liquid ingredients in blender and pulse to mix. With the motor running pour in the flour mixture. Scrape down the sides and blend again to thoroughly mix about 20 seconds. The batter should be about the consistency of heavy cream. Stir in the zest. Cover and chill for at least one hour before using (or up to 24 hours).
4. Pour a small amount of vegetable oil into the crepe pan and wipe out with a paper towel. You will not have to grease the pan again.
5. Place the pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the chilled batter. Lifting the pan off the burner swirl the batter around the pan to form an even very thin coating. The first side will be golden in about 1 minute. Loosen lightly with the edge of a spatula and flip to cook the second side for about a minute.
6. Transfer each completed crepe to a rack to cool and proceed with the next. If you are making the crepes for future use when cool - layer them with waxed paper and freeze or refrigerate.
7. To Fill: Spread 1 rounded tablespoon of filling across the middle of the crepe and fold in half and then into quarters. Put in a buttered baking dish overlapping the fans as you go. Crepes can be prepared to this stage well wrapped and refrigerated up to 24 hours in advance.
8. To bake: Pre heat oven to 400°. Drizzle folded crepes with 3 tablespoons melted margarine (sprinkle of ginger or cinnamon or sugar depending on filling). Bake in pre-heated oven for 10 to 12 minutes until bubbling.,

instructions, 1. Combine the flour pancake mix and baking soda in a deep bowl. Stirring constantly with a whisk or spoon pour in the club soda and water in a slow stream and continue to stir until the mixture is a smooth thin cream.
2. Strain the batter through a fine sieve set over a clean bowl pressing down hard on any lumps with the back of a large spoon. Cook the injera in a 10 inch skillet or omelette pan with a non-stick cooking surface or a well-seasoned 10 inch cast iron skillet.
3. Warm the ungreased pan over moderate heat until it is just hot enough to set the batter without browning it. To test the heat pour 1 tablespoon of the batter into the centre of the pan. The bottom surface should solidify immediately without becoming brown.
4. For each injera remove the pan from the heat and ladle in 1/4 cup of the batter. Then quickly tip the pan back and forth to cover the bottom evenly. Cover the pan partially and cook the bread over moderate heat for 1 minute or just until the top is spongy moist and dotted with tiny air holes. The bottom should be smooth dry and somewhat shiny.
5. Do not let the bottom brown; otherwise the edges may become too crisp. Remove the pan from the heat and use a spatula or your fingers to lift the injera gently out of the pan. Lay it on a plate to cool and ladle another 1/4 cup of batter into the pan tipping and spreading the batter evenly.
6. Repeat the cooking process and when the next injera is done transfer the cooled bread to a platter and place the hot injera on the plate. Continue making the breads in the same fashion with the remaining batter.
7. To serve spread 7 or 8 injera out in a shallow or flat basket or on a large platter letting them overlap each other and rape over the edge of the container. Fold the rest of the injera into quarters and arrange them attractively in the centre. To eat them tear off a small piece and use it to scoop up food.

name, American Buttercream Frosting, 
cuisine, Latin American >> Central American >> Honduran, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Optional- As mentioned above I like a cream cheese version of this frosting best.  The cream cheese adds to the creamy texture and cuts down on the sweetness just a bit.  If desired for a very light cream cheese flavor add 1/2 block (4 oz). cream cheese leaving the other ingredients (as listed above) the same.  For a more traditional cream cheese flavor reduce the butter to 1/2 cup and add 1 block (8 oz.) of cream cheese.  If using a full block of cream cheese you can reduce the cream or milk to 1 tablespoon total.
2. Flavoring options- An almost unlimited number of flavoring options can be added in addition to or instead of the vanilla.  Orange and/or lemon zest citrus extracts mint extract coconut extract or the seeds of a vanilla bean are all wonderful options.  In most cases I’ll still add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla then 1/2 teaspoon of the other flavoring.  For zest add about 1 teaspoon fresh zest.  For chocolate buttercream add 1/2 cup (good quality) unsweetened cocoa powder.
3. Directions-.
4. * In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment beat butter (on medium speed) until completely smooth (30 seconds to a minute). (If you are adding cream cheese add it now then beat until smooth).
5. * Add salt (if needed).
6. * One cup at time add 2 cups of powdered sugar beating after each addition.
7. * Add vanilla or other flavorings and beat to combine.
8. * Add about 1 tablespoon of cream and continue beating.
9. * Add the remaining 2 cups powdered sugar one at a time.
10. * Add an additional 1-2 tablespoons cream until desired consistency is reached.  If you want to pipe the frosting on cupcakes the frosting should be nice and thick.  Continue to beat another minute or so.  The frosting should now be smooth and fluffy.
11. Troubleshooting-.
12. * If your frosting is not smooth it is likely because the butter was not fully smooth before adding the other ingredients.
13. * If your frosting will not hold up when piped on cupcakes your frosting has too much liquid or is too warm.  Put entire bowl of frosting in the fridge for 15-20 minutes and it will stiffen up.  If it is still too thin then add 1/4 to 1/2 cup powdered sugar beat well.,

instructions, 1. Place the potatoes in a large saucepan cover with salted water and bring to a boil uncovered over medium-high heat. Cook the potatoes until a knife pierces them easily. Drain the potatoes and set them aside to steam dry for 3 to 4 minutes.
2. Mash the potatoes until smooth or put them through a ricer. Season to taste with salt. When cool enough form 1/3 cup portions of the mashed potatoes into balls and set on a baking sheet. Chill for at least 20 minutes; this will make the patties much easier to handle.
3. While the potatoes are chilling start your maní sauce. Simmer the milk and sliced onion in a small saucepan for about 10 minutes. Do not boil. Strain the onions from the milk and discard. Whisk the peanut butter into the warm milk and season to taste with salt. Bring to a boil reduce heat to low and simmer until thickened 4 to 5 minutes. The sauce should be the consistency of heavy cream. Add a little more milk or peanut butter as needed. Set aside.
4. Remove potatoes from the refrigerator. Mix the cheese and scallions together and stuff each ball with about 1 tablespoon of the mixture. Flatten the balls with your hands to form patties.
5. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté the patties a few at a time until browned on each side. Remove to a warm oven until all patties have been sautéed. Serve topped with the salsa de maní.
6. Llapingachos Variations:
7. •Coloring: The achiote powder gives the patties an orange color. If you don't have achiote add a teaspoon or two of paprika. Or just leave it out altogether.
8. •Cheese: Ecuadorans typically use a young white cheese called queso blanco for stuffing llapingachos but you can use Monterey jack or mozzarella.
9. •Use finely minced white onion instead of scallions.
10. •Mix the cheese and scallions in with the potatoes instead of stuffing them.
11. •Add a little cayenne pepper or hot pepper sauce to the to the peanut sauce if you'd like some heat. Or add a little ground cumin for extra flavor.,

instructions, 1. In a heavy saucepan mix chocolate with condensed milk and add the margarine. Cook in low heat stirring constantly until you can see the bottom of the pan. Continue to stir for another two minutes. Pour onto a plate and let cool completely before you form the little balls (I usually leave it in the cupboard until next day). Butter your hands slightly to form the little balls. Roll the balls in chocolate powder or jimmies and put them in small paper cups.
2. A little cultural note: Have you noticed how many Brazilian recipes are made with condensed milk? It came to Brazil from Switzerland over a hundred years ago. It's made by Nestlé and because the label featured the picture of a milkmaid the cans became known as the "maid milk' and that's what condensed milk is called to this day (Leite Moça).,

instructions, 1. In a 3-qt heavy-duty saucepan combine the condensed milk cream 6 tbs ground pistachios corn syrup and butter and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to cook stirring constantly with a whisk until the mixture thickens and starts to form a dense batter. This will take about 12 minutes. When the mixture is properly cooked the whisk will leave trails in the batter that briefly expose the bottom of the pan and the mixture will slide to the side in a blob when the pan is tilted leaving a thick residue on the bottom of the pan.
2. Slide the mixture into a bowl but do not scrape the pan -- you don't want to use the residue that's stuck to the pan or your candies will be gritty and off-textured. Allow the mixture to cool to room temp then chill for about 3 to 4 hours or until mixture is very firm.
3. Put the remaining ground pistachios (you should have 1/4 cup left) in a bowl. Using a small cookie scoop portion out the mixture and roll by hand into balls that are approximately 1" in diameter. Drop each rolled ball into the pistachios and toss to coat. Remove the coated candies from the pistachios allowing the excess nuts to sift through your fingers and place the candies in tiny paper candy cups. If you find that the nuts are not sticking well to the outside of the candies you can roll them around a bit more in your hands before coating (this warms them up a bit so they soften).
4. These can be stored tightly covered at room temperature If you choose to refrigerate them for storage allow them to come to room temp before serving for best flavor.,

instructions, 1. In a pan add the condensed milk 100g of coconut flakes and the butter. Now the fun begins! Over medium heat start stirring. And keep stirring until the mixture thickens and you can see the bottom of the pan for a good few seconds before the mixture levels out again. This is really important. This process should take at least 6-7 min don’t rush it or it won’t be the right consistency to roll into balls.
2. Leave it to cool about 15min or enough so that it is cool to handle and it has hardened up a little.
3. Grab the flakes you had reserved for rolling. You can do 2 things here: 1) Use them as they are to roll or 2) Blitz them so that they are super fine. I blitzed them as I like the outside texture to be soft. But it is totally up to you if you decide to do this.
4. Coat your hands in a little butter (just so that the mixture doesn’t stick) and start making your balls. I like mine the size of a little smaller than a measuring tablespoon. Once all rolled out put one clove in the midle for decoration. This is traditional and for decoration. Remove it before eating and it does leave a nice taste.,

It's an extra step but worth it because bad beans are nasty if left inches Put beans in a bowl and cover with water. Next day dump water and you are ready to go.
2. Cut up bacon and fry to a crisp. Chop up into small pieces. Use some of the bacon grease and sauté onions and garlic. Put beans fresh water onion/garlic and bacon into a crock pot. Add salt until the water tastes pretty salty like you would want it to taste when done cooking. Add bay leaves and cook on high for 6 hours.
3. Something else that makes it really good (and really Brazilian) is to eat it with a salad made with just lettuce tomato and dressed with lime juice olive oil and salt (I actually put the salt right on the lettuce then add the dressing and toss).

7. Place the biscuits on baking sheet so that they barely touch. Gather up the scrap dough press it into a circle working it as little as possible and continue cutting until all dough has been used.
8. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown.

23. Roll out the remaining dough and cut out tops for the empadinhas.
24. Try to capture an air bubble when you place the top over the filling: this is what makes the pie light.
25. Seal the tartlets by pinching together the top and bottom crust.
26. Note: the empadinhas can be prepared ahead to this stage and frozen.
27. Preheat the oven to 375° F.
28. Brush the tops of the empadinhas with egg glaze.
29. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown.
30. Unmold and serve.
31. If you're lazy like me try this big pie version called empadão: make the filling and use Pillsbury pie crusts one for the bottom and one for the top.

instructions, 1. Sweet Balsamic Reduction:
2. Put the balsamic vinegar and sugar into a small saucepan. Heat over medium-low heat and stir until the sugar dissolves. Bring to a simmer and simmer until the vinegar is reduced to 3 or 4 tablespoons. It should be the consistency of warmed honey and will have a caramelized sweet-tart flavor. This takes approximately 10 minutes. (You can refrigerate and store this reduction for up to 2 weeks.).
3. Leeks:
4. Trim the leeks and cut them in half lengthwise. Under running water use your fingers to gently pull open the layers of the leeks to rinse away the sand. Shake the excess water off. Thinly slice the leeks lengthwise into long thin strips.
5. Heat the oil and butter in a large skiller over low heat. When the butter has melted add the leeks. If you can't add all the leeks at one time add them in batches and use tongs to turn them gently as they cook bringing the leeks on the bottom of the pan to the top as they reduce in volume -- this will make more room.
6. Once all of the leeks have been added cook gently stirring occasionally until they are soft enough to be twirled on a fork like spaghetti! This should take approximately 18 to 10 minutes. Add a little more butter or oil if needed.
7. Serve drizzling a little of the reduced balsamic vinegar over each portion.,

9. While the black beans are simmering remove and discard the collard greens stems and rinse the leaves well. Stack leaves and slice. In a saucepan bring the greens and water to a boil. Cover and simmer (stir frequently) for about 15 minutes until greens are tender.
10. Peel and section the oranges and set aside. When the black beans and the rice are both ready drain the greens and toss with soy sauce. Serve the feijoada on a large platter with the black beans on a bed of rice with the greens piled to one side and the oranges arranged around the edges.,

Simmer until potatoes are very tender (about 25 minutes). Remove pot from heat and let the meat and potatoes cool in the broth.
3. Remove the meat from the broth and slice into 1” cubes then put cut up steak into a food processor and pulse it until it looks like ground beef *DO NOT OVER PROCESS YOU DO NOT WANT TO MAKE BABY FOOD OUT OF THE STEAK*.
4. Remove potatoes from the broth and set aside in a separate bowl strain the broth and reserve it.
5. Add the potatoes the meat and vegetables into the same bowl. Add a little of the beef broth to the mixture and mix well mashing the potatoes in the process.
6. Prepare the dough:.Place 3 cups yellow masarepa (pre-cooked cornmeal) into a large bowl add 2 teaspoons of sugar and salt and pepper to taste incorporate the dry ingredients well before adding the liquid.
7. Combine 1 cup of reserved broth 2 ¼ cups of hot water and 1 tablespoon of softened butter.
8. Slowly add the cornmeal to the water and stir with a big spoon. When all of the corn meal has been added work the dough with your hands until it becomes soft. Let rest for 20 minutes.
9. Making the empanadas:.To make the empanadas put a small ball of dough (about the size of a golf ball) in the center of a tortilla press covered with plastic and press to flatten it. You can also put the small ball of dough between two pieces of plastic and flatten it with a small saucepan.
10. Add a tablespoon or so of the filling. Fold the circle of dough in half to form a half moon.
11. Cut off the edge of the half moon with a cup or drinking glass. This will shape your empanada and seal it at the same time. Another way to make them is pressing the edge with your fingers and folding the extra dough inwards this will prevent the filling from coming out during frying.
12. you can fry them in a deep frier at 350ºF. You can also fry them on the stove at medium high temperature. Fry the empanadas for 5-7 minutes or until golden brown. Then put them on a paper towels to drain them.
13. *Note: You can shape the empanadas a day ahead and chill them until you are ready to fry. Once empanadas are cooked keep them warm in a 200 degree oven until ready to serve.,

7. Now if you have a tortilla press you’re sitting pretty for the next step.  If you don’t have one two pieces of 1” wood about 8” square will do just fine.  Lacking that anything flat and a counter top will work.  Or if you feel adventurous you can use your own two little hands!
8. Roll the “masa” (dough) into little balls about 1” in diameter.  Place the masa ball on top of a piece of plastic wrap or wax paper.  Cover with another piece of plastic or wax paper and press it into a flat circle (depending on the size of the original masa ball the flat circle will turn out to be about 3 to 4 inches in diameter).  Remove the top piece of plastic.  Now add about one rounded tablespoon of the filling to the middle of the circle leaving about 1/2” of space on the sides.  Using the plastic fold the circle in half and press the edges together so it forms a half-moon.  Remove from the plastic and using your fingers press the edges firmly together so the empanada is sealed.  I like to make them pretty so after the empanada is sealed I take the tip of my finger and fold the edges at small intervals so that the empanada has a “scalloped” look to the edges.
9. Cook them in bunches but don’t prepare too many at a time and let them sit while the others cook since this tends to dry out the masa too much.  Also as you are cooking keep the bowl of masa covered with a humid towel to keep it from getting too dry.
10. Cooking.
11. The traditional method of course is to fry the empanadas in a large iron cauldron (approximately 50 years old) on top of a wood fire outdoors in about twenty pounds of pork lard that was used to fry the empanadas for the last month and a half.
12. However tradition does not always mean that it is right.  Most of the time tradition simply means “lack of technology and alternate methods.”.
13. I use a deep-fat fryer filled with Canola or Peanut oil.  For even healthier empanadas they can be baked in the oven at 350 degrees F on a greased cookie sheet.  Baking them of course takes longer and you will have to turn the empanadas once.  Bake or fry until golden brown.
14. If you fry them (the best method because they turn out nice and crunchy) make sure you place the finished empanadas on a cookie sheet whose bottom you have lined with a thick layer of paper towels.  This will allow the excess oil to drain.
15. The tradition in Colombia is to have an empanada in one hand and a wedge of lemon in the other.  As you take a bite you squeeze a few drops of lemon juice inside.  A bowl of your favorite salsa and a teaspoon will also do the job quite well.  This recipe should yield approximately 4 to 5 dozen empanadas.
16. Waste not want not.
17. I made a bunch of empanadas the other day and found that I had mad way too much masa for the amount of filling I had.  I did not want to waste the masa nor did I want to put it in the refrigerator until the next time I made empanadas.  So I thought about it for a while.  I had about two pounds of masa left so I added a large package of shredded Monterey Jack cheese a whole lot more cumin some more onion powder and garlic powder and a little more salt.  I then browned one pound of ground sausage and added it to the mixture.
18. I rolled the mixture into 1” balls and deep fried them.  They were great!  I love it when my weird experiments turn into new recipes!,

instructions, 1. Dough:  Combine the 5 cups of flour and baking powder in a large bowl.  Cut in the margarine until the mixture has a crumbly consistency.  In a small pot boil the soy milk with 1 tablespoons salt.  Pour the boiling liquid into the flour mixture and mix without kneading.  Cover with a tea towel and let the dough rest for approximately 1/2 hour.  It is very important to let the dough rest at this stage or you will not be able to roll it out.
2. Filling:  Heat the oil in a pot or a saucepan that has a tight-fitting lid.  Add the ground meat diced onion and spices.  Stir.  If using raisins they should be mixed in at this stage so that the flavours blend into each other during cooking. Cover reduce heat and let cook for approximately 15 minute or until the meat is cooked through and the onions are transparent.  The mixture will release liquid during cooking. If the mixture looks dry (the liquid may have evaporated if the heat was too high or due to an ill-fitting lid) you can add a couple fo tablespoons of water.  Take off the stove and stir in 1 tablespoons of flour.  Let cool.
3. Assembly:  Roll out dough using extra flour to avoid sticking.  Cut out large circles.  Fill each circle with  approximately 1 heaping tablespoon of meat 1 slice of hardboiled egg and 1 black olive.  Dab the perimeter of the dough with a tiny bit of water to help seal the edges.
4. Folding:  There are 2 ways to fold the empanada (if making 2 types of filling you can use the 2 different syle of folding the empanada to distinguish between them).  Method A:  Fold the circle in half to form a semi-circle.  Pinch the edges all the way around the circle.  Method B: Fold the circle in half to make a semi-circle.  Fold over the rounded edge of the semi-circle to make a rectangle. Now fold over both sides edges of the dough to make an "envelope" shape. Press the corners.  This option only seems more complicated than the first.  It is best because it results in a more secure seal although some juices inevitably escape during baking!
5. Baking:  Preheat oven to 350. Arrange empanadas on a greased cookie sheet. Brush with egg wash.  Bake for about 30-35 minute or until they are golden.  Let them rest for 5 minute before biting into them!,

instructions, 1. Place the potatoes in a large pot of cold salted water. Bring to a boil and cook the potatoes until they are tender and cooked through. Drain and set aside to cool.
2. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle peel them. Put the potatoes through a ricer or mash with a potato masher until smooth. Stir in the oil pepper paste if using lime or lemon juice salt and pepper to taste.
3. Line a casserole dish or baking pan with plastic wrap pressing it down to fit the dish. Spread half the potatoes into the bottom of the dish and smooth out. Spread the desired filling evenly over the potatoes. Spread the remaining potatoes evenly over the filling. Press down gently to firm up your causa. Cover and chill thoroughly.
4. Lay a serving platter upside-down over the top of the causa dish. Using both hands flip the dish and platter over letting the causa fall onto the platter. Remove and discard the plastic wrap.
5. Garnish the causa decoratively with the hard-boiled eggs and olives and if you like a sauce. Cut into portions and serve.
6. Causa Rellena Variations.
7. •Potatoes: Peru has hundreds of varieties of potatoes. Bright yellow types are usually used for causa rellena their color boosted by the ají peppers. Yukon gold are a good substitute in the United States. If you can find blue potatoes give those a try too. Instead of lime or lemon juice some cooks use bitter orange juice.
8. •Fillings: Chicken or seafood salads bound together with mayonnaise are very common causa fillings. For seafood try tuna salad crab salad shrimp salad poached or fried fish or seafood smoked trout or seafood ceviche.
9. Vegetarian fillings include sliced avocados sliced or grated cheese sliced or chopped tomatoes corn kernels thinly sliced red onions.
10. •Garnishes: Hard-boiled eggs and pitted black olives are the classic Peruvian garnish. You can also use shredded or whole lettuce leaves or any of the filling ingredients to garnish.
11. •Sauces: Sauces are often drizzled over a finished causa. Try mixing mayonnaise a little lemon juice ketchup or avocado puree and drizzle it decoratively over and around the causa with a squeeze bottle. Or make Salsa Huancaina: 12 ounces feta or ricotta cheese;  5 fresh chopped ají amarillo peppers; 1/2 cup milk; 2 cloves garlic; 1/2 cup oil; salt and pepper. Put the cheese peppers milk and garlic into a blender and puree. With the blender still running drizzle in the oil until the sauce has a creamy consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
12. •A popular alternative way to form the causa is rolled up like a jellyroll or pionono. Spread the potatoes into a smooth rectangle over a layer of plastic wrap. Spread the filling over the potatoes. Lift the plastic wrap from one end of the potatoes and roll the potatoes up over the filling. Place seam-side down on a serving platter garnish and serve in slices. Causa rellena can also be formed in a springform pan or as individual portions.
13. •Causa Limeña: A causa from Lima served with a fish filling or with fried fish on the side.,

instructions, 1. Place the pieces of heart in a glass or ceramic tray.
2. Previously soak the chiles in hot water until they are soft devein and take the seeds off. If you want you can keep some of the seeds to make it spicier.   In Peru we use aji panca but this works well too.
3. Blend the vinegar garlic aji panca (or dried chile) and all other ingredients  with 1/2 cup of the oil until you have a soft paste.
4. Pour it on the pieces of heart and distribute evenly so all pieces are well covered and can absorb the marinade.  Cover and let sit in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Do not let them marinade for too long or they will dry out because of the vinegar.
5. In the meantime place thick bamboo skewers to soak in water so they don't burn when they go on the grill.
6. Use a charcoal grill and make sure the coals are very hot before you start.
7. Stick three or four pieces of heart in each skewer so that the meat lays flat.
8. Save the rest of the marinade in a cup or small bowl and add the rest of the oil to it mixing well. This will be used for basting the anticuchos on the grill.
9. Tie some pieces of fresh corn husk with a string made out of some more husk and shred them half the way to make a kind of brush and use it for basting. (You can use dry husk too but you need to soak it for a while in warm water  to make it flexible and then pat it dry before you use it).
10. When the coals are ready and the grill is hot  place the anticuchos flat on the grill and baste them generously with the leftover marinade and oil mix.
11. This will drip and cause the coals to flame make sure it flames over because this is what gives the anticuchos their distinctive flavor.
12. Let anticuchos cook for about 1 minute and a half on each side. DO NOT OVERCOOK!  They will dry out and become tough. Medium or medium well is fine. Turn them over continuously and keep basting and flaming until they are done.
13. Hold two or three at a time to turn them over  quickly.
14. At the same time place the pieces of corn and potatoes on a corner of the grill baste them with the same marinade and allow them to be flamed too.
15. Serve three skewers in each plate accompanied by one piece of corn and one potato.  You can also cut the potatoes in half (across not length wise) and stick a piece at the end of each skewer.
16. Serve hot right out of the grill don't let it get cold!  ENJOY! :P.
17. What takes the longest time is to slice and cut the heart in squares and  stick the pieces on the skewers; as you get practice doing this it will be faster allow yourself some more time of preparation the first couple of times.
18. You can also use regular beef chicken fish prawns or lamb to make anticuchos but the original and traditional recipe calls for cow heart. Hope you like it! :).,

instructions, 1. You will need a small pot with a lid. A capacity of 1 to 3 quarts is good.
2. Bring the water to a strong boil at highest temperature.
3. Add the rice to the boiling water. Swirl the rice once with a spoon so that it covers the bottom of the pot uniformly.
4. Watch the rice boil until you see the bubbles form a pock-marked pattern with its vigorous boiling. This takes 1 to 2 minutes.
5. Lower the heat to simmer. About 2.5 out of 10 on the dial is about right on my stove. Your stove may need to be set slightly higher or lower. You want the heat to be high enough so that steam is always being formed in the pot but not so hot that the rice scorches on the bottom of the pot.
6. When the boiling dies down a bit cover the pot and set the timer to 20 minutes.
7. Remove the lid of the pot and your rice is done. For your first batch test the rice with a fork and give it a taste test. It should be fluffy and tender.
8. (The texture of fried rice benefits from a firmer rice kernel. Use 1 1/2 cups of water instead of 1 2/3 cups of water to achieve this texture. When it is done leave the lid off the pot and allow the rice to cool. Then use the cooled rice in your fried rice recipe. The cooling is optional.).,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Over med. heat melt sugar in a cake pan or in a pot. You can add a tiny bit of water (1 Tablespoon or so) before sugar heats up to make it a little lighter.
2. After sugar is melted it should be light brown. Don't let it get dark or burn. Take off the heat and if it's in the cake pan let it cool. If it's in a saucepan pour it into the cake pan and let cover the bottom of the pan and harden a bit.
3. Put the rest of the ingredients into a blender and blend for a few minutes. Then pour on top of the caramel mixture in the pan. Place the cake pan into a larger casserole or round glass dish and fill the larger pan with water until the water comes up to about halfway on outside of the cake pan. This is called a bain-marie or bano de maria in spanish. Place this into the oven and bake for about an hour or until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean.
4. Place cake pan in refrigerator to cool for about 5 hours to overnight. If you're in a huge hurry you can also leave it in the bain-marie but dump the water and refill with cool water then add some ice cubes to this and place in refrigerator. If the ice cubes melt add some more removing a bit of water if necessary so as not to cause overflow. This could be ready in an hour or two if the ice is replenished often.
5. Alternatively I'll sometimes do this in two loaf pans and place both into a large casserole dish. In that case sprinkle enough sugar to coat the bottom of each pan lightly.,

instructions, 1. You will need a small pot with a lid. A capacity of 1 to 3 quarts is good.
2. Bring the water to a strong boil at highest temperature.
3. Add the rice to the boiling water. Swirl the rice once with a spoon so that it covers the bottom of the pot uniformly.
4. Watch the rice boil until you see the bubbles form a pock-marked pattern with its vigorous boiling. This takes 1 to 2 minutes.
5. Lower the heat to simmer. About 2.5 out of 10 on the dial is about right on my stove. Your stove may need to be set slightly higher or lower. You want the heat to be high enough so that steam is always being formed in the pot but not so hot that the rice scorches on the bottom of the pot.
6. When the boiling dies down a bit cover the pot and set the timer to 20 minutes.
7. Remove the lid of the pot and your rice is done. For your first batch test the rice with a fork and give it a taste test. It should be fluffy and tender.
8. (The texture of fried rice benefits from a firmer rice kernel. Use 1 1/2 cups of water instead of 1 2/3 cups of water to achieve this texture. When it is done leave the lid off the pot and allow the rice to cool. Then use the cooled rice in your fried rice recipe. The cooling is optional.).,

instructions, 1. Just place the ingredients in your preferred order and manner and top with the ketchup mayonnaise and mustard.
2. Of course all of these ingredients may be increased decreased or omitted to suit your personal taste. (For instance you might add a scrambled egg and take out the onion.).
3. However eating this delicious but ugly dog is also an art which includes covering part of it with a grated white or favorite cheese topping and your favorite sauce such as: an avocado sauce or barbecue sauce or a garlic dip or red hot sauce etc.
4. Once finished repeat the process by adding another topping of grated white cheese and cover with ANOTHER favorite sauce --  and so on until you finish the hot dog. This step is optional but it's very popular amongst most eaters.
5. I guess you could probably replace the white cheese with Monterrey; although I haven't tried it.,

instructions, 1. Combine the flour oil egg salt and sugar in a bowl.
2. While kneading add a tablespoon or two of water.
3. At first it just makes a mess but as you knead it it starts to take shape.
4. Keep kneading until it does not stick to your hands.
5. If you need to take the dough out of the bowl and knead it on a floured cupboard adding flour until the dough does not stick to your hands.
6. Let the dough rest for 1-2 hours .
7. While the dough is resting cut the cheese into strips into a finger-like shape.
8. They should be maybe 1/2" by 1/2" by 3".
9. Don't make the"fingers" too long or they will be more difficult to use later.
10. After the dough has rested shape it into balls slightly larger than your fist.
11. Roll them out until they are 1/4-0.125 inch thick.
12. Cut the rolled-out dough into long strips that are 3/4" wide.
13. Wrap the cheese"fingers" with the dough strips.
14. Make sure you cover all the cheese and seal the dough because otherwise the cheese will leak out of the dough when you are frying it.
15. After you have wrapped the cheese in dough dust the uncooked"tequeños" with flour and fry them in oil.
16. These are (obviously) fattening but they are delicious!,

instructions, 1. If you're lazy like me youll just sift the cornmeal and salt in a bowl together then gradually add the water. If you want a finer-ground texture and/or possess a dishwasher you'll want to ground the cornmeal and sea salt in a food processor first to get it really fine.
2. Either way sift the two ingredients in a bowl together and gradually add the warm water until a stiff dough forms.
3. Add the manchego cheese and knead for a few minutes then roll the whole mixture into a giant ball. Add a little more water if you need to if it's falling apart/too crumbly but add more cornmeal if too watery.
4. Lightly dust a surface (like a sil-pat) with some cornmeal and place the giant ball on it. Roll out with your hands or a rolling pin to be about 1/4" thick.
5. You can make the arepas any size I got about 6 medium size ones out of this. I divided the dough into 6 pieces with a pizza cutter then placed the desired amount of mozzarella cheese into them.
6. Carefully fold each arepa over making sure the edges are totally closed. They're supposed to be pretty thin but make sure they're holding up that cheese in the middle. Don't crimp with a fork it's likely to come apart just use your hands.
7. Heat a little olive or canola oil in a frying pan and cook each arepa for 3-4 minutes on each side until browned.
8. They're tasty by themselves but I love them with a good black bean soup and basic lettuce and tomato salad. Salsa and red almond dipping sauce make good dips too!,

cuisine, Latin American >> South American >> Argentine, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Meat  --  If you have left over meat don't worry. If not make sure to saute it ahead of time.  Just use a little olive oil in a pan to saute on medium heat until done and then set to the side to drain and cool.
2. Vegetables  --  if you cooked your meat in that pan you may have a little oil left to saute your vegetables if not  --  add a little olive oil to cook your vegetables. Add them and saute 4-5 minutes until soft. Remember they won't cook much in the oven and you want most of the water cooked out of them. They also should be set to the side drained and cooled.  You don't want extra water in the calzone to make it soggy.
3. Crust  --  Just roll out your pizza dough. Pillsbury comes in a rectangle so roll out as flat as you can make it. Add a little flour to your counter top or  cutting board so the dough doesn't stick. I like ro roll out with a rolling pin to get in even and spread out.  It should be about 13x9 each can or 14 oz of dough. Then with a 6" bowl right from your kitchen cabinet  --  press down on the crust to make as many calzones as possible. This recipe will make right about 8 for both rolls. Any left over crust just add all together and press down again to maybe get one more calzone.
4. Stuffing  --  Add some of the cooled meat then the vegetables and cheese.  Now put a little water on your finger and moisten 1/2 the edge of each circle.  Then fold the circle over to make a half circle. The water will just make it stick together good. Press together well to seal and then use a fork to press the edges down even more and make a nice decorative edge.
5. Bake  --  Brush a little olive oil if you want on the calzones to make a crisp crust (optional). Transfer the calzones to a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper or foil and bake at 450 for about 15 minutes until golden brown. One batch I made took 20 the other 15 so just keep an eye of them. Serve with a good Marinara.
6. And remember any mix of fillings broccoli ham cheese; bacon cheddar and onion; or chicken spinach and mozzarella. Just think what is left in your fridge. Six dollars for pizza dough and marinara and you can make a great use of leftovers and with some soup in your freezer you have a whole new dinner.,

instructions, 1. ** These are just suggestions so please add more or less  depending on your taste.  I like my chili spicy so I tend to add more chili powder cayenne and black pepper.
2. Saute garlic over med. heat using a little liquid so your garlic won't burn.  Add beef and let brown be sure to keep moving it around so it doesn't burn since this is EXTRA Lean beef and there is practically no fat. Add more liquid if you need to about a Tablespoon at a time.
3. While meat is browning dice up tomato and puree in blender add a little broth or water to help it move around a little in the blender if  needed.
4. Once meat is brown add the tomato puree and 1/2 cup of the  liquid.  Begin adding spices try a little at a time if you are unsure  and then add by taste.  Let the chili simmer on med/low heat for  about 15 min or until it reaches the consistency you like.  I like mine a little thicker so I let it cook about 15 minute.

3. Add crumbled sausage and reduce heat to a low simmer until beef cubes are tender another ½ to 1 hour stirring every 15 minutes.
4. The wheat bran flakes add no taste but makes the chili thicker and the fiber content is good for digestion.
5. Most chili recipes use coarsely ground beef.  This one uses ¼ inch cubes of beef which would be like very very coarsely ground beef.  It gives the dish a unique heavier texture and this recipe is a little soupier than most chili recipes.  I now use a #22 meat grinder with a grinder plate that has 3/4 inch holes to grind the beef instead of spending the lengthy time to dice the beef into 1/4 inch cubes.,

instructions, 1. For the pretzels dissolve the yeast in 1 1/4 cup warm water and let sit for a few minutes.
2. Combine flour powdered sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl.  Add the yeast mixture and the oil.  Stir until the dough comes together and then turn out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead for at least 5 minutes until smooth and elastic.  Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl cover and set in a warm place for about 45 minutes or until dough has doubled in size.
3. Preheat oven to 425 and spray a baking sheet with non-stick spray.
4. Make the bath for the pretzels by combining the baking soda and 2 cups warm water.  Stir until mostly dissolved.
5. Take dollops of dough and roll them into balls.  They won't actually stay in perfect balls; they just need to be sort of rounded on top to make a bun.  I made mine about 2" diameters and got about 40 out of the dough.  Dip each ball into the baking soda bath then blot on a paper towel just for a second to get rid of the drips.  Place 12 on a sheet and sprinkle with the kosher or pretzel salt.  Bake for 4 minutes spin the pan around and bake for another 3-4 minutes or until golden brown.  If desired brush with melted butter.
6. When cooled slice each roll in half to make the bun.
7. To make the mustard sauce combine the dijon mustard mayo yellow mustard horseradish worchestershire pepper and vinegar.  Taste sauce and alter to your preferences.
8. Assemble sandwiches with sauce roast beef and caramelized onions.  Buns can be made ahead of time and stored in an air-tight container.  Once the sauce is on the bun the soggy factor will kick in if stored so only assemble what you plan to eat.,

instructions, 1. Make the Dough:  Process the flour sugar and salt together in a food processor until combined about 6 seconds. Scatter the butter pieces over the flour mixture and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with butter bits no larger than small peas about 16 pulses.
2. Transfer the flour mixture to a large mixing bowl. Working with 1/4 cup of water at a time sprinkle the water over the flour mixture and stir it in using a rubber spatula pressing the mixture against the side of the bowl to form a dough until no small bits of flour remain (you may not need to use all of the water).
3. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Press each dough half into a cohesive ball then flatten the ball into a 6-inch disk. Wrap each disk in plastic and refrigerate until firm but not hard about 2 hours or up to 2 days.
4. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. Remove 1 disk of dough from the refrigerator (if refrigerated longer than 2 hours let sit at room temperature until malleable). Roll the dough out on a lightly floured work surface into an 18-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick. Using a 3-inch round biscuit cutter cut out 24 rounds and transfer them to the prepared baking sheet. Wrap the baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Repeat with the second disk of dough and the second prepared baking sheet.
5. Make the Filling:  Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just shimmering. Add the onion and cook until softened 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste garlic oregano cumin cloves and cayenne and cook until fragrant about 30 seconds. Stir in the beef and cook breaking up the clumps with a wooden spoon until no longer pink about 4 minutes.
6. Stir in the broth reduce the heat to low and simmer until the mixture is moist but not wet about 8 minutes. Off the heat stir in the sugar and season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely cool about 1 hour. Stir in the cheese and continue to chill until needed up to 3 days.
7. Assemble the empanadas:  Working with the first batch of dough rounds place about 1 teaspoon of the chilled filling in the center of each dough round and moisten the edge of the dough round with water using either your finger or a pastry brush. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half-moon shape. Pinch the seam along the edge to secure. Using a dinner fork crimp the sealed edge to secure. Arrange them on a fresh parchment-lined baking sheet. Wrap the baking sheet tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate while making a second batch of empanadas using the remaining dough rounds and filling.  Follow freezing instructions at this time if making ahead.
8. To serve: Adjust 2 oven racks to the upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Unwrap the empanadas and brush with the egg and bake until golden brown about 20 minutes switching and rotating the trays halfway through the baking time. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.,

Place the ribs on a rack in a roasting pan (I didn't have one so I laid 3 ribs of celery lengthwise in a 9 x 13 baking dish and put my ribs on top of the celery). Pour 3 cups of water into the pan and cover the pan with foil. Bake the covered ribs for 30 minutes.
2. Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven (watching out for the hot liquid in the bottom of the pan).  Remove the ribs to a platter and drain off all the accumulated liquid from the pan wiping the pan dry and lowering the oven temperature to 300 degrees.
3. Return the ribs to the pan. Using approximately 1/4 cup BBQ sauce per pound brush the BBQ sauce over the top of the ribs. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes.
4. Remove the ribs from the oven turn them over and baste top with another 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce per rib. Return to the oven and bake for an additional 20 minutes.
5. Remove from the oven and turn the meatiest side up baste with remaining BBQ sauce. Preheat the top Broiler to 500 degree and place the ribs about 6 inches under the broiler. Allow the ribs to broil for a few minutes caramelizing the BBQ sauce and then remove them from oven and serve!,

instructions, 1. Once all the ingredients are prepped and assembled this goes very quickly so if you're serving rice and a green vegetable on the side (as I did I used broccoli) make sure you have all that under control before you start this.
2. First zest one of the oranges into a small bowl then squeeze its juice into the same bowl; add the garlic and soy into the bowl lightly stir then set aside.
3. A little minced fresh ginger added to the garlic mixture would be excellent too as would some garlic-chili sauce or a little tabasco or cayenne pepper.
4. Now take the two remaining oranges and with a sharp paring knife peel the oranges then slice crosswise into 1/2 inch slices then halve the slices.
5. Pick out and discard any seeds from the orange slices then set the oranges aside.
6. This is not a recipe in which to use a lesser cut of meat go for the sirloin or perhaps rib eye; I used new york striploin steak since my grocery store had them on sale.
7. Slice steak against the grain into 1/2-inch-thick slices then toss with the cornstarch.
8. Slice the green onions into 1-inch lengths (the original recipe called for the green parts only but I used the whole thing with the white parts cut thinly) and set aside.
9. Now you're ready to cook; heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over high heat.
10. Working in batches (add more oil if needed) brown beef; it takes about 3 to 5 minutes per batch.
11. Transfer browned beef to a plate.
12. Pour the juice mixture into the skillet and keeping the heat at high let it boil for about one minute or until it's syrupy.
13. Return beef to skillet along with the orange slices and the green onions.
14. Toss until everything is coated with the sauce and the oranges have heated through (about a minute or so); serve hot.,

3. Remove meat and add onion to pot and brown for a few minutes to release flavors.  (Ensure the onions stay relatively intact because they will be used as a bed to prop up the roast during the braising process.).
4. Next add the garlic and constantly stir to release flavor (do not burn) for about one minute.
5. Add the pureed tomatoes and stir scraping bottom of pot to release any stuck on bits.
6. Next add 4 of the bouillon cubes the 2 bay leaves 20 turns of fresh ground pepper and a bundle of fresh thyme.

Taste and add additional salt and fresh black pepper if needed.  Let covered pot sit on cool stove for 5-10 minutes so meat can be warmed up and fresh thyme bundle can flavor the soup.
15. Remove thyme bundle.  To serve add a scoop of cooked egg noodles into soup bowl and cover with beef vegetable soup.  Serve with biscuits or crusty warm bread.,

7. In the meantime prepare your dippers: I prefer cold raw veggies such as celery cucumber Belgian endive and cauliflower but hot dip works well with crisply-steamed cauliflower broccoli brussels sprouts or green beans too (the hot dip against the cool raw vegetable is a nice contrast). Any veggies you like would probably be fine but remember that if you're aiming for lower-carb that vegetables aren't carb-free by any means. After fiber subtraction about 7-9 carbs per serving.
8. If you're not lower-carbing this stuff is just plain good.  :)  Dip in with whatever you want... pita chips bread pieces and so on.  So very very good!  A little decadent party living!,

instructions, 1. MAKE THE DOUGH: In a food processor pulse the flour with the sugar and salt. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Beat the eggs with the wine and vinegar and drizzle over the flour mixture. Pulse until the dough just comes together. On a lightly floured work surface gently knead the dough until smooth. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate until firm about 1 hour.
2. PREPARE THE FILLING: In a medium skillet heat the oil. Add the achiote seeds and cook over moderately high heat until the seeds darken and the oil is orange about 1 minute. Discard the seeds. Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon until no pink remains about 3 minutes. Add the garlic onion and bell pepper and cook over moderate heat until the onion is softened about 5 minutes. Add the tomato tomato paste and chicken stock and simmer over moderate heat until the liquid has nearly evaporated about 3 minutes. Stir in the cilantro and season with salt and pepper. Let cool.
3. On a generously floured work surface roll out the dough 1/8 inch thick. With a 3-inch round biscuit cutter stamp out as many rounds as possible (you should have about 24). Reroll the dough scraps and stamp out additional rounds if possible. Brush the excess flour off the rounds. Working with 1 round at a time and keeping the rest covered with plastic wrap form the empanadas: Spoon 2 teaspoons of the filling on one side of the dough round. Fold the dough over to enclose the filling and crimp the edges with a fork to seal. Cover with plastic wrap while you form the remaining empanadas.
4. Preheat the oven to 350°. In a deep skillet heat 1/2 inch of oil to 350°. Fry 4 empanadas at a time turning once until browned and crisp 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels and transfer to a baking sheet. When all of the empanadas have been fried reheat them in the oven and serve.
5. MAKE AHEAD.
6. The filled uncooked empanadas can be frozen on a baking sheet then transferred to an airtight bag. Bake them in a 350° oven without thawing.
7. NOTES.
8. Alternatively you can bake the empanadas: Preheat the oven to 350°. Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of milk. Evenly space the uncooked empanadas on 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper and brush with the egg wash. Bake in the upper and lower thirds of the oven for about 25 minutes until golden brown.,

cuisine, Latin American >> South American >> Argentine, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Lets start with all the components and make them one at a time.
2. Horseradish Cream  --  Just mix the sour cream prepared horseradish (not creamy) vinegar and season with a little salt and pepper to taste.  Refrigerate until ready to use. The chives should be added right before serving.
3. Onions  --  To a medium to large sauce pan add the butter and olive oil and bring to medium heat. Add the onions and slowly begin to caramelize them - don't rush this. It will take a good thirty minutes but it isn't hard. After 5 minutes add a pinch of salt and sugar and continue to stir now and then.  After 15 minutes the moisture (water) from the onions will start to evaporate and the onions begin to caramelize. Once they get golden brown remove let cool and refrigerate until you are ready to use them. They can be reheated in the microwave in just a minute when you are ready to make the crostini.
4. Garlic Oil  --  In a small sauce pan on medium heat add the oil and garlic.  Cook for just a minute on medium and then reduce to medium low and simmer for about 20 minutes until the garlic is golden brown. Remove the garlic and you have wonderful garlic oil. You can always buy a bottle which is expensive and not nearly as good.
5. Beef   --  Add the beef broth and marsala to a small bowl to a small pan and heat until warm. Add in the beef slices and cook just a minute or two until the beef is warm. You don't want to over cook it it doesn't take long.
6. Crostini  --  Slice and grill or broil just until golden brown on each side. Remove and brush each slice with some of the garlic oil.
7. Onions  --  As the bread is toasting and the beef warming up - heat up your onions for just 1 minute in the microwave they are all done you just want them warm.
8. Horseradish Cream  --  Don't forget to stir in the chives right before you are ready to serve.
9. Toppings  --  Top each garlic crostini with some of the warmed caramelized onions then a slice or two of beef then a little of the horseradish cream.

instructions, 1. PLEASE NOTE: THESE ARE MAKE-AHEAD TACOS. YOU MUST FILL THEN FREEZE TACOS BEFORE FRYING FOR AUTHENTIC RESULTS.  PREPARE MY "COPYCAT JACK IN THE BOX TACO SAUCE" RECIPE (RECIPE #423994) BEFORE ASSEMBLING DEEP-FRIED TACOS.
2. POUR 3 cups cold water into a medium bowl; ADD the remaining SEASONING MIX ingredients (1 cup texturized soy protein 2 tablespoons defatted soy grits (or soy flour) 2 tablespoons tomato paste 4 teaspoons dried onion flakes 1 tablespoon plain chili powder 1 tablespoon masa corn flour 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon Accent seasoning 1 teaspoon garlic powder 3/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 1 dash ground black pepper 1 dash cayenne pepper 1 dash citric acid); WHISK mixture well until dry ingredients are thoroughly dissolved; SET aside.
3. BROWN the ground TACO BEEF in a skillet over medium-high heat while stirring without overcooking (drain ground beef if necessary); POUR the blended SEASONING MIX into the 1 lb browned TACO BEEF in skillet; RAISE heat to high and BOIL mixture for one minute stirring; REDUCE heat to medium  and COOK mixture stirring occasionally until very little liquid remains and ground beef is moist yet not soggy.
4. COVER beef mixture and reduce heat to low; SIMMER for 5-7 minutes to steam and tenderize meat and for flavors to infuse fully (ADD more water to refresh consistency if needed); TRANSFER filling to a food processor and process until fairly fine in texture: RETURN to skillet on lowest heat to keep warm.
5. DIVIDE enough needed American cheese slices diagonally; SHRED enough needed iceberg lettuce; HEAT 1/4 teaspoon vegetable oil in a skillet over low heat; TURN corn tortillas one at a time in a skillet on both sides until moistened and pliable (this helps tortillas from tearing); STACK prepared tortillas between paper towels to blot.
6. SPOON about 1 tablespoon of warm beef filling mixture into each tortilla; FOLD tortilla in half so bottom is curled; PRESS bottom filled half carefully without tearing tortilla using a taco press or makeshift mold ); LEAVE taco tops open by about 1 inch; CAREFULLY arrange filled formed tacos into Ziploc bags without crowding or touching; ARRANGE sealed tacos in a resealable plastic container to protect them from breakage; FREEZE overnight or until ready to deep-fry.
7. SLOWLY preheat deep-fryer with manufacturer's recommended amount of oil to 365°F .
8. FRY tacos one at a time for 55 - 65 seconds at 365 °F while supporting each taco with a taco press or tongs; PLACE cooked tacos on absorbent paper to drain slightly (I recommend one person frying and one person assembling for better efficiency and fresh hot tacos!).
9. TO ASSEMBLE TACOS: OPEN each fried taco carefully; POUR 1 teaspoon prepared Jack in the Box Copycat Taco Sauce (Recipe #423994); PLACE one cut American cheese triangle into one side; GARNISH with 2 tablespoons shredded iceberg lettuce.
10. ENJOY your Jack in the Box Tacos and say "EAT YOUR HEART OUT JACK!".,

time, ,

instructions, 1. In separate bowls marinate the steak chicken shrimp in 1 tablespoon each of sesame seed oil coconut aminos tamari and red pepper flakes.  Marinate for at least 1 hour.
2. For the Rice:  Use food processor or chop the cauliflower by hand until reduced to rice-size grains.  Sauté chopped onion in olive oil until onions are about done add garlic and continue to cook until onions are soft/opaque. Add chopped cauliflower and stir fry for 2 or 3 minutes--do not cook until soft but you don't want a raw cauliflower taste either.  Remove from heat.  This is the basic rice recipe and can be used any time a dish calls for rice.
3. Slice up the green onion heads and coarse shop the green stems put in separate piles.
4. In a bowl scramble the eggs and add to hot pan with a bit of oil.  Season with salt pepper pepper flakes and cook until a flat round "pancake."  Remove and slice into strips.
5. In a tablespoon of oil stir fry the beef and chicken separately and remove from heat.
6. Assemble all the ingredients near by so once you start putting it all together you don't have to stop.  You should have cooked beef cooked chicken raw shrimp sliced onion heads chopped stems carrots strips fried egg strips and cauliflower rice (pre cooked).  You should also have 1 tablespoon each of coconut aminos tamari fish sauce and Thai chilies (or any other hot chili like ghost or habanero).
7. Heat 3 tbl of olive oil add thai chilies and toss for 1 minute  Add the shrimp and stir fry until cooked.  Add carrots and stir fry for 1 minute.  Add green onion tops and stir for 30 more seconds.  Add beef and chicken and the remaining coconut aminos tamari and fish sauce.  Toss until warmed then add the cauliflower rice.  Toss until coated and warmed then add the green onion stems.  Toss for a minute more and remove.
8. To plate:  Put generous pile in center of plate place 4 tomato wedges around the pile all "pointing" to the center.  Surround the pile with 5 or 6 sliced cucumbers.

instructions, 1. Add the ground beef back to the skillet used for browning.  Mix in the remaining ingredients in the "Meat and Seasoning" grouping.  Heat on medium low until almost all of the liquid has been reabsorbed by the meat.  Remove the meat to a large mixing bowl.  Use the same skillet to prepare the mushrooms and onions.
2. In the skillet from the meat brown the onion until it's translucent.  Add the mushrooms and 2 cups of water.  Cook covered on medium high until the water has dissipated somewhat.  When you stir the mushrooms you should be able to see the pan bottom.  Add the remaining 2 cups of water and cook down again.  While mushrooms are in initial stage of cooking move on to the next steps.
3. Bring to boil 4 quarts water.  Add pasta.
4. Set broccoli in a deep ceramic or glass bowl with room on top for a collendar or sieve.  When pasta has finished cooking pour the pasta into the collendar.  The hot water will cook the broccoli perfectly.  Remove the pasta and collendar.  Add pasta to mixing bowl with meat.
5. Let the broccoli sit in the hot water for 5 - 7 minutes depending on how well cooked you like your broccoli.  Use a glass or ceramic bowl because it holds the heat longer than a metal or plastic bowl.  Drain broccoli and use collendar again for next step.  Add broccoli to mixing bowl.
6. Set the diced tomatoes to drain.  Reserve the juices for another use.  After fully drained remove tomatoes to bowl with meat.
7. Brown the minced garlic in the butter.  Whisk the flour into the evaporated milk.  When the garlic begins to brown whisk the milk and flour mixture into the butter and garlic.  Bring to a light boil.
8. Add the fresh skim milk and whisk again.  Bring back to a light boil.  Add cream cheese and stir until melted.  Reduce heat to medium low.  Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until melted.  Add seasonings and stir well.  Add shredded cheddar and stir until combined.  Let sit to melt the cheese.
9. Add the cooked mushrooms and onion mixture to the mixing bowl.  Pour the sauce over all.  Carefully using a silicone spoonula scrape down the sides of the bowl and fold ingredients to coat.  Take care not to break the pasta apart.,

instructions, 1. Make the marinade:
2. Pour the oil into a 2-cup measure. Add the soy sauce. Squeeze the lemon juice through a small strainer (to catch the seeds) into the measuring cup. Add the Worcestershire sauce mustard and black pepper. Whisk to blend well. Peel and coarsely chop the garlic; stir it into the oil mixture.
3. Place the beef cubes in a 1-gallon freezer-weight zipper-top plastic bag. Whisk the marinade again to recombine. Pour the marinade into the bag with the beef. Seal the bag and gently shake to coat the meat with marinade. Place the bag flat in the refrigerator to marinate 8 to 24 hours. Turn the bag over once halfway through or more often if possible.
4. Place about four cubes on each skewer (depending on the size of the cubes) leaving a little space between the cubes for even cooking. Place the kebabs on a plate or tray. Discard the marinade. (The prepared kebabs may be refrigerated covered up to 6 hours).
5. Turn on a gas grill to medium-high. Grill the kebabs turning frequently to desired doneness. Cooking times will vary depending on the size of the meat cubes and the grill. (In our testing we found 7 to 8 minutes produced medium-rare meat for 1 1/4-inch to 1 1/2-inch cubes). Serve at once.
6. Note: If using bamboo skewers soak them in water for at least 30 minutes before assembling the kebabs so the skewers don't scorch on the grill. The number of skewers you will need depends on the size of your meat cubes. Cubes typically weigh about 1 ounce each and we serve four cubes of meat per person for average appetites.
7. Start to finish: 15 minutes preparation plus 8 to 24 hours unattended marinating time and 7 to 8 minutes grilling time.,

instructions, 1. For the sauce put the peeled garlic roma tomatos jalapenos and 1 can of coconut milk into a blender and puree til smooth. Set aside.
2. In a large heavy bottomed pot heat 1 T oil  over med-hi heat and saute the onion til soft about 4 mins and add a pinch of salt. Remove the onion a put to the side.
3. Put the pot back onto to the heat and turn up a bit then add half the beef browning it on all sides about 5 minutes. Remove the beef and add the rest of the beef and do the same with it. When finished return the previously browned beef back to the pot and pour in the sauce as well as the other can of coconut milk and bring to a light simmer. At this point reduce the heat  to a temp that allows the beef and sauce to simmer very gently.
4. Add the 1 tsp of salt and the others spices as well as the ketjap manis.
5. You will need to stir now and again to keep the sauce from sticking and burning to the bottom.
6. About 40 mins in add the sauted onions.
7. This will take about a little over an hour to thicken into a thick sauce and tenderize the beef. I have had it even take a bit longer.
8. When finished the dish will be a much darker color and have a much thicker sauce than when you began preparing it. Taste sauce and adjust seasonings-add extra ketjap manis and/or salt if needed.
9. Serve it over your favorite rice. I often top mine with chopped cilantro and a scoop of plain yougurt-but my sister in law doesn't.

time, ,

instructions, 1. Meat  --  Now I use a baggie for this but a small bowl or pan will work fine.  I just mix the flour salt and pepper in a baggie and toss the meat and dredge.
2. Saute  --  Now in a large pot heated to medium high add the olive oil and cook the meat until golden brown.  DON'T forget shake off most of the flour before you add it to the oil.  The meat should take about 5-7 minutes until brown on each side.  Remove to a plate while you prepare the vegetables.
3. Vegetables  --  In the same pot as you cooked the meat add a little more olive oil and saute the onions parsnips celery root mushrooms and garlic.  Cook 10 minutes until they begin to soften.
4. Broth  --  Add the beer to deglaze the pan and stir up all the good bits on the bottom of the pan.  Add in the beef broth seasoning and simmer 1 hour covered and 1/2 hour uncovered so the broth reduces a bit.  You want a nice thick stew not too runny. After 1 1/2 hours the meat should be falling apart.
5. NOTE:  If you like your stew a bit thicker just mix a little corn starch and water to make a slurry and add to a medium heat stew and it will thicken right up.  Just a tablespoon or so should be plenty.
6. Topping  --  Now transfer the stew to a 13x9 baking dish sprayed with Pam.  Now roll out your crescent rolls (1 can at a time) on a counter top with a little flour so they don't stick or on a cutting board.  Press the seams together and then I take my rolling pin and just roll it a couple of times to make a nice flat sheet.
7. Now I like to cut my flat sheet of dough into 8 strips and then lay them across the pie like a checker board.  The two crusts make a really pretty presentation.  Now if you don't like the checker board pattern just add it in strips.  Anyways you like.  Just remember if you put on a solid piece of crust poke some holes with a fork on the top so the crust can breath.  Just like a pie crust.
8. Butter and Cheese Glaze  --  The best part just melt for 10 second in the microwave the butter and blue cheese with the seasoning.  Just enough to make it soft but not liquid.  Then brush the blue cheese butter on the crust.
9. Bake  --  400 for about 17-20 minutes until the crust is done and golden brown.  Then just ENJOY!  Rich hearty stew falling apart with a golden flaky crust.,

Pour all sauce over the ribs cover and braise in the oven at 325 for 3 hours.
2. When finished remove ribs and keep warm.  Strain the vegetables from the sauce reserving 3/4 cup and return to the stove on medium high heat.   Combine cold water and flour in equal parts whisk into reserved sauce then whisk this into the remaining sauce to slightly thicken.  When done plate the ribs and ladle sauce onto the ribs.

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 450-degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Pull back the fat cap from the roast and brush the meat all over with some of the stock.
3. Coat the meat all over with half of the pickling spice and rub it inches.
4. Combine the black pepper and garlic powder with the salt then divide this mixture in half and sprinkle half of it over the meat.
5. Leave the onions in whole rings and layer them over the meat.
6. Return the fat cap to its original place.
7. Tie the roast back together with kitchen twine at 2-inch intervals.
8. Place the meat in a large deep roasting pan making sure that fat cap is facing up.  Pour the remaining stock into the pan.
9. Season the outside of the meat with the remaining pickling spice and remaining spice-salt mixture.
10. Roast for 20-25 minutes (at 450-degrees Fahrenheit).  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F and roast for an additional 1 hour 15 minutes - 1 1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 130-degrees F for rare or 140-degrees F for medium-rare or longer if you prefer but be careful not to over-cook so it won't be over-done and dry.  (The best way  to acquire perfect results is by using a reliable meat thermometer).
11. Remove the meat from the oven and let sit in a warm place for 20 minutes before slicing (this will help the beef retain its juices therefore resulting in juicy/moist meat.  If it is sliced right away the juices are released prematurely).
12. Slice the roast discarding the fat cap and serve.,

instructions, 1. Cut a pattern of incisions across the top of the roast every couple of inches each long and deep enough to hold a slice of salt pork. Combine half the garlic 1 cup of the onion (mince this finely) and 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper and push this mixture into the slits you've made for the salt pork. Press salt pork into the beef and tie it securely trying to make the shape of the roast as even as possible for even cooking.
2. In a pot broad and deep enough to hold the roast with room to spare for all the braising liquid melt the lard over medium heat. Brown the roast well all around keeping the salt pork inside. Add all remaining seasonings carrots celery parsley and thyme to the pot cooking until the onions are limp. Add wine and enough hot beef stock or water to nearly cover beef. Add bones. Cover pot and simmer 4 hours until beef is very tender.
3. Remove beef from pot to another dish that will hold dripping juices. Raise heat under liquid and boil hard uncovered 45 minutes. While boiling down the gravy baste the roast so it doesn't dry out.
4. Remove salt pork strips from beef and slice it as best you can (it will fall into chunks and shreds; the smaller you shred it the more it'll be like the legendary "debris") putting the pieces into a separate serving or storage dish. Strain the gravy season it to taste with salt freshly ground pepper and optionally a small pinch or two of cayenne and pour it over the beef. There should be about a quart of gravy. The resulting mixture should be sloppy luscious and profoundly beefy.
5. Serve on fresh crisp crusted New Orleans-style French bread -- average po-boy size is at least nine inches. Make sure the French bread (a good baguette will do) is not chewy. The bread must be crispy on the outside and light on the inside. Serve your roast beef po-boys dressed (with lettuce tomatoes pickles etc.) or with nuttin' on it but "mynez" (mayonnaise that is) really is a must. I like mixing plenty of horseradish into my mayonnaise by the way. Optionally you could serve this as a plate lunch or dinner with vegetables and potatoes as well.,

instructions, 1. Have the butcher grind the meat twice then mash it in a mortar to make sure it is completely pulverized or use a food processor. Set the meat aside together with any juices.
2. Heat the oil in a skillet and saute the onions and green pepper or 1-2 hot peppers until the onions are softened. Add the tomatoes and cook until the mixture is thick and well blended about 5 minutes longer. Cool the mixture slightly.
3. Put the beef and its juices into a saucepan. Stir in the sauteed onions green pepper or hot peppers and tomatoes known as the sofrito and 8 cups cold water. Mix well.
4. Bring to a boil over moderate heat stirring with a wooden spoon. Add the rice or noodles and simmer still stirring until tender about 15 minutes. At this point season to taste with salt. If salt is added earlier the meat and the liquid which should be completely blended may separate.
5. Some cooks believe that constant stirring is the most important step others believe the adding of salt is the important factor.
6. Superstition has it that if anyone who does not enjoy cooking is present in the kitchen they may cause the So'O-Yosopy to separate and spoil the dish.
7. Serve with a baked sweet potato or a thick slice of broiled yucca (cassava) or both and Sopa Paraguay Paraguayan Corn Bread. Recipe for corn bread is posted.

2. 2. Start on the spanish rice first as it will take the longest. In a pot put rice salsa and water. Bring to a boil reduce heat to medium low and cover. Cook for about 17-19 minutes.
3. 3. Begin to brown ground beef in a pan add all seasoning and cook until browned. May need to drain fat depending on how you like your beef. Don't worry about getting your meat a little spicier than you might normally like it because combining all these will tame down your meat and make the overall meal better.
4. 4. While the meat is browning you can start the beans. In a sauce pan heat up the oil. I drain almost all of the liquid out of the can and put it the pan. I add the garlic powder after the beans and real garlic before.
5. 5. When all are finished cooking I mix in a large bowl and mix in the cheese. I spray a 9x13 pan. I fill the tortillas and wrap them up like burritos and put them in the pan. I put it in the oven for about 15 minutes. We usually just add salsa on top of it.
6. 6. If you're going to freeze put in a plastic bag and lay flat in the freezer. I would thaw them out the day you're going to cook them. You may need to cook them a little longer if they're cold out of the refrigerator.,

instructions, 1. First trim as much fat as you can from meat.  Place in a slow cooker.
2. In a blender add about 1 cup of water.  Blend cilantro garlic (i usually use all of the bulb) onion salt and pepper with water. (you can use as much or as little spices you want depending on your taste).
3. Pour this mixture over meat then add about 2-3 cups of more water depending on how much meat you are cooking.
4. Cook meat in slow cooker on low for about 8 -10 hours.  Again this depends on how much meat you have.
5. If you are going to eat this for breakfast (which is the traditional way) cook the day before and let is cool overnight. (I usually start cooking mine on Saturday AM until about 6PM then let it cool.  When cool enough I refrigerate overnight).
6. In the morning (Sunday AM) BEFORE heating up skim all the grease that comes to the top.
7. TOPPINGS:  Chopped tomatoes chopped onions chopped fresh cilantro chopped fresh jalapenos shredded cheese & sliced avocados.
8. CHEEK MEAT:  Beef cheek meat is very tender but very very fatty.  You may want to buy more or less meat depending on the size.  You can use beef roast if you want but cheek meat is AWESOME (if you can find it).,

instructions, 1. Brown the ground pork and ground beef.  Add diced tomatoes raisins almonds onions cumin garlic cloves rice  and coriander. Mix well cover and simmer for 15 minutes. The water should be all absorbed if not remove lid and cook until only moist not watery. This can be done earlier than the rest of the steps refridgerate if using within a day or freeze if longer. Thaw before using.
2. The following steps must be done just prior to serving:
3. Because you are using fresh chiles they must be peeled as the batter will not adhere to the slick skins of the chiles/peppers. Do this by charring the chiles either over an open flame (use long fork or tongs over a gas burner) or under the broiler. Then steam them in a hot towel or a closed paper sack and when they are cool enough to touch remove the skins.  Slit the chiles lengthwise and remove seeds and veins using a teaspoon leaving the stem intact. Dredge the chiles in 1/4 cup of flour and shake off extra flour.
4. Prepare the batter by separating the whites from the yolks. Beat the whites very stiff. Beat the yolks and fold into beaten whites.  Fold in the 6 tbs of flour.
5. To complete the rellenos spoon the meat mixture into the chiles. Add some cheese.  Dip the chiles into the batter and fry at medium heat in 1 inch cooking oil in frying pan at medium high until light browned on both sides.  Use slotted spoon to place chile in oil and to turn and remove.
6. Serve with mild Picante sauce on top of Rellenos. (This can be purchased in any grocery store.

3. Sprinkle package of beef stew seasoning all over roast (like a rub).
4. Cook on low in crock pot for  20 - 24 hours.  Do not cheat on this the slow and low time is what makes this so much better than other roasts.
5. After about 1 hour the roast will start to defrost in crock pot and water will come out of frozen roast. Use this to baste the top of the roast to spread the seasonings.
6. Flip roast every few hours to ensure each side is under the fluid and no sides end up too crusty and seasonings are distributed.
7. When done the beef will look almost shredded.

instructions, 1. mix in a very large bowl: sausage meat eggs onion spices 4 tbsp Worcestershire butter milk bread crumbs & bread slices together (should be firm enough to form ball--add more bread crumbs or wet bread to help firm up).
2. Scoop out 1/4 cup meat and make into a round thick patty like ball.
3. *You really don't want it in a ball shape but more like a patty that is really thick*.
4. In a *hot* cast iron skillet on medium heat place a little olive oil--enough to coat the bottom of the pan don't add more than a tablespoons.
5. Fry each patty (about 5 or 6 at a time) in the pan until browned well on both sides.
6. Remove to a large pot--no need to drain and don't drain pan between each set of patties.
7. Meanwhile remove stems from mushrooms and set aside.  Slice the whole mushrooms and place in pot with meatballs.
8. Mince the stems and also put in pot along with garlic cloves kitchen bouquet 2 tbsp Worcestershire bay leaves and beef base.
9. Once all meatballs are done and in the larger pot you should have around 3 tbsp of fat in the bottom of the fry pan.
10. Add around 4 tbsp of flour (or enough to make a very wet paste when mixed with oil) you want to whisk it well and let get VERY brown add 2-3 cups of water to the roux and whisk to prevent lumps.
11. Continue to add enough water so that it appears to be a thin gravy--try and get those brown bits from the bottom of the pan!
12. This mixture should turn VERY Dark brown!
13. Pour the roux/gravy mixture into the large pot with the meatballs add enough water (if necessary) to cover all meat balls.  Put on medium heat until starts to boil and then turn down to a very low boil/simmer heat and cook for 1 1/2 hours stirring occasionally very carefully not to break up the meat balls.
14. Thicken gravy with cornstarch and water if desired.
15. Serve over rice or potatoes.
16. Because of the richness of the meat and the size of the balls you create 1-2 meatballs per person is usually enough.,

cuisine, Latin American >> South American >> Argentine, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. This works well for almost any size roast! I've used it for roasts as small as 3 and as large as 10 with nearly identical results. Best cuts to start with are large tender cuts of beef — such as a rib or sirloin roast. Sirloin-tip rump rolled-rump eye-of-round or top-round roasts will also benefit from this cooking method if they are graded prime or choice.
2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
3. Season roast with salt and pepper garlic salt steak seasoning or whatever you like including not at all. You can also add onions and/or carrots to your dish if you wish. They will be VERY well done but I think they are delicious.
4. Put the roast fat side down in a roasting pan or a Pyrex baking pan. I don't recommend using a rack under the meat but that's just my preference.
5. Put roast in oven for one hour. For a 7 PM meal you can start it as late as 11 AM; for a 6 PM you can start it as late as 10 AM and so forth. Or you can start it at whatever time you get up which is what I usually do since I leave for work at 8.
6. At the end of the hour turn the oven off BUT DON'T OPEN THE OVEN DOOR! If there are going to be people in the house during the day I put a note on the oven door saying DO NOT OPEN.
7. About an hour before your meal turn the oven back on to 375 degrees for 45 minutes. I usually put my potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil in at this time. At the end of the 45 minutes take the roast out and let it stand for 5 to 10 minutes. It's going to look burnt but the meat will be wonderful! The pan drippings make great gravy too!
8. Carve and enjoy!,

2. Dice/mince the green onions.
3. Add all of the ingredients to the softened cream cheese in a medium sized bowl. Stir. (I usually use my clean hands for this; a wooden spoon also works with a bit more effort). The ingredients should be consistent throughout the cheese ball.
4. Wrap in plastic wrap. Store in the fridge for at least 6-8 hours. This is one of those recipes that is at its best after sitting overnight. This way the flavors really blend.
5. Serve with crackers. My family likes Wheat Thins but it really goes with any type of cracker. Enjoy!,

9. *I have also tried this in a crock pot set on low for roughly six hours.  The roast came out much more tender and easier to shred but because they trap the liquid the sauce was much too runny for our taste.,

4. If you are like me and are trying to do this at the crack of dawn before racing out the door to the bus stop and then to work start here:
5. Plug in the crock pot.
6. Toss in the chopped onions garlic carrots squash and beef.
7. Stir in all the spices except the fresh cilantro.
8. Pour in the tomato sauce.
9. Cook on LOW for 6 – 8 hours.
10. About 15 minutes before it is going to be served or as soon as you get home:
11. add the peas cilantro and the olives.
12. Stir it all up and let cook another 15 minutes or so.
13. I served it over whole wheat couscous with a hunk of roasted garlic bread that Jeff picked up on the way home.  It was a hit – everyone decided it was a keeper and that the addition of the olives (the secret ingredient) was genius.  I loved the way it added a nice salty counterpart to the sweet squash.  If you wanted to you could also add a bit of chicken stock to the stew at the beginning.,

3. Fold the bottom inch of the tortilla up over the filling and then fold the sides tightly over the filling.
4. *Note: You can soften the tortillas by securely covering a large saucepan (that is half filled with boiling water) with a sheet of perforated foil (Poke holes and inch apart in the foil with a knife tip or a fork). Place each tortilla on top of the foil and allow it to steam just until the tortilla is soft and the underside is slightly sticky. Place the filling on the sticky side and when you fold the sides the stickiness will help the burrito to stay folded over the filling.,

3. Pour 1-3 tablespoons of marinade on each side of the meat. Allow to rest in refrigerator for at least 20-30 minutes - turning once during that time.
4. If grilling set grill to high setting.  You want to sear the meat to lock in the juices.  The marinade will help keep it from burning. Adjust heat as necessary and cook to preferred doneness (e.g. rare medium well).
5. I like to shake some lemon-pepper (preferably the kind without salt) on my steak or chops while cooking - it gives it a bit of zest.
6. Adjust marinade proportions to your preference.  You can also use real orange slices or pieces (use plenty) with some onion in the marinade in place of orange peel. Use leftover marinade to saute mushroom garlic and red pepper slices to top the meat.  Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. 1.  Heat oven to 392°F Place the beef on a roasting tray brush with 1 tbsp olive oil and season with pepper then roast for 15 mins for medium-rare or 20 mins for medium. When the beef is cooked to your liking remove from the oven to cool then chill in the fridge for about 20 minutes.
2. 2. While the beef is cooling chop the mushrooms as finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. You can use a food processor to do this but make sure you pulse-chop the mushrooms so they don't turn into mush.
3. 3. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil and all the butter in a large pan and fry the mushrooms on a medium heat with the thyme sprig for about 10 mins stirring often until you have a softened mixture. Season the mushroom mixture pour over the wine and cook for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. The mixture should hold its shape when stirred. Remove the mushroom mixture from the pan to cool and discard the thyme.
4. 4. Overlap two pieces of plastic wrap over a large chopping board. Lay the prosciutto on the plastic wrap slightly overlapping in a double row. Spread half the mushroom mixture over the prosciutto then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining mushroom mixture over it. Use the plastic wrap edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet then roll it into a sausage shape twisting the ends of plastic wrap to tighten it as you go. Chill the fillet while you roll out the pastry.
5. 5. Roll out a third of the pastry to a 7 x 12in strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet. Roll out the remaining pastry to about 11 x 14in. Unravel the fillet from the plastic wrap and place it in the center of the smaller strip of pastry and brush the pastry's edges and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet with beaten egg yolk. Using a rolling pin carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the fillet pressing well into the sides. Trim the edges to about a 1.5in rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle. Glaze all over with more egg yolk and using the back of a knife mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry. Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hours.
6. 6. Heat oven to 392°F Brush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk and cook until golden and crisp - 20-25 mins for medium-rare beef 30 mins for medium. Allow to stand for 10 mins before serving in thick slices.,

instructions, 1. The first step to making this delicious stew is to chop the carrots into bite-sized pieces. The next step is browning the bit-sized cubed beef until cooked all the way through in a skillet on medium heat; don't drain any of the grease you will use this to brown the Simply Potatoes. After the meat is brown you will then place it in a container to the side then put the Simply Potatoes Diced with onions in the skillet and cook until brown on medium heat. Then you will put the Potatoes into another container to the side (or if you read ahead and got a big enough container they can both go in).
2. The next step is place your soup pot on the stove and turn the heat on high and add the beef broth and tomato paste to your pot (you can add more tomato paste if you like your base to be thicker) and heat until boiling. Once your mixture is boiling turn down to simmer and add the carrots beef and potatoes and onions. The final step is to heat on simmer until carrots are cooked all the way through (approximately four hours) or for quicker meals heat on medium (approximately one hour).,
