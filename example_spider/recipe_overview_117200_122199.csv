instructions, 1. START WITH THE DOUGH.
2. Align the racks so the oven is divided into thirds. Preheat the oven to 375°F Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
3. In a heavy bottomed saucepan bring the milk water butter sugar and salt to a boil.
4. Add all of the flour at once reduce heat to medium and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon. The dough will come together quickly and may form a slight crust at the bottom of the pan which is perfect. Stir for 2-3 minutes to dry out the dough. The dough should be very soft and smooth.
5. Transfer the dough to a stand mixer (or I've mixed by hand just fine) with a paddle attachment and add the eggs one by one. If the dough separates after the first egg don't worry it should come back together by the time the third egg is incorporated. When all the eggs are incorporated the dough should be thin and fall back to the bowl in a ribbon when lifted.
6. Pour the dough into a piping bag and pipe onto baking sheets.
7. Bake in oven for 7 minutes then stick the handle of a wooden spoon in the door to keep it ajar. Bake for 5 more minutes then rotate the pans top to bottom back to front. Bake for approximately 8 more minutes (with the spoon in the door) until the eclairs are golden brown and puffy. Total baking time should be about 20 minutes.
8. Meanwhile make the pastry cream.
9. FOR THE CHOCOLATE PASTRY CREAM.
10. In a small saucepan bring the milk to a boil. While the milk is coming to a boil combine the yolks sugar and cornstarch together and whisk in a heavy bottom saucepan.
11. Once the milk has reached a boil temper the eggs by putting a little milk at a time into the egg mixture while whisking. Continue whisking and slowly pour the rest of the milk in the egg mixture.
12. Strain the mixture back into the saucepan to remove any egg that may have scrambled.  Place the pan over medium heat and whisk vigorously (without stop) until the mixture returns to a boil. Keep whisking vigorously for 1 to 2 more minutes (still over medium heat).Stir in the melted chocolate and then remove the pan from the heat.
13. Scrape the pastry cream into a small bowl and set it in an ice&#8208;water bath to stop the cooking process. Make sure to continue stirring the mixture at this point so that it remains smooth.
14. Once the cream has reached a temperature of 140 F remove from the ice&#8208;water bath and stir in the butter in three or four installments. Return the cream to the ice&#8208;water bath to continue cooling stirring occasionally until it has completely cooled. The cream is now ready to use or store in the fridge.
15. FOR THE VANILLA PASTRY CREAM.
16. Bring milk vanilla beans and vanilla pod to a simmer.
17. Meanwhile combine the sugar flour and cornstarch in a bowl. Whisk until smooth and then add the yolks whisking until lump-free.
18. Remove the vanilla pod from the milk.
19. Temper the egg mixture with the milk by pouring he milk little by little into the egg mixture while stirring to prevent scrambling.
20. Once the egg mixture is tempered return to the saucepan and bring to a boil.
21. Boil for 1 minute then remove from heat and stir in the butter. The cream is now ready to use or store in the fridge.
22. FOR THE CHOCOLATE SAUCE.
23. Place all the ingredients into a heavy&#8208;bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil making sure to stir constantly.  Then reduce the heat  to low and continue stirring with a wooden spoon until the sauce thickens.
24. It may take 10&#8208;15 minutes for the sauce to thicken but you will know when it is done when it coats the back of your spoon.
25. FOR THE CHOCOLATE GLAZE.
26. In a small saucepan bring the heavy cream to a boil. Remove from the heat and slowly begin to add the chocolate stirring with a wooden spoon or spatula.
27. Stirring gently stir in the butter piece by piece followed by the chocolate sauce.
28. TO ASSEMBLE THE ECLAIRS.
29. Slice the éclairs horizontally using a serrated knife. Set aside the bottoms and place the tops on a rack over a piece of parchment paper.
30. The glaze should be barely warm to the touch (between 95 – 104 degrees F or 35 – 40 degrees C as measured on an instant read thermometer). Spread the glaze over the tops of the éclairs using a metal icing spatula. Allow the tops to set and in the meantime fill the bottoms with the pastry cream.
31. Pipe or spoon the pastry cream into the bottoms of the éclairs. Make sure you fill the bottoms with enough cream to mound above the pastry. Place the glazed tops onto the pastry cream and wriggle gently to settle them.
32. Serve immediately.,

instructions, 1. In a 3-qt (or larger) bowl combine water yeast salt sugar and olive oil. Stir in flour with a wooden spoon or in a heavy-duty stand mixer with dough hook just until all the flour is incorporated; do not knead. Let stand at room temperature 2 hours or until it rises then collapses. (Dough may be used at this point or refrigerated for up to 5 days.).
2. Place an empty broiler tray or baking pan in the oven and preheat oven to 400°F
3. Divide dough in half and work with one piece at a time. Form the dough into a ball then flatten to about 1/2" thickness on a heavily-floured work surface. (This dough needs to be drier than most to hold the cut shapes so keep that in mind when adding bench flour.) Sprinkle with half the olives then roll up jelly-roll-fashion. Form into a ball then into a flat oval. Slice angled slits into the dough then gently pull them open. Transfer to a greased cookie sheet and brush with more olive oil. Let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.
4. Place the cookie sheet on a rack in the middle of the oven. Pour 1 cup hot water into the empty broiler pan and quickly close the oven door. Bake 20-25 minutes until puffy and golden brown (the crust will not get crackly hard because of the oil).
5. Repeat with remaining dough and remaining olives.,

instructions, 1. Trim fat from chicken breast halves.
2. Cut breast sections in half so that you have four roughly equal pieces.
3. Take a gallon zip top bag and cut the two edges open so that the sides are only joined at the bottom edge of the bag.
4. Place breast sections in bag one at a time and pound flat with a mallet or a flat heavy object until chicken pieces are only 1/4 to 1/2" thick.
5. Season breast sections on both sides with 1 tsp of fresh ground pepper and salt to taste.
6. Heat a frying or sauté pan to medium/medium high heat. Do NOT use a non-stick pan. You can't make decent pan sauces with Teflon. I prefer a stainless steel pan but cast iron would work (preferably enamel coated cast iron).
7. Put flour in a bowl and press breast pieces into it to coat chicken fully.
8. Add olive oil to pan and let it come up to temperature. It should only take a couple of seconds.
9. Add breast sections. Brown the chicken to a golden brown then flip and do the same on the other side. It should only take roughly 3 minutes per side or you have the chicken too thick. Do not crowd the pan. If you have to cook the chicken in batches keep the first batch warm by wrapping in aluminum foil.
10. While chicken is frying chop Italian parsley to 1/8 cup.
11. Remove the last batch of chicken from the pan and wrap in foil to keep warm.
12. Turn up heat under pan to medium high and add chicken broth. If pan is hot enough the broth will boil immediately. Use a wooden spoon to scrape all the brown bits off the bottom of the pan. This is where all the flavor is.
13. Add brandy lemon juice and remaining black pepper and then reduce liquid by 1/2.
14. Reduce heat to low and add butter and parsley. Stir in butter until sauce is smooth.
15. Place chicken pieces on plates and then pour the pan sauce over the chicken. Don't drown it.
16. Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Melt the 1 1/2 sticks of butter in a small pot over medium heat until it's brown and gives off a deliciously nutty aroma roughly 20 minutes. Strain (using a paper towel over a mesh strainer) - you want to leave the solids behind. Cool the butter to room temperature. By doing the butter first you can complete the rest of the steps while it is cooling.
3. While the melted butter is cooling use the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to grease the madeleine molds - get in there and make sure you get in all the ridges. Dust with flour and invert the pan tapping out any excess flour. Lanha uses "cooking spray" with flour to simplify this part.
4. Put the eggs with the salt in the bowl of an electric mixer with a whisk attachment. Whip on high speed until thick - you are looking for the eggs to roughly double or triple in volume - approximately 3 minutes. Continuing to mix on high speed slowly add the sugar in a steady stream. Whip for 2 minutes or until mixture is thick and ribbony. Now with a spatula fold the lemon zest and vanilla in (just until mixed).
5. Sprinkle the flour on top of the egg batter and gently fold in flour.  Now fold butter mixture into batter only stirring enough to bring everything together.
6. Spoon the batter into the molds filling each mold 2/3 –3/4 full. I use a small cup filled with batter to keep things clean and manageable it is easier than using a spoon.
7. Bake the madeleines for 12 - 14 minutes (7-10 minutes for smaller cookies) or until the edges of the madeleines are golden brown. Remove from oven and unmold immediately. Cool on racks and dust with powdered sugar.,

8. Spray a nonstick pan with oil and heat it up (not too hot!).

2. Next spray the casserole dish with a non stick spray and add the swiss chard and top with the sliced onions. Add some salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil (1 tablespoon).  Lightly toss.  Then top with the chicken broth and the 4 pork chops.
3. NOTE:  If you want you could pan sear the pork chops first if you want as one reviewer mentioned but I don't.  But if would give a nice color to the chops if you prefer.
4. Cheese  --  Sprinkle the cheeses on top of the swiss chard and onions around the pork chops.
5. Potatoes  --  In a small bowl add the potatoes remaining olive oil salt pepper and dried thyme and then add them on top of the swiss chard and cheese around the pork chops.
6. Bake  --  400 degrees for 20-30 minutes until the chops are done.
7. Garnish  --  I love to put a good balsamic vinegar on the table so each person can just drizzle a little on if they want.  For me the flavor is amazing.

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat oven to 350-degrees. In a large oven-proof skillet (I used cast-iron) heat the olive oil. Add the bacon if using and onion garlic and chard stems and cook over moderate heat stirring occasionally until the stems are softened about 5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce dried basil and crushed red pepper and simmer until the sauce is thickened about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
2. 2. Meanwhile in a large pot of salted boiling water blanch the chard leaves for 3 minutes. Drain and let cook slightly. Squeeze out the excess water. Form the chard leaves into 8 small piles and arrange them in the sauce around the side of the skillet. (I blanched and dried the chard in advance to make things easier--it'll keep for at least 30mins/1 hr).
3. 3. Crack the eggs into the skillet between the piles of chard. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake the eggs for 12 to 15 minutes until the egg whites are just set and the yolks are slightly runny.
4. 4. Transfer the skillet to a rack and sprinkle the cheese on top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Garnish with basil and serve immediately.
5. Note: I served with crusty bread which was great for dipping and making sure no sauce went to waste! You can use plain marinara but the arrabiata gave this a nice little kick--highly recommend it. I made without bacon and didn't miss it.,

instructions, 1. Weigh out ingredients for starter in your mixing bowl and whisk together. They should be the consistency of pancake batter.
2. Measure out the remaining bread flour and place on top of starter.
3. Make two little wells in the dry bread flour add the salt in one and the yeast in the other.
4. Place mixing bowl on its stand cover (loosely with plastic wrap or a lid) and let ferment for 1-2 hours. The yeast will become active during this time.
5. Measure out buttermilk and let stand until ready to use.
6. After the preliminary ferment add buttermilk to bowl and mix with a dough hook until a smooth elastic dough ball is formed about 5 minutes.
7. Turn the dough out onto a greased countertop (olive oil or Pam Spray works well).
8. Knead into a ball (1 minute) and place into a dough riser lightly coated with oil. Spray top of dough with oil cover and let rise for 2 hours or until doubled in size*.
9. Preheat oven with two pizza stones (one per shelf) to 450°F Be sure that the stones and a cookie sheet (bottom shelf) are in the oven when you start pre-heating it.
10. Turn bread dough out onto a lightly floured countertop and divide into four pieces. You can make four large loaves at this point or can continue on and divide each dough ball into 8 pieces.
11. Form the rolls and place them on 2 sheets of parchment paper that are roughly the same size as your pizza stones (16 rolls/sheet).
12. Cover** and let rise for 45 minutes.
13. After rising sprinkle the rolls with flour and slash the tops. ***.
14. Place the rolls in the oven using a pizza peel.**** At the same time put a cup of ice into the cookie sheet to humidify your oven.
15. Bake at 425F for 30-35 minutes. If your oven has a convection bake setting switch to convection for the last 10 minute of baking.
16. Cool on wire racks and enjoy!
17. *If you are not ready to form the rolls/loaves after the first rise you can punch the dough down and let it rise again until doubled in size. **I use a plastic storage container that is designed to store things under my bed. It is the perfect size and keeps my dough safe from cats dogs and other critters. ***A sharp serrated knife works well. ****An inverted cookie tray works in a pinch.,

instructions, 1. TO DO AHEAD steps 1 - 5 (about 30 - 45 minutes prep time:
Cut rind off Raclette cheese and slice about 1/4” thick and in a size to fit your raclette trays.  Slice the cheddar cheese the same way. Arrange on a platter cover and refrigerate.
2. Slice the Portobello mushrooms 1/4” thick (or buy already sliced).  Slice the peppers in long strips.  Put mushrooms and peppers into a Ziploc bag.  Mix or preferably emulsify together Good Seasons Italian dressing package with balsamic and olive oil.  Pour into the Ziploc close and gently shake to coat everything.  Marinate for no more than half a day.  Arrange on a platter (We put it on an oval one red pepper strips in the middle and mushrooms on each end - pretty!) cover and refrigerate.
3. Brown the sausages on all sides in a skillet.  When nice and browned boil them until just done still a little pink in the middle.  When they are cool enough to handle slice them about 1/4” thick and on a slight diagonal.  Arrange on a platter with the ham slices (step 4).
4. Separate the proscuitto and ham slices.  Cut them in half and arrange them on a platter - we took each slice and made a sort of rosette out of it so they were easier to pick up and put the sausages in the middle with the hams on either side.
5. Put shaved beef in a Ziploc bag.  Pour in your marinade of your choice close the bag and shake to mix well.  (We emulsified together some olive oil bourbon a garlic clove about a T. of Grey Poupon mustard a splash of balsamic and black pepper.)  Marinate for an hour to several hours.  Drain the marinade off the steak; try to separate the slices make “rosettes” and arrange on a platter BY ITSELF since it’s a raw meat; cover and refrigerate.
6. AN HOUR BEFORE EATING step 6:
Take everything out of the refrigerator (at least an hour before eating) so they’re room temperature.
7. ABOUT 20 MINUTES BEFORE EATING steps 7 - 9:
Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the potatoes till just done – fork tender but not falling apart.  Drain and place in a covered dish.
8. Put your greens in a salad bowl.  No more than 20 minutes before eating toss with your favorite vinaigrette (we made our own with wine vinegar olive oil salt pepper pinch of sugar and dried dill) orange sections and walnuts.
9. Turn on your Raclette grill.  I taped the grill's electric cord to the table so it wouldn’t be accidentally jerked off if someone tripped over the extension cord.  Of course I tripped over the cord - thank GOD it was taped down!
10. DINNER'S READY!!:
Put everything on the table and enjoy!  We used sandwich plates instead of dinner-size plates and everyone had their own salad bowl which we dished up and took to each person at the table.  We also used fondue forks for stabbing and grabbing.  DELICIOUS!!!  And a lot of fun!
11. For those of you who've not done this yet:
Each person takes the cheese they want and what they want to grill on the top of the raclette maker and then"cooks" his own meal.  The Raclette (or cheddar) cheese is melted in small pans underneath the grill top.  When the cheese is melted it is poured over the potatoes.  The meats and veggies are grilled on the top of the appliance. DELICIOUS!!,

instructions, 1. Steak  --  First prepare the meat. Cut the steak into several pieces and then pound fairly thin. Once pounded add flour salt and pepper to a large baggie and then dredge each piece of the round steak and get ready to pan sear.
2. Meat -- In a large saute pan heat to medium high and add the olive oil. Add the meat dredged in flour a few pieces at a time to cook. Saute each piece until golden brown just a couple of minutes per side. Once all done remove to a plate while you cook the vegetables.
3. Vegetables -- In the same pan add a little bit more olive oil just a teaspoon and saute the onions peppers carrots celery and mushrooms and cook 3-4 minutes until lightly soft then return the meat to the pan.
4. Sauce  --  In a small bowl add the broth soup tomato paste diced tomatoes worcestershire herbs salt and pepper and mix well. Add this to the pan with the steak and vegetables and lightly fold in so everything is mixed through.
5. Bring to a medium boil and then reduce to low and cook covered on the stove for 2 hours until the meat falls apart. Just low and slow is the only way for this to turn out right.
6. Potatoes  --  As the steak is cooking it is "spud" time.  In a medium pot of salted water add the potatoes and cook on medium high until soft.  Once soft drain well and return back to the pan to lightly dry out.
7. Mash the spuds with a potato masher (personally I like mine a rough mash vs a creamy type with a mixer). And for the cream or milk I like to heat mine up just a bit in the microwave 20-30 seconds just so it isn't ice cold. It just makes for a smoother sauce. Then add it to the potatoes along with the horseradish sour cream salt and pepper and combine.
8. Enjoy! Serve the swiss steak and vegetable sauce over the horseradish creamy potatoes.,

instructions, 1. Set oven to BROIL. (If you have a choice between HI or LOW use your own judgement. All that matters is that it is on BROIL.).
2. Place Bread on 'preparation area'. (I recommend using a piece of aluminum foil as it will serve a purpose later on.).
3. Apply mustard to one side of bread. Use as much or as little as you like. I tend use enough to 'lightly' cover the 'top-side' of the bread slice.
4. Lay cooked strips of bacon on mustard side of bread. (If you desire you could even crumble the bacon).
5. Lay tomato slice(s) in center of bread slice.
6. Lay Swiss cheese slice(s) on top of the tomato slice(s).
7. Place on a piece of aluminum foil if not already done so as your 'prep surface' and place on a cookie sheet broiler pan or straight on oven rack.
8. BROIL until Swiss cheese melts to your desire. I let it go until it starts to brown and  'crisps' but try not to burn the cheese though as it does not make for a good taste (at least not for me but again your preference here lol).
9. Remove 'sandwich' from the oven and allow to cool if too hot for you to eat right away. Elsewise plate serve eat and enjoy!
10. (OPTIONAL)- Note that lightly toasting the bread first and then following the above steps will help to keep the bread from becoming too soggy from the combination of the mustard and the fresh tomato slice(s) when broiled.,

2. Stir just  until almonds become a bit brown.
3. Turn off heat stir in remaining ingredients.
4. Brown lamb and garlic in olive oil add rice and stir just until rice begins to  brown.
5. Turn off heat stir in remaining ingredients.
6. 3 cups canned tomato juice  Lemon wedges Have both the fillings prepared and ready to go.
7. In a 9X11" baking dish or large wide-bottomed stewing pot pour 3/4 cup  tomato juice or enough to cover the  bottom of the dish about 1/2" deep.
8. Rinse chard leaves and cut off any stem.
9. Stack chard leaves in a steamer basket or metal colander over a large kettle of  boiling water: cover.
10. Allow leaves to steam 3-4 minutes or until soft and  pliable but  still quite green.
11. After 2 minutes of steaming you can  use two  spatulas to turn the whole stack of leaves over to allow the "less cooked" ones  on the top to steam more thoroughly.
12. Remove chard leaves to a plate.  Separate  them and allow  them to cool so they will be easier to handle.  Flatten a chard  leaf on the working surface and place about 2 tablespoons of chosen filling  1/2 inch above the bottom stem end.
13. Fold each side over the filling then roll up  from the stem end "burrito style" ending with the top of the leaf folded over  the roll.
14. Place the dolmade "leaf-tip-side-down" in the tomato juice in the  prepared pan.
15. You should be able to see the roll but not any of the seam which should be underneath.
16. I differentiate the vegetarian and meat dolmades by  placing a sliver of carrot or red pepper on top of the vegetarian ones.
17. Repeat  with all of the remaining leaves.
18. If you tear a leaf and can't use it or have  extra filling left over you can sprinkle it into the tomato juice when you bake the dish and your sauce will be all the more delicious.
19. Pour remaining tomato  juice over the dolmades.
20. Two cooking methods: Bake in a moderate 350 degree oven for 35 minutes on the top shelf uncovered.
21. or Simmer in a large stew pot on top of the stove.  If you choose this method  weight the dolmades down by placing a plate on top of them and then putting  something  heavy (i.e. a heavy coffee mug or two) on top of the plate. Simmer at  low-medium heat on stove top for 20-25 minutes.
22. This method produces a more  compact dolmade that holds together better when you serve it.  Important:  When you take them from the oven or turn off the stove let them sit for at least 10 minutes before serving.
23. They are much less likely to fall apart this way.
24. Serve 4 dolmades per guest with lemon wedges to squeeze over.
25. They  are delicious cold or room temperature as well.
26. Suggested accompaniments:  Avegolemo soup tossed salad with black olives and feta cheese fresh steamed  artichokes garlic bread.,

2. Stir the flour into the Kirschwasser then add it slowly to the pot. Even if the cheese is clumping a bit this addition should help smooth it out. Add a little lemon juice (less than a tablespoon) and add pepper and freshly grated nutmeg to taste. Add more wine as necessary to thin the fondue until it coats a piece of bread but doesn’t take half the pot with it.
3. Take the fondue pot to the table and place in on its stand with a lighted Sterno can under it.
4. Eat the fondue by stabbing the bread cubes or vegetables with a fondue fork (a long handled 2-prong skinny fork with barbs so the bread doesn’t fall into the pot). Dip the bread into the cheese and swirl a bit to coat. Let it cool a few seconds before eating.,

2. Heat a pan until very hot add about 2 tbsp olive oil season both sides of salmon with Cajun seasoning and then cook the salmon chunks on first side until browned and cooked half through.  It's easy to tell when half-done because the flesh becomes pale as it cooks through.  When flesh is lightened half-through flip and cook another few minutes until just browned on the other side.  A really hot pan is needed for this.  I prefer my salmon cooked medium and still a little pink in the middle.  Remove salmon and if you want cooked through more place in oven at 350F until cooked through.
3. In a separate pan heat oil in pan and cook fennel and swiss chard.
4. In fish pan add garlic tomato paste and a little water to thin out for sauce.  Add vegetables back in and cook through.  Add pasta to finish cooking taste and season with more salt and pepper if necessary.

name, Swiss Fondue With 4 Cheeses - an Authentic Recipe, 
cuisine, European >> Deutschland >> Swiss, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Cut off all rinds from each cheese.
2. Cut all of the cheeses into cubes.
3. Place cubes in a medium pot (preferably ceramic like Le Creuset) and put on the stovetop just below medium heat.
4. Pour the white wine over the cheese in the pot.
5. Crush the 4 cloves of garlic into the pot.
6. Stir the pot turning up the heat SLIGHTLY if necessary to melt.  Remember that the cheese takes a while to melt and if you turn up the heat too high in a fit of impatience then you will scorch the bottom of the cheese and have black chunks floating around in it --  so be patient and keep stirring and folding so it does not burn the bottom!
7. Fold the cheese as it progressively melts so that the cubes on top can contact the heated bottom.
8. Once the cheese has fully melted assess the consistency to determine whether to raise the heat.  If the cheese has fully melted but is VERY thick and hard to stir turn up the heat a bit (constantly stirring and folding) to melt it further.  It should be creamy but not stiff.
9. Meanwhile in a small bowl mix the Kirschwasser and the cornstarch together until smooth.
10. When the cheese has reached the fully melted ideal and it is easy to stir add the Kirschwasser and cornstarch mixture and mix it in well.  The cornstarch thickens the cheese and helps it all to coagulate so you don't have the cheese oils sitting in pools on top of the cheese.
11. Stir in the nutmeg.
12. The fondue should be well blended creamy and thick but not stiff.  Test by dipping a cube of bread --  If the cheese does not stick or soak into the bread then you may need to turn the heat up being careful not to burn the bottom.
13. On the otherhand if it is too thin be careful not to add too much cornstarch or else you will get stuck with a stiff fondue that is hard to dip into.  Try lowering the heat or adding slightly more cornstarch (mixed with Kirschwasser or water first).
14. When the ideal consistency is reached place the pot over the flame on the tabletop and serve.
15. Bon appetit!,

instructions, 1. Cut the bacon in small sticks thick as a matchstick and as wide as a cigarette is thick Fry the bacon with no added fat over medium-high heat until it becomes soft.  Reserve.
2. Wash the leek and finely chop it. Peel the onions and slice them thinly. Fry onions and leek in the bacon's remaining fat until they are soft and start turning brown.The author at FX says "I can't emphasize enough how important is this browning process. If you add every ingredient raw to the pie it will just boil and you'll miss half the flavor.".
3. Start by peeling the cooked potatoes and grate them coarsely. Salt.
4. Peel core and dice pears and apples. Save this for last lest they turn brown.
5. Dice the cheese heat the oven to 375 and prepare your ingredients around a large baking tray with parchment paper on it.
6. Spread the puff pastry onto a baking sheet. Spread the potatoes evenly on the pastry leaving a good 2.5/1'' space all around.
7. On this bed of potatoes lay the pear and apple cubes and cover them with the onion and leeks and then the bacon.
8. Finish with the diced cheese and sprinkle with crushed black pepper.
9. Cover with the second puff pastry sheet and carefully seal around the edges. Make a few holes on top with a fork to let the steam escape.
10. Beat the egg yolk or whole egg and paint the pie with a kitchen brush. This will turn it golden when it bakes.
11. Bake for 30 minutes in a hot oven (190°C) until golden.
12. Let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing with a long and very sharp serrated blade.,

instructions, 1. The loaf pans in Switzerland are 9-10cm in width and adaptable in length. For this recipe you need to adapt the length to 28-30cm. However I assume that this recipe will work equally well in a slightly different size of loaf pan.
2. Beat the butter.
3. Add some of the sugar then an egg. Mix until well incorporated. Carry on with the remaining sugar and eggs the same way. Always make sure that the ingredients are well incorporated.
4. Add the zest of the two lemons.
5. Mix flour baking powder and salt in a separate bowl. Then mix into the other ingredients. Don't use an electric mixer for this.
6. Generously butter your loaf pan (see point 1) and pour the batter into it.
7. Bake on the middle shelf of your oven at 180°C/355°F for 60-65 minutes.

instructions, 1. CAKE: Preheat the oven to 350°. Butter a 10-by-15-inch jelly roll pan and line it with parchment paper then butter the paper. In a medium bowl beat the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar and the vanilla until fluffy about 3 minutes. Scrape the mixture into the bowl and fold in the flour.
2. In a clean bowl using a clean whisk beat the egg whites with the salt at medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of granulated sugar and beat until the whites are glossy. Using a rubber spatula fold the whites into the yolk mixture until no streaks remain. Quickly fold in the melted butter. Spread the batter in the pan. Bake in the lower third of the oven for 20 minutes or until golden and puffy. Let cool in the pan on a rack.
3. Run the blade of a knife around the edge of the cake pan. Dust the cake with the confectioners' sugar and cover with a sheet of plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel. Top with a cutting board and holding both the board and pan invert the cake. Rap the board against the table then remove the pan and carefully peel off the paper.
4. FILLING: In a large bowl whip the cream with the granulated sugar vanilla and salt to stiff peaks. Using an offset metal spatula spread the raspberry jam on the cake. Spread the whipped cream evenly over the jam. Begin rolling up the cake from the long side as tightly as possible using the kitchen towel and plastic wrap to help shape the roll. Wrap the roll tightly in the plastic and transfer to a baking sheet. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.
5. CHOCOLATE GLAZE: Put the chocolate in a bowl. In a saucepan stir the cream milk and sugar over moderate heat just until the sugar is dissolved. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate; let stand until the chocolate is melted 3 minutes. Whisk until smooth then whisk in the butter and let cool slightly.
6. Discard the plastic wrap and transfer the cake to a rack. Pour half of the chocolate glaze all over the top and sides and spread it evenly with an offset spatula. Spread the remaining glaze all over the cake and refrigerate until set at least 2 hours. Garnish the top with raspberries. Transfer the cake to a platter cut into slices and serve.,

cuisine, European >> Deutschland >> Swiss, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Sift the flour and sugar together into a large mixing bowl. Coat the butter with flour from the bowl to make it easier to handle and grate it directly onto the flour using the coarse blade of a cheese grater. As you grate the butter mix the flakes together with the flour occasionally using your fingertips before grating more.
2. Add the sugar and lemon rind. Using two round-bladed knives cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles cornmeal.
3. Mix the egg lightly with a fork and pour over the flour mixture. Using the fork mix the egg into the flour mixture until well distributed. Then using your hand pull the dough gently together into a ball. Knead lightly and briefly on a floured board until the dough forms a cohesive mass. Pat into a flat round and wrap tightly in Saran wrap / plastic wrap / clingflim. Refrigerate for at least an hour before using.
4. Roll the dough out just thin enough to be about an inch and a half wider than the 10-12" tart pan and either fold it in two for the move into the pan or drape it over the rolling pin and move it that way. Carefully tuck the dough down so that it is flat both against the pan's bottom and the fluted sides. Press it gently against the fluting: then trim it off flat by rolling the rolling pin over the top edge. Prick the bottom of the crust-to-be with a fork.
5. Preheat the oven to  375°F.
6. Sprinkle the bottom of the pastry-lined pan/tin with the ground almonds. Combine the cinnamon sugar and lemon zest in a small bowl.
7. Peel core and quarter the apples. Slice them very thin (you may want to use a mandoline-type vegetable slicer for this) toss them together with the cinnamon-sugar-zest mixture and then arrange them in concentric circles on top of the ground almonds. Flake the butter on top.
8. Mix the cornstarch well with about three tablespoonsful of the cream: then add this to the rest of the custard ingredients and mix well.
9. Put the pastry in the oven and bake for fifteen minutes.
10. When this time has elapsed stir up the custard ingredients well one more time then pour enough custard into the pastry to fill it to the top.
11. Close the oven and bake for another 30 minutes. (If the pastry was showing too much browning at the 15-minute stage you might want to decrease the heat just a little.)
12. At the end of the 30 minutes wiggle the pan a little to make sure that the custard's set. If it is remove and allow to cool on a rack. If it isn't give it another five or ten minutes but no more. The custard usually puffs up while baking: when it collapses after you remove it from the oven don't worry -- it's supposed to do that.
13. The apfelwähe can be served hot warm or cold. Add whatever sides you prefer with an apple dessert -- pouring cream more custard a sharp cheese.,

2. Add the onions and bay leaf and cook slowly until the onions are light brown about 10 minutes. Then reduce the heat to low and cook stirring occasionally until the onions are soft and tender (caramelized) about 20 minutes. If the onions start to get too dark add 1/2 tablespoon of water. Remove them from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside leaving the oil in the pan.
3. Raise the heat to high and sprinkle a little salt on the oil. Add some of the squid making sure you don't overcrowd the pan--you need to leave plenty of space between them so the heat remains high and the squid is sauteed not boiled. Saute for 15 to 20 seconds on each side. Remove the squid from the pan and repeat the process with the remaining squid.
4. Return all the squid to the pan add the caramelized onions and stir together. Pour in the wine and boil for around 20 seconds. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve.,

instructions, 1. The food.com website won't let me list 1 package of yeast so make note here before you begin.
2. Add the sugar to the lukewarm water and then add yeast. Mix well in a 1 cup glas measuring cup and set aside.
3. While yeast rises put the milk and water (3 cups total) into a pan and scald it. (Look up how to scald milk on youtube -- ).
4. Cool the scalded milk mixture in the freezer until luke warm. When this is done the yeast will be ready as well.
5. Pre-heat the Oven to 450 degrees.
6. Combine yeast mixture flour and scalded milk into a dough mixer for about 10 minutes on low to medium speed until dough transforms into a ball and sticks to the hook. If your mixture is to wet after about 7 minutes add flour 1 table spoon at a time until it has become very cohesive.
7. Pull mixing hook out of bowl and cover with a towel for about 10 minutes.
8. Once risen put hook  back into bowl and turn on again on medium for another 10 minutes.
9. In a very large glass bowl pour water in about 1/3 full of hot water.
10. In a slightly smaller bowl that will fit inside the larger bowl grease this bowl put dough inches Flip the dough over so that the shortening gets onto both sides of the dough.
11. Cover with a slightly damp smooth cloth and let rise for about 1 hour.
12. On floured board take pieces of the dough about 1/3 cup for each roll. This recipe will make roughly 2 dozen rolls if mixed at the full capacity so you can also just lay out the dough and cut into 24 pieces then shape as described below.
13. Shape into round balls and then press the side of your hand down across the balls to make the split roll shape. Once you have created this impression pick up the dough bringing the sides together and place upside down onto a smooth cloth.
14. Let rolls rest for 5 minutes.
15. Place rolls on baking sheet with open side up and brush with milk.
16. Bake in preheated 450F oven for 16 minutes. Adjust up or down as appropriate for your oven. The rolls should have a very light brown look on top when done. (See picture).,

instructions, 1. Please note that the corn flour in this recipe is NOT cornstarch; you should be able to find corn flour at your grocery store in either the aisle where flour is sold or in the aisle where ethnic foods are sold.
2. In a large mixing bowl mix the cornmeal and salt together then add the boiling water and stir until smooth.
3. Let this cool until mixture is lukewarm (should take about 10 minutes).
4. Meanwhile in a measuring cup dissolve the sugar in 1/2 cup of the lukewarm water and sprinkle in the yeast; let stand for 10 minutes.
5. Now rapidly whisk the yeast mixture with a fork and then stir into the cornmeal mixture.
6. A bit at a time mix in the all-purpose flour stopping a few times to slowly add in the remaining 1/2 cup lukewarm water; blend this mixture well until completely combined.
7. Turn this mixture out onto a well-floured surface and knead until elastic and all ingredients are well blended; this will likely take about 10 minutes.
8. If you need to -- and only if you NEED to -- add a bit more flour; you will likely need to if your kitchen is at all humid as that can keep the dough a little sticky.
9. When smooth and elastic gather the dough into a ball.
10. Lightly grease a fairly large mixing bowl and put the dough into bowl turning dough so it is greased all over.
11. Cover bowl with a clean tea towel place in a draft-free area (try the top of your fridge or inside your oven -- not turned on of course) and let dough rise until doubled in bulk which should take about 90 minutes.
12. Now punch down the dough and shape it into either one round loaf or two small ones; have ready a well greased baking sheet or a well greased pie plate.
13. Roll the loaf (loaves) in corn flour until well covered then if you've made the two small loaves place on baking sheet or if you've prepared just the one large loaf place on pie plate.
14. Cover with clean tea towel and let rise in a draft-free place for 45 minutes or until doubled in size.
15. Sprinkle with additional corn flour just before baking.
16. Bake bread in preheated 450F oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped on bottom; they should be golden brown and crusty on top.
17. Transfer to wire racks and wait impatiently for them to cool.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. **24 Hours before you make the pasteis de nata remove tenderflake puff pastry from the freezer and let unthaw at room temperature.
3. Place all filling ingredients in a saucepan and whisk together until it is somewhat frothy in appearance. The temperature of the stove should be at medium heat. Stir constantly.
4. Bring liquid mixture to a slow boil.  Remove from heat when the mixture has thickened.
5. Let mixture cool completely before pouring into the tart shells.
6. The tenderflake puff pastry block will come in two blocks. (Cut each block into 12 if using large cups and 24 if using mini cups).
7. Dust knife with flour as needed when cutting to prevent sticking.
8. Roll each piece of dough in the palm of your hand like you would a meatball. Then flatten out by pressing your palms together.
9. Dust fingers with flour before working each piece in a rotating circular motion to expand to size. Spray muffin tin with non stick spray even if they are non stick !
10. Place dough in muffin tin and work in so that the dough is even with the top edge.
11. Fill each tin which is lined with dough with the filling so that filling is almost to the top.
12. For large cups bake for 35-45 minutes and for mini cups bake for 20-28 minutes. Until golden in colour or desired colour has been achieved (SOME PREFER TO HAVE THEM A DARK CARMEL COLOR ON TOP). I use a convection oven so adjust your heat and length of baking time accordingly.
13. ***When you remove the cups from the oven you will notice the filling to be quite puffed up but they will deflate once they start to cool.
14. Let baked cups cool completely then refrigerate in an airtight container.
15. These tasty morsels never last long enough to freeze so I am not sure if they keep well frozen.,

instructions, 1. Set a colander inside a large noncorrosive pan or dish with sides.  (You may also use a wooden produce crate with narrow spaces between the slats found at a local produce market as a colander; you would be half-way to Portugal in your mind at least.).
2. Pour a 1-inch layer of salt into the colander to form the base.  Some salt will seep out.).
3. Place a layer of peppers skin side up on the salt pressing the peppers into the salt.  UNCURL EVEN THE SMALLEST PART OF THE PEPPER otherwise mold will form.
4. Cover with a 1/2-inch layer of salt and the remaining peppers ending with another 1/2-inch layer of salt.  Place a heavy dish or bowl on top to weight it down.
5. Let stand for up to 5 days to allow the moisture to drain from the peppers.  After the fourth day the peppers should be thinner about 1/4-inch or less.  The salt will be damp and the amount of liquid draining will be barely a trickle.
6. Shake off the excess salt and process the peppers briefly with either a hand-cranked grinder food processor or blender.  The texture will not be smooth -- more like coarsely ground tomatoes.
7. Fill the sterilized jars leaving about an inch at the top.  Pour olive oil over the top to a depth of 1/2 inch.  Close the jar tightly and refrigerate.
8. To use massa de pimentão simply push aside the congealed olive oil with a spoon remove what you need replacing the oil and adding more if necessary.  Use sparingly.,

instructions, 1. Before beginning the meringue: Bring the 5-6 cups of water to a rolling boil.
2. Using the 2 cups of caramel sauce grease a tube pan.
3. To prepare the meringue: Beat the 12 egg whites on high until they start forming peaks.
4. Add the 12 tablespoons sugar and 4 tablespoons of caramel sauce to the egg whites and continue beating the mixture until they form very firm peaks.
5. (You will know that it is good enough when you turn your bowl upside down and the mixture is stiff enough not to move!) In an aluminum foil roaster (or any roaster you may have at home) place the boiling water covering the entire bottom.
6. Place the meringue into the caramel-greased tube pan.
7. Make sure that no air pockets form when placing the meringue in the pan.  Make sure it is well packed.
8. Place the tube pan inside the roaster over the boiling water and place it in your oven.
9. Bake 20-30 minutes at a low setting or until the top turns slightly brown.
10. Special Notes: Previously warming the oven may cause the meringue to brown quicker than it's cooking time.
11. Before removing the meringue from the pan pass a knife along the sides so it may unstick.  Because you are using caramel sauce for the meringue most of the times it is very stuck to the pan.  Unfortunately this is one of the trickiest parts of the recipe.  You may use a little butter to grease the pan before greasing with the caramel sauce but it doesn't turn out as good as using only the caramel sauce.
12. Enjoy!,

7. While they're baking prepare custard mix.
8. In a medium sized bowl mix together eggs sugar vanilla creme fraiche and zest from 1 orange.

10. Fill each shell almost to the top with custard mix.
11. Put custard-filled pastry shells back into 400°F oven on top shelf and bake for 8-10 minutes.

16. Continuously watching pot and stir occasionally to prevent burning sugar will melt and bubble as it cooks.
17. Caramel is ready once it turns a nice amber color and should be done around the same time the tarts are finished baking.
18. Move tarts onto wire rack to cool. Using a spoon drizzle caramel over top of each tart.,

instructions, 1. To Make the Pepper Paste: Combine the sweet paprika and the smoked paprika the wine garlic (to taste) crumbled bay leaves tomato paste lemon juice cilantro parsley salt white pepper and piri-piri sauce (to taste) in the bowl of food processor or blender; pulse until the garlic and herbs are minced stopping to scrape down any chunky bits from the sides of the bowl or jar.
2. With the motor running add the oil in a slow steady stream to form a homogenous dark-red paste; this should take 1 to 2 minutes. Use the mixture immediately or transfer it to a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate for up to 1 month.
3. Make the Tenderloin:Use a metal skewer to poke a center channel running the length of each tenderloin half. Widen the channel to about 1/2 inch in diameter then carefully stuff the cheese into the pork.
4. Place the stuffed tenderloin halves in a large (2-gallon) plastic food storage bag then use a wide knife to cover the meat with the red pepper paste. Carefully invert the bag holding the tenderloin halves in place then repeat to cover the rest of the meat using all of the paste. Season with the black pepper. Seal and refrigerate for 4 hours or up to overnight.
5. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and crank up the heat to 400 degrees. Remove the pork from the fridge and let it sit for 20 minutes. Have a large rimmed baking sheet ready preferably with an uncoated wire rack nested in it.
6. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tenderloin halves (with the paste on them) and sear for 6 to 8 minutes turning occasionally until well browned all around. The skillet will be used to make a sauce; drain off any fat and keep it on the stove top (off the heat).
7. Use tongs to transfer the tenderloin halves to the rack. Roast for about 20 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the meat (and not into the cheese) registers just under 150 degrees. Let them rest for 5 minutes before cutting. Some of the cheese may ooze out as the meat roasts; this is okay. Use a knife to gently push it back into its channel.
8. While the tenderloins are roasting place the skillet over high heat then add the white wine. Bring to a boil using a wooden spoon or spatula to dislodge any browned bits. Add the beef broth and return the mixture to a boil; cook for about 5 minutes or until the liquid has reduced to 1 cup. Remove from the heat.
9. To serve cut the pieces of each tenderloin half on the bias into 2 pieces. Lay one half in the center of each plate; if desired lean the other against it at a jaunty angle. Drizzle equal amounts of the sauce over each portion. Garnish with the parsley; serve warm.,

instructions, 1. Rinse the chicken and pat dry.  Place the chicken in a heavy bag and set in a large bowl.
2. In a small pot heat the olive oil over low heat.  Add the whole crushed garlic cloves to the oil and cook for 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let the oil stand until cool.
3. Remove the garlic from the cooled oil and discard.  Combine the oil paprika piri-piri sauce lemon juice garlic powder and the salt and pepper.  Pour over the chicken turning to coat then close bag and refrigerate overnight turning several times.  Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour prior to cooking.
4. Preheat the oven to 350°F  Remove the chicken from the marinade.  Lay the carrots in the roasting pan then place the chicken on top of the carrots.  Pour the marinade over the chicken then add the water to the pan.  Bake in the oven basting regularly for approximately 120 - 180 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 180°F (add a bit more water if sauce gets dry).  Add the potatoes to the roasting pan after the chicken has been in the oven for 1/2 an hour. Taste the potatoes for salt and adjust to suit your taste. I like my sauce nice and red so will usually add extra paprika while it's cooking.
5. Remove the chicken from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes.  Strain the marinade from the pan and serve with the chicken.
6. ***Alternatively the chicken can be placed on a rotisserie rod with a drip pan placed below and slightly in front of the bird to catch any drippings and prevent flare-ups as the bird rotates.  Add the remaining marinade and water to the drip pan.  Grill the chicken on a medium-high setting brushing often with the marinade.  Barbeque for approximately 120 minutes or until the meat thermometer registers 180°F  I have also cut up the chicken prior to marinating it then barbequed it low and slow on the grill -- delicious.***.,

instructions, 1. Heat the chicken stock in the small pot over low heat. Do not boil.
2. Heat olive oil and half of the butter over medium heat. Once the oil is heated add the leeks. Saute for three minutes until just starting to soften. Keep the leeks moving enough and the heat just barely low enough that they don't brown.
3. Add the mushrooms and a pinch of salt and cook until soft about 7 more minutes.
4. Stir in the rice and keep it moving in the pan. Watch for the rice kernal to change from fully opaque to translucent with an opaque center. Without this step the risotto won't become creamy as it should.
5. Deglaze your pan with a hit of sherry. I tend to be generous with the sherry but you just need enough to coat the bottom of the pan.
6. Once the sherry (or whatever) has almost fully evaporated add 1/4 - 1/3 cup of the hot chicken broth and stir to mix. Warm chicken broth is necessary to let the rice release its carbs out into the pan creating that creamy texture we all know and love. Risotto with cold or room temperature stock just doesn't work. Once the first batch of stock is almost fully absorbed add the second 1/3 cup. Keep repeating the cycle until the rice is firm to the tooth but pleasantly soft and creamy (about 20 minutes). The amount of stock used will vary just keep a good supply nice and hot in the small pot.
7. Once the rice is done add the remaining butter taragon parmesan salt and pepper. Serve immediately.,

7. Separate the dough into two pieces.
8. Flour your work surface  and start to roll out the dough rolling from the middle flipping it occasionally and flouring it as necessary to keep it from sticking. To keep the sheet from breaking once it has reached a certain size roll it up around the rolling pin and then invert the rolling pin; you can as you are unrolling the sheet gently stretch it by holding the unrolled part firm and pulling gently away with the rolling pin. Keep on flipping and rolling till you have a sheet that's almost transparent -- as thin as a dime or thinner (the pasta will almost double in thickness while cooking).

instructions, 1. Equipment needed: Potato Ricer Pasta Rolling machine Mixer stand or hand Baking dish Pot for potato boiling Pan for sauce.
2. Preheat oven to 350°F.
3. Filling:Put whole potatoes in water and boil until tender.
4. Drain and cut in half.
5. Put in ricer one at a time and squeeze through into mixing bowl.
6. Remove skin from ricer and finish the rest of the potatoes.
7. Add 1/4 stick of butter salt (1 teaspoon to start) and pepper (a few turns of the pepper mill to your liking) add reserved bacon and 1/4 cup sour cream.
8. Mix until combined.
9. Add baking powder and 1/2 of the milk and mix for another minute adding more milk if needed to make the consistency to your liking.
10. They should be creamy but not soupy.
11. Pour into a baking dish and put in 350°F oven for about 20 minutes.
12. The baking powder will give the potato a fluffy texture and baking it again will help incorporate all the flavors.
13. Pasta: Using a stand mixer with a dough hook works best but if you do not have one of these make your pasta in a food processor or the old fashion way by hand.
14. I will use the stand mixer method for this recipe: place all ingredients for pasta in bowl and mix to incorporate stopping several times to scrape down bowl.  The hook will eventually make a ball out of the pasta.
15. Pull the pasta dough out of the bowl and knead it until it is incorporated well.
16. Cut into 4-6 pieces and wrap in plastic wrap tightly and put in the fridge to rest for about 20 minutes.
17. Put a 4-quart pan on the stove with water.
18. When water boils add pinch of salt (adding salt after boil prevents salt damage to bottom of pan).
19. Pull pasta from fridge and set the rollers on your pasta machine to widest setting and roll until you get nice pliable dough to work with then start to flatten the pasta into sheets.
20. Lay sheets on the work table and cut them into 4 inch square (or a 6x4 inch depending on the size you want).
21. When water is boiling put pasta in water cooking for about 4-5 minutes (fresh pasta cooks fast).
22. If you need to do this in batches use tongs to carefully pull out the pasta and set it in a colander rinsing with cold water to stop the cooking process.
23. Add a bit of olive oil after to prevent sticking.
24. Putting together the manicotti:
25. Take pasta squares to the work station and lay them out to prepare for filling.
26. Add enough potato to the pasta to make a nice roll with minimal overlap.
27. Place manicotti in baking dish carefully allowing space between them so they do not stick together.
28. Put in the 350°F oven for about 10 minutes (about the time it takes to make the sauce).
29. All things up to this point can be made ahead of time and frozen or put in the fridge ready to go.
30. Sauce: Heat cream slowly and add Gorgonzola to melt.
31. •Alternative: melt butter add flour and cook to a nut brown (roux) lower heat and add milk whisking the roux to make it smooth.
32. Allow the milk to come to temp slowly.
33. Add cheese.
34. Finish: remove manicotti from oven should be nice and tender not crispy.
35. Place a tablespoon of sauce on plate and place manicotti on sauce.
36. Add a ribbon of sauce over the top of the pasta along with chives and parm (optional).,

instructions, 1. Grate the zest off the lemons and set it aside. Juice the lemons - you need 3/4 cup lemon juice - and set that aside. Microwave each lemon for 10-15 seconds on high then roll it firmly against your cutting board before slicing in half; this will rupture the juice sacs and make it easier to collect the juice.
2. Heat 2 quarts of water in a saucepan; maintain at a simmer.
3. Melt the butter in a medium oven-safe saucepan over medium heat. Add the rice and stir for 2 minutes until the rice turns opaque. Add wine; it should immediately bubble up. Start a timer at 18 minutes at this point. Stir constantly until the wine is nearly absorbed/evaporated 1-2 minutes.
4. Add the lemon juice half the lemon zest the salt the white pepper and 1 cup of the simmering water. Stir well then allow to simmer until the liquid level is lower than the rice.
5. Add another 3/4 c simmering water; just enough to re-cover the rice. Simmer until the level is again below the level of the rice stirring occasionally. Continue this cycle until your timer beeps. At this point the rice should be al dente - tender but still slightly firm in the center.
6. Add the remaining lemon zest the cream and a splash more water if needed; it should be more creamy than starchy. Adjust salt and pepper to taste; if too lemony add more cream. Serve with grated cheese.,

instructions, 1. Put 30 g of the butter in a large pan and melt it (keep the remaining butter for later).
2. Add the finely chopped onion.
3. Sweat over a medium heat for about 2 minutes.
4. Add the bone marrow and continue cooking for another 3 minutes breaking it with the spoon while stirring.
5. Once the onion is soft add the rice and and stir until the rice is completely coated with the fat.
6. You can see that the rice will start to become translucent keep stirring and sweat the rice for a minute or two.
7. Then add the white wine keep stirring and let the wine evaporate (it will probably take a couple of minutes).
8. Now add the stock and turn the heat to medium/low the stock which is kept simmering in order to stay hot should be added at the rate of a couple of ladlefuls at a time and when this is absorbed add more stock.
9. Carry on in this way for about 15 minutes during this stage do not leave the pan alone and stir regularly (gently).
10. After 15 minutes you will probably need an extra 3 to 5 minutes to complete the final stage of cooking (this time depends on the type of rice you are using). From now on taste the rice every minute until the rice is cooked “al dente” (this means that the rice is tender outside but still slightly firm to the bite in the centre). At the same time the tasting will tell you if you need to adjust seasoning with salt. Regular but gentle stirring is required for the last minutes in order to avoid the risotto sticking to the bottom of the pan.
11. In these last minutes if the stock is completely absorbed you can gradually add a bit more (say a half ladle at a time) because at this final stage you do not want the risotto becoming too watery.
12. Now at about the 15th minute put the saffron powder into a glass.
13. Add half a ladle of stock and dissolve the saffron stirring with a small spoon and then add the saffron into the pan.
14. Stir until all the rice is uniformly coloured (golden yellow). Continue cooking and adding stock as required.
15. When the rice is perfectly cooked "al dente" add the Parmesan cheese and stir for few seconds until the Parmesan has melted.
16. Then put the cooker off add all the remaining butter (cut into pieces) and stir until completely melted.
17. Cover the pan with a lid for about 1 minute and allow the risotto to rest before serving it.
18. Risotto should be served "all'onda" (like a wave). This means that when you serve it onto the plate it should still flow a little.
19. Buon appetito!,

2. Saute the onions for a minute or two until limp and just going translucent around the edges. Increase the heat and dump in all the rice. Stir to coat the rice with the oil then continue stirring over medium-high heat for about two minutes until the rice is toasted but not browned.
3. Add the wine and stir until completely evaporated.
4. Add 1 cup of hot stock and stir well. Lower heat to medium and cook until the liquid is almost fully absorbed stirring frequently. Continue to add stock about 1/2 cup at a time. Continue to stir the rice very frequently as it cooks.
5. When about 3 cups of stock have been added taste the risotto. The core of the rice grains should be al dente - not crunchy but not mushy all the way through. If they're still a little too firm add more stock and keep stirring. Season to taste with salt.
6. When the rice is done remove from the heat and stir in the butter one piece at a time (add the next piece when one is fully melted) then the cheese and pepper. Serve immediately in warm bowls with more cheese on the side.,

6. This can be topped with Parmesan croutons or served with [bruschetta]. When in season optionally add fresh ripe tomato slices and use chopped fresh basil and oregano. Another nice addition is roasted red peppers. Or add 2" X 1/2" slices of salami mortadella or a sharp Italian cheese such as Asiago or Provolone. Or add a can of cannelloni beans (drained) or a can of Italian Tonno (tuna) packed in olive oil.
7. Note: When using anchovies adjust salt as anchovies can be very salty depending on how they're packed.,

instructions, 1. Place dried bread cubes in a bowl and cover with cold water for 1 hour.  Drain and squeeze the water out with your hands.
2. Place the bread into a bowl and add the remaining ingredients except the Olive Oil.
3. Mix everything together with your hands very well (my butcher grinds all the meat and pork fat together for me at time of purchase it definitely helps the mixing process).
4. Grind the mixture in a food processor with the Olive Oil if you have a good sized processor you should be able to do it in two batches use half the oil each time. Grind the mixture very fine it will take a few minutes; you may have to scrape the bowl down a time or two.
5. Return all to the bowl and mix again with your hands.
6. Form into meatballs just smaller than a golf ball.  The mixture will stick to your hands so keep some cold water handy to moisten your hands when this happens.
7. Place the meatballs on a lightly oiled pan and cooked for 25 minutes at 375°F An extra 5 - 10 minutes if you plan to eat them right away.
8. Use these meatballs for spaghetti & meatballs.  If you are using a homemade sauce place sauce and meatballs in a slow cooker for 4 hours or so. I like just throwing them in the oven topped with sauce and mozzarella cheese and cook them at 375F for 25 minutes.
9. I usually double up this recipe and freeze the meatballs for future meals.  They turn out just as good for the next meal.,

instructions, 1. Cook the cous cous according to the directions on the box.  Add about 2 teaspoons of olive oil to the water before you add the cous cous.  Once the water is boiled and you have added the cous cous turn off the heat and let the cous cous sit for 5 minutes then fluff it with a fork.
2. While the water is waiting to boil or while the cous cous is sitting toast the pine nuts in a dry pan over medium-high heat.  Watch the pine nuts carefully because they will burn easily.  This may take about 5-7 minutes but watch the pine nuts to make sure they do not get too brown.
3. Once the cous cous is ready and the pine nuts are toasted add both ingredients to a big mixing bowl.
4. Add the tomatoes and the beans and mix together.
5. Add the chopped chives and chopped basil and mix.
6. Add the olive oil salt and pepper.
7. At this point check the flavor and see if it needs more olive oil salt or pepper.  (Using extra virgin olive oil will add even more flavor but I used regular and it still came out great.).
8. Cover the bowl and chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes or until the cous cous is no longer hot and just warm/room temperature.
9. Serve alongside your favorite main dish.  Another great side dish to go along this dish is sauteed spinach or broccoli.

4. Break up the broccoli as it cooks so that the end result is a mushy slightly chunky green sauce.
5. You may need to add more water or oil to keep it at a 'wet' pourable consistency if the liquid evaporates too quickly. You basically want it to be the thickness of a tomato pasta sauce. Add salt to taste; I only add the salt at the end because if you do so earlier on the saltiness may become more intense when the mixture reduces.
6. Serve over cooked spaghetti. Sprinkle with parm if desired.,

3. Seeding Zucchini and Summer Squash:
4. Because the zucchini and summer squash are boiled in this recipe it's a good idea to seed them first. Otherwise the pulpy seeds get water-logged. To remove them cut the zucchini or squash into quarters lengthwise. Then simply cut off the seeds.,

instructions, 1. Working Ahead: The sauce can be made several hours ahead covered and set aside at room temperature. Reheat to bubbling before adding the pasta.
2. Making the Sauce: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
3. Use a wooden spatula to stir in about l/4 cup of the orange juice and the 2/3 cup of sugar.
4. Melt sugar in the butter over medium heat stirring in spoonfuls of orange juice frequently to keep the sauce from crystallizing (reserve about l/3 cup orange juice for finishing the sauce).
5. Once sugar is dissolved heat can be turned up to medium high or high.
6. Stir occasionally as the mixture bubbles and slowly turns amber.
7. When mixture becomes deep golden amber stir in the pepper and two-thirds of the orange zest. Cook only a second or two to protect rind from burning.
8. Then step back from the skillet and pour in the last 1/3 cup of orange juice at arm's length. It will bubble up and possibly spatter then it will thin the sauce to ideal consistency. Turn off the heat. If making ahead remove the pan from the heat cool and cover.
9. Cooking the Pasta: Have a large platter and dinner or dessert dishes warming in a low oven. If serving with the capon have it ready to serve.
10. Make sure pasta water is at a fierce boil. Drop in the pasta and cook until tender but still resistant to the bite.
11. Drain in a colander.

3. Set aside  the measuring cups (with the ingredients still in them).
4. Melt butter and set aside with a pastry brush in it.
5. Unroll 1 sleeve of defrosted phyllo dough on work space.
6. Grease a square baking pan with butter.
7. Now pick up a sheet of phyllo dough and put it into the bottom of the pan (some will lay over the edge of pan so just butter it and stuff the thing in the pan no big deal.).
8. Try to work fast because it's easy.
9. Use up 5 of the sheets this way.
10. Layer the next 5 sheets by sprinkling cinnamon sugar on top of the butter.
11. Put a sheet down and butter it.
12. Next put a sheet down and brush it with butter and while holding down the phyllo sheet spread all of the Nutella on the sheet (if the phyllo moves around and your getting uptight  soften it in the microwave).
13. Don't worry about getting it perfectly smooth and even.
14. Use the rest of the sheets by alternating buttered sugar cinnamon layers and buttered corn syrup drizzled layers.
15. When doing the corn syrup use the amount you think you would like (you might want less or more than the said amount).
16. Brush the top with butter and sprinkle cinnamon sugar and drizzle a tiny bit of corn syrup.
17. Cook in oven on the bottom rack (to be sure that the bottom layers get cooked) for about 9 minutes or until the top layer is nice and brown.
18. Cut and eat !
19. This dessert's quality is compromised after a couple hours so you really shouldn't plan on storing it.,

Divide the batter among the 3 prepared cake pans and bake for about 25 minutes or until golden brown and a tester comes out clean when inserted into the middle of each cake. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to finish cooling. When the cakes are completely cool stack the layers with the frosting and frost the sides and top.
4. While the cake is baking prepare the frosting. In a large bowl combine the cream cheese butter and vanilla and using an electric mixer beat until smooth and creamy. Add the sifted powdered sugar and mix until thoroughly combined. Add the nuts and fold together. Keep refrigerated until you are ready to frost the cake.,

2. Arrange the peach slices in an 8x8-inch pan or a gratin dish. (NOTE: If you are using frozen peaches you don't need to defrost them first but you do need to separate them.) Sprinkle with lemon zest lemon juice and Amaretto if desired.
3. Place the amaretti in a food processor and grind into crumbs with a few short bursts. Add the almonds during the last burst or two so they get broken up but not finely ground. Stir in the optional sugar if desired. (If you are in need of a little exercise you can bypass the food processor. Put the cookies in a plastic bag and whack them mercilessly with a rolling pin. Add the almonds and optional sugar and shake well.)(NOTE: I skip this step. Instead I just add the cookies to the butter mixture (the cookies will soften in the melted butter/liquids). Mix and crush with a wooden spoon).
4. Transfer the cookie mixture to a bowl pour in the melted butter and mix with a fork until well combined. Sprinkle the topping over the peaches patting it into place.

10. Keeping the dough and work surface well floured pass the dough through the widest setting of a pasta machine 3 or 4 times.
11. Then pass through successively narrower settings until the dough is almost thin enough to see through; These can also be rolled by hand- they will not be as thin but they will be just as good.
12. Cut the dough into long strips 3 inches wide then cut the strips on the diagonal into pieces about 3 inches long.
13. If the dough tears cut it off and work it back into the dough.

16. Fry in batches turning once until puffed and golden brown about 1 minute.
17. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.
18. While the cookies are still hot dust them well with powdered sugar.

20. Dust well a second time until the cookies are quite white.
21. The cookies will keep for a week or so in an airtight container.
22. You may need to re-dust them with sugar before serving.,

instructions, 1. Combine the sugar and marsala in a medium saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Continue to boil swirling the pan occasionally to encourage even heating until a candy thermometer registers 250F/120C or a drop forms a firm ball in a cup of cold water - about 5-7 minutes.

While the syrup is cooking put the egg yolks in the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large bowl if you're using an electric mixer) and beat at high speed for about 5 minutes until they triple in volume and fall in a thick ribbon when the beaters are lifted. As soon as the sugar syrup has reached the correct temperature take it off the heat and immediately begin to drizzle it in a thin steady stream down the inside of the bowl with the egg yolks beating constantly. Beat until all the syrup has been incorporated and then continue beating for another 3-4 minutes until the mixture is just warm to the touch. Let cool completely.
3. In another bowl beat together the mascarpone and crème fraîche until smooth. Beat in the cooled egg and sugar mixture and then fold in the whipped cream and vanilla. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge to chill for 1-2 hours.

2. Heat the cream in a pot with the basil. Stir regularly especially as it gets warmer to avoid forming a skin on top. When it is simmering but before it begins to boil remove from heat and add the vanilla extract.
3. In a small bowl with a fork cream the egg yolks and sugar until smooth. Try not to incorporate much air into the mixture.
4. Place the 1 tbsp lemon curd in the bottom of each of four ramekins and spread evenly.
5. SLOWLY drizzle cream into eggs continuing to beat with the fork. If you pour too quickly the hot cream will cook the egg. Again try not to incorporate any air as you mix.
6. Split the raw custard evenly between the ramekins. Place into a baking pan. Pour water into the pan (making sure not to splash any water into the ramekins) until the water goes halfway up each ramekin.
7. Carefully transfer to the oven and bake about 30 minutes. Actual time will depend on the shape of the ramekin. Custard is done when it is set but still a little jiggly.
8. Remove from oven and allow to cool to room temperature. Then cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge. Chill at least a couple hours. You can keep this in the fridge several days if you like.
9. Just before serving sprinkle with a couple teaspoons of sugar. Use a kitchen torch to melt and caramelize the sugar. If you don't have a kitchen torch you can use the broiler in your oven but be careful the sugar burns easily!,

instructions, 1. Three or more days in advance of making the cannoli shells set the ricotta in a colander inside of a large bowl.
2. Scrape the ricotta into the colander and cover with plastic wrap.
3. Let the ricotta drain in the refrigerator for two days until it is dry.
4. To make the dough for cannoli shells:  In a small bowl put eggs.
5. Beat eggs; add vanilla and ice water to eggs.
6. In a large bowl use your hands to combine the flour sugar salt cocoa and cinnamon.
7. Add the shortening and mix until crumbly.
8. Make well in dry mixture and add wet mixture.
9. Using your hands mix together if it is dry add more ice water.
10. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and well blended about 3 minutes.
11. Shape the dough into a flattened ball.
12. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for at least 30 to 60 minutes.
13. Cut the dough into 4 pieces.
14. Starting at the middle setting run one of the pieces of dough through the rollers of a pasta machine or the dough can be rolled on a board with a rolling pin.
15. Lightly dust the dough with flour as needed to keep the pieces from sticking.
16. Continue to pass the dough through the machine until you reach the last or second to last setting.
17. You might need to run the dough through the pasta machine three times.
18. The dough needs to be thin-about the same thickness as construction paper;  cut the dough into 4 1/2 inch circles.  (Giovanna’s cannoli tubes are 6 inches long and 1 inch in diameter.).
19. Continue rolling out the remaining dough.
20. If you do not have enough cannoli tubes for all of the dough lay the pieces of dough on sheets of plastic wrap and keep them covered until you are ready to use them.
21. Put a rack in the bottom of a large heavy kettle that you plan on putting your peanut oil into so that your cannoli shells do not touch the bottom and burn.  (Giovanna uses a restaurant kettle that is about 18 inches in diameter.).
22. Pour about 2 inches of oil in a smaller kettle.  Giovanna used 4 quarts but her kettle is huge!
23. Heat oil until a deep frying thermometer shows 375 degrees.
24. Oil the cannoli tubes by placing them in the hot oil then draining them in a metal bowl (you need the oil on the tube so that later the cannoli shell will slip off easily).
25. Lay the dough circle flat center the tube on it bring left edge onto tube dab it with egg white bring up right side of dough circle dab it with egg white and roll the tube;  do not press the dough.  You do not want the dough to be too tight on the tube or you will have difficulty later getting your cannoli off.  Be careful not to stretch the dough or pull it tightly.   Avoid as best as possible getting egg white on the tube or the cannoli will stick to it.
26. Repeat with the remaining dough.
27. Carefully lower a few of the cannoli tubes into the hot oil.  Do not crowd the pan.
28. Fry the shells until golden about 2 minutes turning them so that they brown evenly.
29. With tongs remove the cannoli tubes holding them straight up so that the oil flows back into the pan.
30. Then drain the cannoli still on tube briefly in a metal bowl.
31. While the cannoli shells are still hot carefully slide the shells off the tubes by grasping each tube with a clean towel and gently twisting the cannoli shell off the tube with your other hand protected by an oven mitt or towel.  On another work surface area lay oilcloth or newspaper topped with a large rack.
32. When the cannoli shells are barely warm set them on top of the rack.
33. It is important that the shells stay on the racks overnight.
34. Repeat with the remaining dough.
35. If you are reusing the cannoli tubes let them cool before wrapping them in the dough;  set aside.
36. The cannoli shells can be made up to 2 months before serving if you drain them properly overnight and store them in sealed containers in a cool dry place but not in a refrigerator.
37. To make the ricotta cream put the thoroughly dry ricotta in a large mixing bowl with a wire whip and blend until creamy.
38. Add the confectioners’ sugar granulated sugar vanilla and cinnamon oil;  blend until smooth.
39. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the chocolate pieces.  Store the ricotta cream in the refrigerator for 48 hours.  After 48 hours serve and freeze the rest.
40. Frozen ricotta cream can be defrosted in the refrigerator later.
41. To assemble use a knife to push the ricotta cream into the cannoli shell.
42. Place the cannoli on a serving platter and sprinkle with confectioners’ sugar.
43. Use within an hour.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350°F and prepare a baking pan 13-15 inches long with either cooking spray and foil or parchment.
2. Combine honey and water stirring to form a solution; stir in almond extract and/or vanilla if desired and set aside.
3. Combine the dry ingredients (including the ground and the whole almonds) and stir for a minute or so to combine.
4. Add honey-water and stir until all the ingredients are incorporated into a thick dough.
5. Divide the dough in half and form or roll into 2 logs about 12 inches long (they'll spread out as they bake so place well apart from each other in the pan)--Tip: Lightly moisten your fingers with water to prevent the dough from sticking to them.  It's easier to shape the logs.
6. Bake at 350°F for about 30 minutes; they should be well risen firm and a dark golden color.  It is important that the logs bake a half hour or very close to it.
7. After cooling for 5-10 minutes slice the logs diagonally at 1/2 inch intervals with a sharp knife.
8. Place the biscotti on their sides and bake about 15 minutes at 300°F until lightly colored and dry.
9. If they need to bake longer than 15 minutes turn them over to avoid over-browning the side on bottom.
10. Allow to cool in the pan and store in a tin or tightly closed container.
11. (Note:  I usually buy raw almonds and roast them myself in a 300°F oven for 15-20 minutes stirring after the first 10 minutes.  Cool to room temperature before using in a recipe).,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Grease an 8-x-2-inch round pan and set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer sift together the flour sugar baking soda and salt. Set aside.
2. In a saucepan melt the butter. Remove the pan from the heat and add the coffee Chambord and cocoa stirring well to combine. Pour the butter mixture over the flour mixture. Add the cheese eggs and almond extract and beat the ingredients until the batter is smooth.
3. Pour the batter into the pan and bake it for 35 to 45 minutes or until a cake tester inserted into the middle comes out clean.
4. Let the cake cool in the pan then carefully unmold it onto a serving plate. Either serve the cake as is or sprinkled with confectioner's sugar or divide into two layers spread the raspberry preserves between the layers and top with a glossy chocolate ganache.
5. Chocolate Ganache:
6. Bring cream and butter to a simmer.
7. Pour over chocolate and stir/whisk until melted and smooth. Stir in espresso or strong coffee and a tablespoon or two of corn syrup (to boost glossiness!) if using.
8. Pour ganache over cake before it cools. (this recipe makes more than you'll likely need for one cake).
9. To me this is the perfect cake - dense yet moist - and needs no fancy embellishment. If wrapped well it will remain moist for a week. It also freezes beautifully for up to 3 months.,

instructions, 1. To make mousse:.
2. Combine the chocolate and cream in a heatproof bowl and place in the microwave and cook on high heat for 45 seconds.  Stir until chocolate is melted and the misture is smooth and shiny.
3. In a large mixing bowl beat the cream cheese mascarpone and chocolate mixture with an electric mixer at medium to medium-high speed untilsoft and creamy.  Pause occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
4. In anotehr bowl with clean beaters whip the egg yolks and sugar until frothy about 30 seconds on high.  With a rubber spatula or wooden spoon gently fold the egg mixture into the chocolate-cream mixture until blended.  Cover the mousse and refrigerate until ready to assemble the tiramisu.  (You should have about 2 cups mousse.  The mousse may be made ahead covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day.).
5. To make the zabaglione:.
6. Prepare an ice water bath.  Combine the yolks rum Marsala and 1/2 cup  sugar in the top of a double boiler.  Place over (nottouching) barely simmering water in the lower pan and whisk vigorously or beat with an electric mixer until the mixture begins to foam.  Whisk continuously until the mixture triples in volume and thickens to form soft mounds when the whisk is lifted about 7 minutes.  Immediately place the top of the double boiler in the ice water bath to stop the cooking.  Let cool sitrring occasionally.
7. In a small bowl beat the 1/2 cup heavy cream until it begins to foam. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons sagar and continue to beat until the cream holds soft peaks.  Fold whipped cream into the cooled zaboglione.  Cover and chill for several hours before assembling the tiramisu.  You should have about 2 cups.
8. To assemble the dessert:.
9. In a small bowl or pitcher add the sugar to the hot espresso.  Stir well to dissolve the sugar then add the dark rum.
10. Cut off the top of the cake and reserve for another use (see chefs note).  Cut the cake in half horizontally.  Arrage a layer of cake cut side up in the bottom of a deep 2 1/2 quart bowl.  Moisten evenly with some of the espresso syrup (can use a turkey baster).  Spread half of the mousse on top and then spread half of the zabaglione on top of the mousse.  Arrange the second layer of cake again cut side up on the mousse. Moisten well with syrup.  Spread the remaining mousse on top in an even layer followed by the remaining zabaglione.  Cover and refrigerate for several hours or overnight before serving.  With a vegetable peeler cut curls of chocolate to garnish the top or dust with cocoa.
11. Chefs Note:.
12. The shiny to of the cake will not readily absorb syrup.  If you do not cut it off you might find dry spots in your tiramisu.  But don't throw the top out!  Crumble it inot crumbs and place them in a 150 degree to 200 degree oven until thoroughly dry and crunchy.  Use to decorate the top of the tiramisu or save them to add to cookie batters or to scatter in pies and tarts to absorb juices.,

instructions, 1. You must repeat this 3 times. Once for each layer.
2. Sift flour salt and baking powder togerther and set aside.
3. Cream the butter and sugar in a stand mixer until the mix lightens in color and is fluffy about 3 minutes.
4. Add the eggs one at a time and beat about 1 minute for each egg add in the almond extract.
5. With the mixer on low add in the flour mixture and mix until just combined add whichever food coloring your using as it mixes.
6. Coat an 11x17 pan with non stick baking spray and pour mixture into pan. It will take some effort to spread evenly. TIP: If it does not spread evenly spread the mixture as evenly as you can. Then put in the hot oven for about 45 seconds. Then jiggle the pan gently to get the batter even.
7. Bake for 10 minutes at 350 or until done.
8. CAREFULLY flip the red layer onto wax paper and let cool. If you have more than one of these pans leave the red layer in the pan and repeat the above listed steps first with the yellow layer. While that layer is baking carefully spread the red layer evenly with the raspberry jam. Then CAREFULLY flip the yellow layer on top of the red layer you just coated with the raspberry jam. Now for the last layer the green one. Repeat the above listed baking steps and coat the yellow layer with the Other jar of jam. Once the green layer is done fip on top of the yellow layer you coated with the raspberry jam. You now have 5 layers. Hard parts over -- sort of. now you must weigh down the cookies. To do this cover the cookies with wax paper and take eithier another 11x17 pan or something of equal size like a cutting board and place on top of the cookies. You don't have to put very heavy weight on them anything handy that won't slip off. You're just trying to condense the layers a bit. Place in the fridge for 3 hours.
9. Remove the cookies from the fridge and remove the weight and wax paper.
10. Put the 1st bag of chocolate chips into a small sauce pan with the oil on a low light and melt until even. When done spread unto top of cookies. Let harden at room temp at least 3 hours. CAREFULLY flip the cookies and repeat on the other side with the other bag of chocolate chips. Let cool at room temperature.
11. When the chocolate rehardens Take a long carving knife and cut into small squares. Then put them in the fridge in an airtight container. Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Remove the zest of two or more of the lemons using a fine grater to get 2 tablespoons of zest. Squeeze out and strain the juice of these and the other lemons to get 3/4 cup of fresh lemon juice.
2. Pour just enough water in the double-boiler pan so the water level is right below the bottom of the mixing bowl when it is sitting in the pan. Separate the eggs putting yolks into the large bowl of the double boiler and the whites into another stainless-steel bowl for whipping by hand or with an electric mixer.
3. Zabaglione: Heat the water in the double boiler to a steady simmer. Off the heat beat the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of the sugar and 1/2 cup of the Limóncello until well blended. Set the bowl over the simmering water and whisk constantly frequently scraping the whisk around the sides and bottom of the bowl as the egg mixture expands and heats into a frothy sponge 5 minutes or longer. When the sponge has thickened enough to form a ribbon when it drops on the surface take the bowl off the double-boiler pan and let it cool.
4. Syrup: Meanwhile pour the remaining cup of Limóncello all of the lemon juice 1 cup water and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a saucepan. Bring to a boil stirring to dissolve the sugar and cook for 5 minutes evaporating the alcohol. Let the syrup cool completely.
5. Mascarpone: In another large bowl stir the mascarpone with a wooden spoon to soften it then drop in the grated lemon zest and beat until light and creamy. Whip the egg whites with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar by hand or by machine until it holds moderately firm peaks.
6. When the Zabaglione is cooled scrape about a third of it over the mascarpone and fold it in with a large rubber spatula. Fold in the rest of the zabaglione in two or three additions. Now fold in the whipped egg whites in several additions until the Limóncello-mascarpone cream is light and evenly blended.
7. Pour some of the cooled syrup no deeper than 1/4 inch into the shallow-rimmed pan to moisten the ladyfingers (savoiardi). One at a time roll a ladyfinger in the syrup and place it in the casserole or baking dish. Wet each cookie briefly—if it soaks up too much syrup it will fall apart. Arrange the moistened ladyfingers in neat tight rows filling the bottom of the pan completely. You should be able to fit about twenty ladyfingers in a single layer.
8. Scoop half of the limoncello-mascarpone cream onto the ladyfingers and smooth it to fill the pan and cover them. Dip and arrange a second layer of ladyfingers in the pan and cover it completely with the remainder of the cream.
9. Smooth the cream with the spatula and seal the tiramisù airtight in plastic wrap. Before serving refrigerate for 6 hours (or up to 2 days) or put it in the freezer for 2 hours. To serve cut portions of tiramisù in any size you like and life each out of the pan and onto dessert plates.,

instructions, 1. Break up all the cookies in a 6.75 oz. package of "Bordeaux" cookies.  Then use a sieve or sifter to separate the pieces so that you end up with roughly 2/3 COARSE pieces (size of a dime) and 1/3 FINE pieces (like graham cracker crumbs).
2. Set coarse and fine crumbs aside in separate piles.
3. Prepare semifreddo:  in a mixing bowl cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy about 5 minutes stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape down sides.  Then on SLOW mixer speed add egg egg yolk and cocoa; blend gently.  Add lemon juice zest and liqueur.  By hand fold in the COARSE cookie pieces.
4. Prepare roll for freezing:  Spoon the gooey mixture onto a sheet of foil or plastic wrap.  Place in freezer and allow about 3 hours to firm up.  HINT - a simpler method is to pack the gooey mixture into a bread pan (lined with plastic wrap).  Note that you have not used the FINE cookie crumbs yet.
5. Once frozen unroll and coat the exterior of the roll with the FINE cookie crumbs.  Return to freezer.
6. To serve place two slices frozen roll on a plate; garnish with whipped cream raspberries and a dusting of cocoa if desired.
7. Funny note - our Italian cooking hosts called this dessert "Frozen Salami Roll" because the finished slices vaguely look like a slice of salami.  We gently asked them if they would be offended if we NEVER referred to salami in the title and they agreed!,

instructions, 1. Remove both ends of the eggplant and slice it into ½ inch slices then slice these across and finely dice into ½ inch cubes. Some people prefer to season their eggplant with salt and let it sit for a while in a colander to draw out the bitterness but I don’t really do this unless I’m dealing with a seedy bitter eggplant. This dish is really best made using a firm silky one.
2. Now put a large saucepan on the heat and drizzle in 4 to 5 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. When it’s hot add the cubes of eggplant and as soon as they hit the pan stir them around with a spoon so they are delicately coated with the oil and not soaked on one side only. Cook for about 7 or 8 minutes on a medium heat. Then add the garlic and onion. When they have a little color add the canned tomatoes and the balsamic vinegar. Stir around and season carefully with salt and pepper. At this point if you wanted to give the dish a little heat you could add some chopped fresh or crumbled dried chilli but that’s up to you. Add the basil stalks and simmer the sauce nice and gently for around 15 minutes then add the cream.
3. While the sauce is simmering bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and add the pasta. Cook according to the package instructions until it is soft but still holding its shape then drain it saving a little of the cooking water. I like to put the pasta back into the pot it was cooked in with a tiny bit of the cooking water and a drizzle of olive oil and move it around so it becomes almost dressed with the water and oil.
4. At this point add the lovely tomato sauce to the pasta. By now the eggplant will have cooked into a creamy tomatoey pulp which is just yum yum yum! (Jamie’s words) Season carefully to taste with salt and pepper. Take the pan to the table tear up the mozzarella and the fresh basil and fold these in nicely for 30 seconds. Then very quickly serve into bowls. By the time your guests start to eat the mozzarella will have started to melt and will be stringy and gorgeous and really milky-tasting. Just lovely with the tomatoes and eggplant. Serve at the table with a block of Parmesan cheese and a grater so that everyone can help themselves.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Place almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast in the 350-degree oven for 10 minutes or until light golden and aromatic. Remove and set aside.
3. In a large bowl hand mix toasted almonds sugars cinnamon baking powder and flour.
4. In a small bowl whisk eggs. Add the vanilla and orange zest and whisk until well-blended. Add to the flour mixture.
5. Work the batter together with lightly floured hands. The mixture will be sticky but persevere. Keep squeezing the batter with your hands until a dough starts to form. Once the dough is firm form it into a ball. Divide the ball into four equal pieces.
6. Place one piece of dough on a lightly floured surface. Using your hands roll it into a log that is approximately 8 inches long 2 inches wide and 3/4 of an inch high. Repeat with remaining three pieces of dough. Place two logs on each baking sheet. Brush loaves all over with egg wash.
7. Bake for 40 minutes rotating pans midway through. The tops of the loaves will be shiny and deep golden. Cool on a rack for about 20 minutes.
8. Place a loaf on a cutting board and using a large serrated knife slice cookies 3/4 of an inch thick on the diagonal. If the cookie crumbles let it cool for a few more minutes. Don't let it rest too long however or it could become too hard to slice.
9. Place slices on their sides back on the baking sheets. Place in the still-warm oven with the temperature off and the door closed for 30 to 60 minutes. The longer they stay in the oven the harder they will become. Remove from oven and cool completely before storing in an air-tight container preferably a metal tin which helps keep them crisp. Stored properly biscotti will last up to a month.,

instructions, 1. Most of this recipe comes from the one on the side of the Belgioso mascarpone container ( the  brand at stores around here) but with some changes.  This recipe isn't an easy one - the most difficult part is properly saturating the ladyfingers without making them soggy - don't be upset if your first try doesn't come out so well.
2. In large bowl combine 3 egg yolks 1 tbs espresso sugar vanilla and marsala wine.  Beat ~3 minutes and finally add mascarpone and beat 3-5 minutes more.  Mixture should be slightly firm and very tasty :).  Add more sugar to suit your taste I prefer 1/3 cup some people like 1/2 cup.
3. In a separate bowl add whipping cream & a pinch of sugar whip until stiff peaks form.
4. Fold whipping cream into mascarpone mixture - should end up being fluffy but stiff.
5. Now you need to layer the ladyfingers & mascarpone in a pan - I use a 8x8 glass pan works perfect.
6. Here's the difficult part - your first layer should be ladyfingers soaked in espresso.  I say soaked but make sure they are not soggy.  To soak the ladyfingers I work with 1/2 a ladyfinger at a time dipping each side for a split second just enough to barely cover the top or bottom.  If you soak it too much just sqeeze the excess out like a sponge.  If you don't get enough use your fingers to drip some coffee on the ladyfinger and sort of massage it inches  Lay down 12 ladyfinger halves in the pan and spread a layer of mascarpone mixure on top.  Sprinkle cocoa on top of each layer.
7. Repeat for the next 3 layers.
8. Chill for at least 2 hours before serving.
9. Enjoy!,

I use 4 Tablespoons of freshly ground espresso beans to 6 oz. water and I usually have to make it in 2-3 batches because the basket in my machine won't hold enough of the grounds to make it all at once.  I suggest adding the grounds first then matching that amount with water.
8. Combine room temperature espresso with coffee liqueur and set aside.

13. Put the unsweetened cocoa powder in to a fine sieve or strainer and tap gently over the tiramisu covering it with a thin layer of cocoa powder.
14. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour overnight is preferred.

2. Place the eggs sugar and oil in the bowl of an stand mixer with the whisk attachment or place in a large mixing bowl and prepare a handheld electric mixer. Beat them together on medium speed for one minute until light and foamy.
3. In another large bowl whisk together 2 cups of the flour with the cornmeal salt baking powder and cinnamon until thoroughly blended. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat them together until a thick dough is formed. Use a spatula to fold the remaining 1/4 cup of flour into the dough by hand. Let the dough sit for five minutes so the flour can absorb the moisture from the eggs.
4. Meanwhile lightly grease a cookie sheet with non-stick vegetable spray line it with parchment paper and lightly grease the parchment (or simply place a Silpat liner on your cookie sheet no grease needed).
5. Flour your bench and your hands and divide the dough in half. Roll each half into a log about 1 1/2 inches wide. Place the logs on the prepared cookie sheet evenly spaced. The dough will be tacky but should be easy to manage; you can continue to shape the logs after placing them on the cookie sheet.
6. Use a pastry brush to remove any excess flour. If you want to add a bit more sweetness to the toasts brush them with the optional milk and sprinkle the optional sugar on top.
7. Bake the logs for 20 to 25 minutes or until they are puffy golden brown and firm to touch. Remove the cookie sheet from the oven and turn the temperature down to 300 degrees. Let the logs cool for 15 minutes on the tray.
8. Use a serrated knife to slice the logs on the bias about 1/2 inch thick. Lay the biscotti flat (on one of the cut sides) on the cookie sheet. Return the slices to the oven and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes or until the slices are browned and toasted. Allow the toasts to cool completely and store them in an air-tight container.,

instructions, 1. FOR THE VANILLA:  In a 1 1/2 or 2 quart enameled or stainless steel saucepan bring the light cream and the vanilla bean almost to a boil over low heat.  (If you are using vanilla extract DO NOT add it now.)  Meanwhile combine the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl.  Beat them with a whisk rotary or electric beater for 3 to 5 minutes or until they are pale yellow and thick enough to fall from the whisk or beater in a lazy ribbon.  Then discard the vanilla bean from the saucepan and pour the hot cream slowly into the beaten egg yolks beating gently and constantly.  Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over moderately low heat stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until it thickens to a custard that lightly coats the spoon.  Do not allow the mixture to boil or it will curdle.  Stir in the heavy cream and if you are using the vanilla extract instead of the vanilla bean add it now.  Strain the custard through a fine sieve into a mixing bowl and allow it to cool to room temperature.
2. Now pack a 2 quart ice cream freezer with layers of finely crushed or cracked ice and coarse rock salt in the proportions recommended by the freezer manufacturer.  Add cold water if the manufacturer advises it.  Then pour or ladle the cooled gelato into the ice cream can and cover it.  If you have a hand ice cream maker let it stand for 3 or 4 minutes before turning the handle.  It may take 15 minutes or more for the ice cream to freeze but do not stop turning at any time or the gelato may be lumpy.  When the handle can barely be moved the ice cream should be firm.  If you have an electric ice cream maker turn it on and let it churn for about 15 minutes or until the motor slows or actually stops.
3. To harden the gelato clean the ice cream from the sides down into the bottom of the can and cover it very securely.  Drain off any water that is in the bucket and repack it with ice and salt.  Let it stand for 2 or 3 hours.
4. PISTACHIO:  Heat the light cream and beat the egg yolks and sugar together.  Add the ground pistachio nuts and make the custard as above.  Then stir in the heavy cream and vegetable coloring and strain this mixture.  Add the chopped pistachio nuts and ground almonds.  Cool and freeze.
5. COFFEE:  Heat the light cream with the lemon peel and beat the egg yolks and sugar together.  Discard the peel and make the custard as described above.  Add the espresso coffee (instant or freshly brewed) and heavy cream; strain cool and freeze.
6. CHOCOLATE:  Heat the milk beat the egg yolks and sugar together and make the custard as described above.  Then stir in the heavy cream melted chocolate and vanilla extract.  Strain cool and freeze.  To Make 1 to 1 1/2 quarts of each flavor.

instructions, 1. Pat chicken dry. Mix flour salt and pepper on a plate. Dredge chicken in flour mixture to lightly coat it; shake off excess. Arrange it on a rack set over a pan for up to 1 hour (or refrigerate for several hours uncovered).
2. Cut or fold cheese slices and prosciutto so they will fit atop the chicken pieces. Finely grate 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest and then squeeze the juice from the lemon so you have 2 or 3 tablespoons. Have sage leaves and other ingredients near the stove.
3. Heat a very large (or 2 medium) nonstick skillet(s) over high heat. Reduce heat to medium; add oil and heat until hot but not smoking. Add chicken in a single uncrowded layer. Cook without turning until underside is golden about 2 minutes.
4. Flip chicken. Working quickly top each chicken piece with 2 small sage leaves then a slice of cheese and then a slice of prosciutto. Cook until bottom is golden about 1 minute. (This will depend on how long it takes to top the chicken with the sage cheese and prosciutto.) If desired use a wide spatula to carefully flip chicken again so prosciutto side is down and cook 30 seconds to warm the prosciutto and soften the cheese. Transfer chicken to a warm serving platter arranging the pieces prosciutto side up; tent loosely with foil.
5. Turn heat under pan to medium-high. Add wine; boil to reduce wine by half while scraping up all the browned bits. Stir in garlic lemon zest and juice. Whisk in butter until it’s almost melted. Add the sliced sage; remove from heat. Season with salt.,

instructions, 1. Fill a pot with water (about 1 litre). Add in 1 tablespoon of table salt to season the water. When the water is boiling add in the spaghetti. Stir the spaghetti occasionally to prevent them from sticking to each other.
2. When the spaghetti is cooking heat the olive oil in a frying pan over low heat. Add in the diced garlic and let them cook gently stirring frequently. When the garlic is turning a light golden brown push the garlic aside (away from the heat source) and add in the chili padi (if using) and prawns. Cook gently until the prawns are pink in colour on one side. Flip the prawns and continue cooking till pink throughout and thoroughly cooked. Take care not to let the garlic burn! Remove the frying pan from the heat.
3. By now the spaghetti should be al dente – do a taste test and see if it’s the consistency you like. Scoop out some pasta water and drain the pasta. Immediately add the pasta in to the frying pan with the garlic prawns and chili padi. Add in the chopped parsley and freshly ground black pepper. Toss the pasta and the other ingredients together adding a little pasta water if necessary to moisten the dish (you wouldn’t want to flood the pasta!) and taste to see if it needs additional seasoning. Scoop the pasta and the prawns into serving plates and serve immediately.
4. Notes:
5. To cook an aglio e olio prepare everything before starting to cook. The garlic requires a lot of attention so it may be difficult to multi-task while cooking the garlic.
6. A rule that I used when cooking pasta for aglio e olio: 1 litre of water to 1 tablespoon of table salt. This will salt the pasta well and most of the time I didn’t need to add additional salt to the overall dish. Do note that this rule applies only for aglio e olio dishes! Other pasta dishes I’ll only use 1/2 tablespoon of table salt.
7. I’m not a huge fan of chili so this dish is not very spicy (plus I always removed the chili seeds which is the main source of heat for chili). If you like the dish to be extra hot do use more chilli than specified.
8. The most important thing: trial and error! My pasta requires about 8-10 minutes to cook so I started to cook the garlic only after I added the pasta into the hot water. If your pasta requires a longer time to cook start cooking the garlic later and vice versa. If the garlic is already cooked but the pasta is not ready remove the frying pan from the heat and reheat the garlic gently when the pasta is almost cook.,

instructions, 1. Grind the pork shoulder.
2. Toast the fennel seeds in a dry pan over high heat constantly stiring the seeds to prevent burning.  When they are browned remove them from heat and grind to a course powder (best accomplished with a mortar and pestal).
3. Finely chop the garlic cloves.
4. Mix all ingredients together thoroughly.  It is often beneficial to run everything though the meat grinder again but not essential.
5. Note:  I recommend frying a small patty of the sausage mixture to taste the result to ensure it is properly seasoned to your personal taste.  You can also stuff the sausage in casings if you are so inclined.,

Scrape any excess ice cream off and put a cookie flat side down covering the bottom.  I have made these without the cookies several times and they still work great! You can even use sponge cake but I think the cookies are better for this dessert.
4. Put the bombs on the frozen cookie sheet as you make them being sure to keep them frozen.
5. When you are done assembling them freeze them solid overnight and then store them in a zip freezer bag.
6. The day you want to serve them:  Cover them with Magic Shell sprinkle some chopped pistachio nuts on top before the shell hardens working fast.  Pop them back into the freezer as you cover them and let them set up.
7. Melt the raspberry jam and strain out the seeds. Drizzle some jam onto your serving plates and then zig zag a squirt or two of chocolate syrup onto the plate to make a pretty design and sprinkle a teeny bit of pistacho nuts on the plate edge.

instructions, 1. Heat olive oil in a large 6qt heavy bottomed sauté pan (make sure you have a tight fitting lid for later or worst case scenario be prepared to later cover your pan tightly with foil) over medium-high heat.
2. Pat the meat dry with paper towels to remove any moisture. Season the meat with salt and ground pepper and brown both sides in your heated pan. When the meat hits the pan it should sizzle.  If it does not sizzle it means your pan is not hot enough. Alternatively if your pan is too hot the olive oil will start smoking and then well you can start a nice little kitchen fire. Just keep the pan on medium/high heat throw in one cube of beef as a test and if it makes a friendly but not aggressive sizzle add the rest of your beef.  The beef should fit in one layer with plenty of space in your pan.  Based on the size of your pan you may need to brown the meat in two sets. If your meat is over crowded it will steam and not brown which is no good for this sauce. (If you want to know why from a more authoritative scientific source than me go look up Harold McGee + Maillard Reaction.).
3. Once you have browned all of your beef remove and place in shallow bowl so as to collect accumulated juices.  Turn the heat slightly down to medium and add diced pork to the pan allowing it to render fat but not brown (about three minutes).
4. Add diced onion to pork coat in fat and cook until translucent but not brown (about three to five minutes depending on how finely you have diced your onion).  Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon to prevent browning.
5. Once the onion is translucent and NOT one moment before add the garlic.  If you add the garlic too soon it will quickly burn and ruin your entire sauce.  If there is one way to ruin a meal and simultaneously piss off the entire country of Italy it is too serve sauce with burnt garlic. Stir the garlic in the pork/onion mixture for about 60 seconds.  If the garlic is starting to turn golden add the wine like NOW!
6. Now that you have a mixture of fat onion and garlic in your skillet you have what is called a soffritto in Italian. Slowly add the wine to your soffritto.  Deglaze the pan by stirring with a wooden spoon to release all the brown bits that are probably sticking to it by now.  The wine should reduce by one half.
7. When your wine is finished reducing return the beef and its accumulated juices to the pan and add the whole tomatoes and their juices.
8. Add the oregano bay leaf (and if you have it the outer rind of parmesan cheese) stir the beef to coat with sauce mixture and bring to a boil.
9. Once you have brought your ragù to a boil lower the heat to a faint simmer cover and cook for three hours. Ever so occasionally stir the sauce with a wooden spoon and break down the whole tomatoes as you stir.  If you find that your ragù is drying out a bit you can add ½ cup of cold water and stir to incorporate. (NOTE: if you want to make this sauce in a slow cooker you can prepare through this step and then put in the slow cooker according to manufacturer instructions: generally on low setting for six hours and high setting for three hours. Don’t worry about stirring throughout braising process with this method but make sure to break up the tomatoes when the sauce is done slow cooking).
10. When your ragù has simmered for about three hours it’s time to bring your pasta water to a rolling boil. Add salt to the boiling pasta water.  For most Italians the rule of thumb is 1 liter of water for every 100 grams of pasta and add to that 10 grams of salt (known as the 1000/ 100/ 10 ratio of water/pasta/salt).  If you want to actually measure out your water salt and pasta go for it. I just bring a lot of water to boil add a generous amount of salt and test to see if the water tastes brackish.
11. Once the salted pasta water is boiling viciously add the penne stir with fork so they don’t stick together and cook to al dente (usually about ten minutes for penne and you can always taste the pasta if you are unsure). Do not be tempted to add olive oil to your boiling water.  It will create an oil slick that will prevent the ragù from adhering to the pasta.  You only add olive oil to fresh pasta which is more delicate and has a tendency to clump together without the aid of olive oil.
12. When penne is cooked to al dente drain it immediately and reserve about five tablespoons of pasta water.
13. Uncover your ragù remove the bay leaf/ parmesan rind. Now add the drained penne and the reserved pasta water immediately (do not allow the pasta to rest and thusly become flaccid in a colander).
14. Raise the heat to medium high and stir with a wooden spoon to coat penne with sauce.  If you are dexterous in the wrist instead of stirring the pasta to coat you can flip it in the pan (this is the preferred Neapolitan method).  Stir and cook for about one minute.  This step of mixing the pasta and ragù is critical as it coats the pasta with the sauce and creates a unified dish.
15. Plate your penne ragù (I prefer using a shallow bowl) add a few gratings of Parmesan to taste basil garnish and serve warm with bread.,

instructions, 1. Wash and core tomatoes. I also like to cut the little "nub" off of the bottom of the tomato. Just the nub and this will make it easier to remove the skins from the tomatoes.
2. Place whole tomatoes in a large pot and drizzle 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil over tomatoes. Place lid on pot and heat over medium.
3. After about 15 minutes give the tomatoes a stir (I use a fork to do this) ensuring not to break them up. This moves the ones on top to the bottom to help the skins to become loose and to prevent burning any skins. Cover and allow to cook for 15 more minutes.
4. After 15 minutes take a fork and fish out a tomato from the bottom. Keeping the tomato in the pot use two forks or a fork and wood spoon to start removing the skins. If you like you can take the tomato out and place on a plate or in a bowl to do this just make sure you keep the juices. If the tomatoes are not fully ready to be skinned put the lid back on and check every 5 minutes. (This is the most time consuming part but once you get the hang of it it becomes really simple.).
5. After all or most of the skins have been discarded lower the temperature to medium low and allow to simmer uncovered. This is simply stewed tomatoes at this point.
6. Once an hour check the sauce and stir thoroughly. Using a wooden spoon start to break up the tomatoes over the period of checking them. (Note: Don’t break them all the way up on the first second of even third time of checking them. Break them down over time).
7. After about 5 hours smash all tomatoes with whatever instrument you can find that will work. Add garlic cloves whole use more than 5 if you like I DO! (Do not mince/chop garlic) Allow to simmer for another hour. (Note: If you feel the sauce has reached your desired consistency or is nearing you can add the garlic earlier).
8. After 1 more hour the garlic should be soft enough to smash easily on the side of the pot and the garlic will literally disintegrate into the sauce. If sauce is at your desired consistency you can remove from the hot eye at this point and go to the next step if you like your sauce a little less runny or thicker leave on and continue to monitor to your liking.
9. Once the sauce is to your desired consistency remove from heat and add 1 cup of fresh basil leaves stir. Fresh is important to making really good sauce. Salt to taste. If you like a little spice add some crushed red pepper.,

instructions, 1. Brown ground turkey (or other meat) in a skillet over medium heat with a teaspoons of olive oil the onion and as much minced garlic as you like.  Add a good dusting of Italian seasoning and black pepper as you cook.
2. Drain the meat mixture then add the tomato sauce and season to taste with Italian seasoning additional oregano 1/2 C of parmesan cheese and black pepper.  Mix in the sugar as you do this to cut the "bite" of the tomato sauce--you won't taste it.
3. Heat sauce mixture just to bubbling over medium heat then set aside.
4. Fill a long casserole dish with cold water.
5. Bring a saucepan of water with a teaspoons of garlic salt and a dash of olive oil to a rolling boil then carefully add your noodles one at a time doing your best to keep them from sticking together while they boil   Boil until al dente still a bit firm--just shy of the cooking directions on the package I find.
6. As you remove each noodle place it in the casserole dish of cold water.  Remove each noodle from the cold water bath and set aside on a dish.
7. Preheat oven to 375 degrees and grease your casserole dish/lasagna pan.
8. In a medium-sized bowl mix the ricotta the eggs 2/3 of the parmesan and 1/2 of the mozarella--I find it is easiest to do this by hand.  Add a couple of teaspoons Italian seasoning just enough to be mixed throughout the resulting cheese paste.
9. Spread a thin layer of cheese paste on the bottom of the dish then add a layer of noodles followed by layers of meat sauce mozzarella noodles cheese paste and meat sauce (and so on repeating) in that order.  Finish with noodles on top spread with the last of the cheese paste then cover with the remaining mozzarella and parmesan on top of that.
10. Bake uncovered until lasagna is bubbling and the top has browned then remove from the oven and let sit for five minutes or so before cutting and serving.  Enjoy!,
