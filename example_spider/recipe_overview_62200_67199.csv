2. Step 2: Peel the ginger and garlic. Use the white part of spring onion and smash it. You slice the green part of spring onion small.
3. Step 3: Use 1 part of sliced ginger put into the bottom of pot. Crush the remaining sliced ginger with chili garlic and fried onion. (Mixture A).
4. Step 4: Put Catfish into pot add more olive oil mixture A smashed white spring onion 3 tea spoons fish sauces 2 table spoons brown sugar 1 tea spoon salt and a little chili powder. Embalm about 30 minutes and cook it with medium heat. When it boils you decrease to small heat. This process will make Catfish absorbs spices.
5. Step 5: Sometime you shake slightly the pot to help Catfish blend with spices. Do not close the lid when cooking. Most Vietnamese Fish recipes about Braised Fish require the same way is not close the lid. You cook about 30 – 40 minutes and then taste it again to suit with your flavor. Turn off the heat and add more sliced spring onion and pepper on the surface of this dish.

instructions, 1. Note - The ingredients above are directly from the recipe; however I didn't use the shallots when I made mine. I didn't have any.  I also didn't use the peanuts b/c I forgot.  But honestly I don't think you need them. Nor did I add the salt b/c fish sauce is pretty salty tasting.
2. Combine vegetable oil with honey fish sauce garlic shallots and pepper. Add the pork chops coat thoroughly in marinade and refrigerate over night or place in freezer bag and freeze.  (Mine marinaded more than one night once thawed - turned out great!).
3. Lightly season pork chops with salt (I did not do this step).  Brush grill with oil (I used indoor grill pan).  IMPORTANT - cook the pork over a very HIGH heat until nicely charred and just cooked through about 3 minutes per side.
4. Scatter the peanuts on top and serve right away.  (However I have refrigerated these and reheated the next night in microwave on 50% power and they turned out fine.).,

instructions, 1. Have the butcher cut the ribs across the bone in to 2 inch wide strips. Remove the membrane from the underside of the ribs and discard. Cut each two inch wide strip into three sections. Set aside.
2. Combine the chicken broth coconut milk and the fish sauce. Set aside.
3. In a small skillet heat the cloves peppercorns coriander seeds caraway seeds and cumin seeds over medium heat until the spices just begin to smoke (about 1 minute).
4. Using a spice grinder pulverize the spices and set aside. In a food processor add the garlic cloves shallot and chiles and pulse a few times. Add the basil cilantro and salt and pulse several more times. Add the ground spices and pulse several more times. Through the feed tube pour the vegetable oil with the machine on so that a paste can be formed. Place into a small bowl and set aside.
5. In a large dutch oven heat the 1/4 cup vegetable oil over medium-high heat. When the oil starts to smoke a little add the ribs and fry until they are lightly browned (about 5 minutes). Don't forget to have your kitchen fan turned on high. Remove the ribs and drain the cooking oil. Add the ribs back to the pot and pour in the curry paste. Stirfry the ribs and curry paste over medium heat for 30 seconds.
6. Add the coconut milk mixture and bring to a low boil. Cover and reduce heat to low/simmer. Cook the ribs until the meat is tender (about 1 hour). Stir the pot every 15 minutes.
7. Temporarily remove the ribs from the pot. Using paper towels remove the oil floating on the surface of the sauce and discard. Return the ribs to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes to heat them again. If you are not planning on serving the dish within the hour cool completely refrigerate covered for no more than 24 hours and then reheat when ready to serve.
8. Mix the cornstarch with equal amount of cold water until smooth. Stir into sauce until sauce is slightly thickened. You can keep the ribs warm for up to one hour on simmer/low heat before serving. Serve over cooked rice.,

2. Finely chop the carrot  or you can coarsely grate it on a grater.
3. Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil on medium/high heat on the stove in a large fry pan.
4. Saute the onions for a couple minutes.
5. Add the ground pork cook turning it over frequently for about 7-8 minutes until it looks white and no longer pink.
6. Sprinkle the pork and onion mixture with the salt pepper and sugar while it is cooking.
7. Add the carrots and continue turning over the mixture in the pan for a few minutes.
8. Push the mixture aside and scramble the eggs into the mixture as they cook.
9. When the egg is cooked and mixed into the meat onions carrot mixture remove from the heat.
10. Get another pan with 3-4 inch sides and fill with canola oil until it is approximately 2 inches deep.  Heat the oil on medium heat.
11. While the oil is heating up take out the tortillas.  Lay one out and spoon about 1/4 Cup of the meat mixture onto the lower part of the tortilla leaving about an inch on the bottom and the sides.  fold in the sides over the meat mixture and begin rolling the tortilla to resemble an egg roll or burrito.  Stick a toothpick in it to hold it together for frying. Repeat with remaining tortillas until you run out of the meat mixture.
12. Check to see if your oil is hot enough for frying by putting a small piece of tortilla into the oil.  If it quickly bubbles and turns golden-brown.  The oil is ready but you might have to turn down the temperature if the piece fried within seconds.
13. Carefully lay the tortillas into the oil.  Depending on the size of your pan you can fry about 4 at a time as long as there is room to turn them over.  You should turn them over every 30 seconds until all sides are golden-brown and crispy.
14. Remove them from the oil and drain on paper towels and they are ready to serve.

instructions, 1. Bring a quart of water to boil in a saucepan. Turn off heat and submerge vermicelli noodles in water. Soak for 3-5 minutes or until tender. Rinse with cold water in colander and drain.
2. Fill a pie pan or pot that is wider than 8" in diameter with hot water. Carefully remove one rice paper wrapper from the package and submerge it in this water. Let it soak until it's soft. For easier handling allow parts of the sheet to remain a little bit stiff (some of the hatch marks that are in the design of most rice papers can still be visible). Remove from water very carefully.
3. Place the rice paper wrapper on a smooth dry surface. Surface should be ceramic plastic or glass - Rice paper wrappers can stick to wooden surfaces. Take 1/5 of noodles and arrange lengthwise 1 inch from the bottom of wrapper. Leave 1-2 inches of the wrapper uncovered on the sides as well.
4. Add mint cilantro or basil lettuce and 1/5 of the flaked salmon as separate layers on top of the vermicelli. Pull the bottom edge of the wrapper up to cover the filling. Now fold both sides of the wrapper up to cover the edges. Continue rolling tucking the filling in towards you with your fingers and roll tightly so that the roll remains firm (but not so tightly that you rip the rice paper!).
5. Carefully move spring roll to cutting board and cut in half with a sharp serrated knife.
6. Repeat steps with the remainder of the ingredients until all the rolls are assembled. Serve with a sweet and spicy peanut dipping sauce.
7. A note about the rice paper sheets - As another RecipeZaar chef pointed out it's important to make sure to get rice spring roll papers. These are not the same as eggroll or wonton wrappers. You can find them in Asian markets or online.,

instructions, 1. Put all the sugar in a wok and add half the diluted fish sauce. Heat until sugar has disappeared into the sauce then add the rest of the fish sauce and continue over heat until a dark brown colour.
2. Add the pork chunks onion garlic chilli lime leaves pepper and lime juice. Cover and simmer on a low heat until pork has cooked (about 20 minutes) stirring occasionally.
3. You can serve this over rice but what I do is plunge rice noodles into boiling water when the pork goes into the wok leave them for 15 minutes before draining and adding to the wok with the pork for the final 5 minutes of cooking. This gets the noodles beautifully coated with the sauce.
4. Garnish dish with some chopped fresh cilantro and dried fried onions.,

instructions, 1. Process.
2. Step 1: Heat a large straight-sided skillet over medium heat and add sugar. Cook until the sugar starts to melt and turn brown about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook swirling the pan frequently until the caramel is bubbling and turns reddish brown 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and very carefully pour in water. Please be sure to turn your face aside while you do this so you do not get splattered. If the caramel hardens set the pan over medium-high heat. Stir until the caramel dissolves then pour it into a heatproof measuring cup or bowl.
3. Step 2: With hot water (so the leftover caramel bits do not seize up on the bottom of the pan) clean and dry the pan. Place the skillet over medium-high heat and heat canola oil in the skillet. Add onion and ginger. Cook for 1 minute. Add sliced garlic and cook for an additional minute. With a slotted spoon remove the onion ginger and garlic from the oil and reserve in a bowl. Many Vietnamese Chicken recipes usually require a short time to make this process.
4. Step 3: To the skillet add chicken thighs. Cook until the chicken no longer looks raw on the outside about 2 minutes per side. Yes the pan will be crowded! Add the reserved caramel sauce fish sauce 1/4 teaspoon salt black pepper and chili flakes. Mix to coat the chicken. Reduce the heat to medium and cook (the mixture will be simmering briskly) until the chicken is cooked through turning the chicken every 2 to 3 minutes about 20 minutes. Stir in the reserved onions ginger and garlic and cook for 2 to 3 additional minutes.
5. Step 4: Transfer the chicken and cooked aromatics (ginger etc) to a serving platter. Thinly slice spring onions and use to garnish the chicken.
6. To sum up this dish is one of best Vietnamese Chicken recipes in rainy days. With a hot bowl rice and soup you can feel comfortable and feel warmer inside by ginger. It also help you to prevent many sick when the weather changes. Good luck to you!

2. Preheat your oven to 375°F.
3. Spread them wings on a few rimmed baking sheets and roast for about 30 minutes until the wings are firm but not cooked all the way through. (Healthier Option: At this point if you don't want to fry the wings you can roast them for 1 hour longer until they're golden and crispy.) Wash out your bowl. Add the Sriracha butter cilantro lime zest and juice.
4. In a deep fryer or a very large saucepan heat the vegetable oil to 375°F.
5. Fry the wings in 4 or 5 batches until golden and crisp about 5 minutes per batch; drain shaking off the excess oil. If you like them crispy like we do I say give 'em about 7 minutes. As each batch is finished add the wings to the sauce and toss well. Transfer the wings to a platter leaving the sauce in the bowl for the remaining batches. Recipe recommends serve hot-but I say they would be just as lovely cold!,

2. In a large bowl combine the chopped onion sliced meat 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper 2 teaspoons of the fish sauce and the cornstarch; stir well to coat and set aside to marinate (the cornstarch tenderizes and makes the meat "velvety").
3. Over high temperature heat a large skillet or wok and - when the skillet is very hot - add the oil ("hot wok cold oil food won't stick"); add the marinated meat mixture and sauté until the meat is cooked about 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Remove cooked mixture from skillet and set aside.
5. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the pan and stir fry the minced garlic for 1 minute.
6. Add spinach leaves and stir fry for 3 minutes stirring constantly.
7. Add remaining 4 teaspoons fish sauce and tomato and stir fry 2 minutes.
8. Add the cooked meat mixture and remaining 1/2 teaspoon pepper to the skillet combine well and cook until heated through and sauce comes to desired consistency (the cornstarch will effect the consistency - you can add a bit of water broth or sherry if it becomes thicker than you'd like).
9. Serve immediately with hot cooked jasmine rice.
10. Note:  I've been told that "the recipe is not exactly Vietnamese since we actually use minced pork to stir fry water spinach; beef is always more expensive than pork at home - the good cuts are often on their own or cooked with minimal side ingredients; other cuts go into stews and soups" so feel free to try this with pork too!
11. Also when I first made this recipe I really wasn't expecting too much from it - it came out much tastier than I expected an absolute keeper (especially according to my husband)!,

instructions, 1. Using food processor process garlic until finely pureed. Combine pork garlic salt pepper and sugar in mixing bowl and mix well. In a separate bowl combine baking powder and water and stir. Mixture will bubble and foam. Add one drop of food coloring or caramel syrup (this adds color to the pork when grilled).
2. Fold the baking powder into mixture and allow meat to chill for about 30 minutes to 1 hour or longer. The baking powder forms air bubbles and adds more bouncier or spongier texture.
3. Refrigerate meat mixture a few hours to let it set for easier handling while forming patties balls or flattened mini sausages.  Keep a bowl of water handy and your hands wet for easy handling.
4. Grill or pan fry about 4-5 minutes per side.
5. Serve with Nuoc Cham and vermicelli (bean thread) if desired.

instructions, 1. Rinse chicken under cold running water drain and blot dry with paper towels; arrange breasts in a non-reactive baking dish large enough to hold them in one layer and set aside (I use a large heavy-duty ziploc bag to marinate them).
2. Combine the yogurt lemon juice garlic salt cinnamon pepper cardamom and cloves in a small bowl and whisk to blend; pour over chicken and spread over breasts to cover completely.
3. Cover and let marinate refrigerated 4-12 hours (the longer the better).
4. Preheat the grill using indirect heat. See note below.
5. When ready to cook oil the grill grate; remove the chicken from the marinade and arrange skin side down on the hotter section of the grill. Cook until the skin starts to brown (3-5 minutes). Move to the cooler section of the grill and continue grilling until the skin is thoroughly browned (5-7 more minutes). Watch carefully and use tongs to move pieces away from flare-ups.
6. Turn the breasts and move them back to the hotter section of the grill. Brown the second side well (3-5 minutes) then move them back to the cooler side of the grill to finish cooking. The juices will run clear when the meat is pierced.
7. Note: If you are using boneless skinless breasts cook on direct med-high heat 4-6 minutes per side.,

5. Roast in oven for 30-35 minutes or until vegetables start to turn color around edges and are cooked through.
6. Remove from oven.
7. Make tahini sauce:  In a small bowl place tahini lemon juice water garlic and sea salt to taste. (I use a motor and pestle to grind the garlic to a paste. Whisk until the sauce is the consistency of honey adding more water if necessary.  If you make the sauce while the vegetables are roasting and place it in the fridge until you are ready to serve it will most likely thicken and require a bit of water to thin.
8. Pour remaining 1 1/2 tsp oil into a small skillet or frying pan and place over low heat.  Add pine nuts and pinch sea salt and cook for approximately 2 minutes stirring often as the nuts will turn brown all of a sudden if you look away.  Remove from heat when they are a golden color. Transfer to a plate to cool slightly.
9. To serve spread the vegetables on a plate or platter and drizzle the tahini sauce over.  Sprinkle with the pine nuts followed by the homemade za’atar.,

instructions, 1. To make the yoghurt pour a gallon of milk in a pot with a very heavy bottom and put it on the fire until it starts to boil or even just foam heavily.
2. Stir occasionaly to prevent the milk from burning.
3. Turn off the heat and let the milk cool (stir to cool quicker) just until you can stick your pointer finger way down it without getting burned.
4. Take the active yoghurt culture and pour it down the side of the pan into the milk. I usually do this is a couple of different spots.
5. Cover the milk with a close fitting lid and wrap the pot well in a heavy blanket or two. You are holding in that heat and it will soon start to generate it's own heat which you are also conserving with the blanket.
6. Place it somewhere warm where it won't be disturbed for 24 hours. I have successfully made this after the yoghurt was let to develop from 24 - 36 hours.
7. If you'd rather merely wrap the pot in a bath-towel -wrap the lid too- and set it on a heating pad on low. I've started doing this and it works great too.
8. After you have yoghurt dump it into an inside out pillow case (lint will be in the inside corners) and suspend the pillow case up over a drain of some sort. I tie mine up to the safety bar on the wall over the bathtub (less traffic than the kitchen sink).
9. The yoghurt will begin to drain whey immediately I let mine go for 24-36 hours depending on how stiff or soft (w/ remaining liquid content) I want it. Usually 24 hours.
10. When it's as firm as you'd like turn the cheese into a mixing bowl and salt to taste. I use around 1 1/2 - 2 tablespoons salt. I know it's a lot. I think the salt was originally a preservative but that's the way I like it.
11. Elias' mum used to make balls of this cheese and store it in stoneware crocks covered in olive oil. I keep it in a mixing bowl in the fridge smoothed flat and covered in olive oil. It keeps a long time like that. If it's going to be eaten quickly doesn't need the oil for preserving just eating : ).
12. Enjoy this for a n Arabic breakfast with flat bread (pita) and olive oil. It is also good flavored with garlic dill or za'ater to your taste. Also pine nuts!,

2. Using a strong sharp knife halve the butternut lengthways. Scrape out and discard the seeds. Extend the cavity by cutting out chunks of squash. Don’t be too fussy about this because you want plenty of butternut to remain. Cut a light lattice all over the flesh to speed up cooking.
3. Use 1 tbsp olive oil to smear the surface lavishly. Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
4. Roast for 35-45 minutes or until the flesh is meltingly tender. (Check before end of cooking time as hopefully you have a ripe squash but if you don't it takes longer).

Add spinach and sauté with meat for a moment.  Once it’s all mixed well together add water to the pot  just enough to cover the spinach  Cover and let the spinach meat mixure boil and then turn it down to medium heat and let it simmer/boil for a good 30 minutes.   Meanwhile get a sauté pan and add some olive oil the garlic and the chopped cilantro and sauté’ that mixture together.   Add cilantro/garlic mixture to the spinach (after the spinach has cooked for 30 minutes).  Cover and let it simmer for about 15 more minutes.  Serve with rice and squeeze lemon juice on top!
2. • Using frozen chopped spinach works better than fresh spinach.  It does not turn out the same if you use fresh.  The frozen chopped is much better.  I have tried both.  Trust me!
3. • Be sure when adding water to the pot that you don’t add too much.  You want just enough to cover the spinach.  The spinach will release some water too!
4. • Squeezing the lemon on top of the spinach dish when it’s being served is the most important part of the dish!  Don’t forget to do that or you’ll miss out on the awesome taste of this dish!,

cuisine, Asian >> Middle Eastern >> Lebanese, 
time, ,

instructions, 1. Place ingredients in a blender blend till smooth & chill for several hrs b4 use to allow the full flavor to develop. Done!
2. *Note From Kay* ~ Some do not add egg whites & they pour the oil in slowly so it thickens. I have no patience for that. When I have tried it that way I could never get my garlic sauce thick. Adding the egg whites is technically cheating but it works every time. (Kay also said more garlic can be used to suit taste pref.).
3. *Note From Me* ~ Altho unable to find Mazola corn oil here I can happily report that I have now made a half recipe of this sauce using my immersion blender in a wide-mouth glass jar w/a lid so it could be capped chilled & stored. I used the *Euro Shopper* brand corn oil Kay's recipe (including the egg whites) + the thin stream addition of the oil method w/excellent results ~ a richly garlic-flavored & thick sauce. I did add some seasoning salt to better match the Icelandic garlic sauce that is sold commercially & very popular to serve w/lamb (& other meats).
4. *Note Re Serving Suggestions* ~ Serve chilled or at rm temp: 1) With grilled marinated or roasted meats (including chicken kebabs etc.) 2) With oven-roasted or baked potatoes or 3) As a dip for garlic-lovers but I would prob opt to add texture for this option w/some bell pepper red onion or others you might choose. :-).,

instructions, 1. Pick the beans clean from stones and grit and soak them in cold water overnight.
2. Drain and rinse them in a colander put into a large saucepan or a pressure cooker cover with plenty of cold water and boil them until they are cooked but still a little hard.
3. This type of bean cooks quickly so be aware until you get used to them.
4. They take hardly 2 minutes in a pressure cooker and about 30-40 minutes otherwise.
5. If they get overcooked they get mushy and soggy and they do not taste at their best.
6. This first step then is also the most important in this recipe.

instructions, 1. Brown meat in a large frying pan with some olive oil from the bottle. Add season salt if desired or use regular salt and pepper. Make sure all pieces of meat have been browned. Set aside.
2. In a stew pan over medium heat add the olive oil and the tomato paste. Fry the tomato paste about 5-8 minutes. If it seems dry add more oil in small amounts. It should be chunky in the oil not runny like soup. Stir constantly! This will burn very easily.
3. Turn down the heat add 2 cups of water. Stand back it may spit at you! Continue to add the water in 2-cup increments. Add the boullion cubes. Stir around and scrape the bottom of the pan to make sure all tomato paste is mixed in the water.
4. Add the lima beans and the meat. Bring to a boil (should take about 5 minutes) then reduce to a simmer. Add salt and pepper to taste. Depending on the quality of the meat it may take 2-4 hours for the meat to become tender.
5. Add more water if too much boils out or it is too salty.
6. Serve with Middle Eastern rice.
7. This can be prepared in a stainless steel or non-stick pan. I prefer non-stick. Additionally it may be transferred to a crock pot to simmer all day. Never leave food cooking on the stove unattended!,

cuisine, Asian >> Middle Eastern >> Lebanese, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. If using preserved grape leaves unpack from jar and rinse in a generous amount of cold water separating leave so excess brine leaches out.
2. If you actually have access to fresh grape leaves wash them thoroughly in cold water drop them a few at a time into boiling water for just a couple of seconds to soften and then transfer them into cold water to stop them from cooking.
3. Combine all the stuffing ingredients.
4. Don’t overwork the mixture just mix it enough to combine the ingredients without compacting everything too much.
5. Refrigerate for about an hour for flavors to meld.
6. Prepare a fairly large pot to cook the grape leaves.
7. Place the lamb or chicken bones in the bottom of the pot.
8. Cover with any torn grape leaves you may have or a couple cabbage or lettuce leaves and add just a little water.
9. To stuff the grape leaves place a leaf stem-side up on the counter with the stem end closest to you.
10. Put a heaping teaspoon of stuffing near the stem end fold the stem end over the filling fold the sides in and then roll toward the tip like a small cigar.
11. Squeeze lightly in the palm of your hand so everything sticks together.
12. Stuff the remaining leaves the same way.
13. Pack the stuffed grape leaves fairly densely into the prepared pot tucking the slivered garlic cloves here and there.
14. Drizzle each layer of grape leaves with a little with the lemon juice and sprinkle with a little dried mint.
15. Add just enough water to just barely cover the rolls.
16. Cover with more torn grape leaves cabbage leaves or lettuce leaves (in a pinch paper towels) and cover with a small plate to keep them submerged and to keep them from coming unrolling.
17. Bring them to a simmer over fairly low heat and simmer for about 1 hour adding more water as needed.
18. If desired about 20 minutes before they are done carefully remove the lid covering plate and leaves paper towels whatever and sprinkle with dried mint.
19. Add a little more water recover with everything and continue cooking.
20. These are best hot or warm.
21. They are only OK cold-- kind of boring-- just not enough flavor when cold.
22. Alternative: You can use this same filling to make Stuffed Cabbage Leaves (Mahshi Coromb).
23. I actually like these better than the stuffed grape leaves.
24. Everything is pretty much the same except for using cabbage instead of grape leaves plus a few other minor points.
25. Find a large head of cabbage that looks real pretty with nice large outside leaves.
26. Cut a deep cone to remove most of the core.
27. Fill a fairly large pan with water add several tablespoons of salt and bring to a full boil.
28. Plunge the entire head of cabbage into the water for 10-15 seconds remove peel off the outermost layer or layers of leaves and drop them into cold water.
29. Repeat until you have removed all of the larger leaves on the head of cabbage-- even fairly small leaves are OK.
30. You just end up with big cabbage rolls and small cabbage rolls.
31. Prepare your cooking pot the same way except use left over cabbage leaves (or slice up a little of the core) instead of grape leaves.
32. You will probably have to trim down the heavy main-veins on the cabbage leaves so they can be rolled easily.
33. Compare how many cabbage leaves you have their size and the amount of stuffing you have to determine just how much to put into each leaf.
34. Roll them up the same way as you would the grape leaves; they will just be a lot bigger.
35. Pack the cabbage rolls into the cooking pot add the garlic slivers as before sprinkle with the lemon juice and now you face the only possible change-- but that’s up to you.
36. Are you ready for one of the biggest decisions of your life?.
37. You must decide whether to add 3-4 Tbsp of tomato paste to the water you are going to add to the cabbage rolls.
38. Then you must decide whether you are going to add 1-2 Tbsp of honey or sugar to the same mess.
39. I have been told that the tomato and honey is a Greek influence on the basic Arabic cuisine but I don’t really know for sure.
40. I think the cabbage rolls are better WITH the tomato and honey.
41. It offsets the little bitterness of the cabbage but it is your choice.
42. Everything else is just the same even the touch of mint if you want to use it.
43. These are DEFINITELY best when served hot!,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.
2. Grind graham crackers in food processor until as fine as breadcrumbs.
3. Sift out about 1/3 cup of the finest and set them aside.
4. Place remainder in a medium bowl.
5. Spread walnuts and pistachios on a baking sheet and toast at 300 degrees F for about 15-20 minutes until quite fragrant but not smelling overcooked stirring every 5 minutes.
6. Allow nuts to cool completely place in food processor and pulse until most of the nuts are medium-fine but not too fine.
7. Transfer to bowl with graham cracker crumbs.
8. Add cinnamon cloves nutmeg and allspice.
9. and mix together until well combined.
10. Taste and add optional salt if desired.
11. Sprinkle with orange flower or rose water 1 Tbsp at a time stirring between additions until it tastes good to you.
12. Return mixture to baking sheet and place it in the oven.
13. Reduce heat to 225 degrees F and dry for about 20-30 minutes stirring every 10 minutes.
14. Mixture should still be slightly damp.
15. Remove from oven allow to cool and return to bowl.
16. While nuts cool start to make the syrup.
17. Combine all ingredients except orange flower or rose water in a saucepan and bring to a boil stirring to dissolve sugar.
18. Reduce the heat and let simmer for 10-20 minutes until thickened and temperature reads 220 degrees F on a candy thermometer.
19. Remove the orange peel cinnamon stick and whole cloves and set aside to cool.
20. When just warm add orange flower water or rose water to taste stir well and refrigerate.
21. Syrup must be no warmer than room temperature when poured over the baklava or it wont soak in well.
22. Brush a 13"x9"x2" baking pan with melted butter and set aside.
23. If using large sheets of phyllo cut a piece of cardboard into a 13"x9" rectangle.
24. Unroll the phyllo dough and lay the sheets flat on a work surface.
25. Set the cardboard template on the stack of phyllo and trim the excess so they fit the pan.
26. Keep the pastry covered with a damp not wet towel as you work to prevent drying out.
27. If using smaller 9"x14" sheets use as is.
28. In either case you should have 30-40 phyllo sheets available.
29. To build the baklava you will alternate 3 layers of dough with 2 layers of nuts.
30. If using 40 phyllo sheets use 15 each for the top and bottom layers and 10 sheets between the nut layers; use about the same proportions if using a different number of sheets.
31. This will make a nice almost 2" thick baklava but will still leave a little room in the pan for adding the syrup.
32. Start with a stable base of 15 sheets on the bottom brushing each with melted butter and sprinkling each with about 1/4 to 1/2 Tsp of the fine graham cracker crumbs just enough to help keep the sheets separated.
33. Squeeze out big air bubbles as you go but dont squeeze the layers together any more than necessary.
34. The purpose of the butter and crumbs is to keep the phyllo layers separated and the final product flaky.
35. Spread half of the nut mixture evenly over the stacked sheets and drizzle lightly with butter.
36. Cover with 10 sheets of phyllo painting each with melted butter and sprinkling with crumbs as before then top again with remaining nut mixture and drizzle lightly with butter.
37. Top the last layer of nuts with the remaining sheets of phyllo as you did for the bottom.
38. Drizzle or brush any remaining butter over top.
39. Depending on desired size cut the baklava lengthwise into 4-5 strips using a very sharp knife.
40. Be sure to cut all the way to the bottom of the stack.
41. Then make similar slices at a 45 degree angle to the first ones to get the classical diamond shaped pieces of baklava.
42. Again be sure to slice all the way to the bottom of the stack.
43. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and bake the baklava for 30 minutes in the middle of the oven rotating after 15 minutes.
44. Reduce heat to 300 degrees F rotate the pan again and bake for another 20-30 minutes rotating every 10 minutes until baklava is a nice light golden brown on top.
45. Remove baklava from oven and remove a corner piece of the baklava tilt the pan down toward that corner to allow the butter if any to collect in the corner.
46. Spoon out the butter (or suck it out with a turkey baster; much easier!) and discard.
47. With the pan again sitting flat ladle the cooled syrup evenly over the very hot baklava starting over all the cuts in the stack so the syrup soaks in.
48. Allow to stand until completely cooled to room temperature at least several hours before serving.
49. If desired remove excess syrup as you did with the butter.
50. You will have excess syrup but thats what makes this good!
51. But what makes it soggy after a couple of days!,

cuisine, Asian >> Middle Eastern >> Lebanese, 
time, ,

instructions, 1. Make syrup:
2. Place sugar water and flower water in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil stirring so that the syrup dissolves. Let boil until it is a slightly thick syrup then set aside and let cool completely.
3. Make filling:
4. Place homogenized milk sugar spices and sea salt in a sauce pan. Bring the mixture to a simmer stirring so that the sugar dissolves.
5. Add the semolina in a slow stream stirring to combine.
6. Simmer the mixture over low heat stirring constantly until the mixture is thickened and the semolina is soft about 10 minutes.
7. Set aside to cool completely before using.
8. Putting it all together:
9. Preheat the oven to 350°F
10. Have your melted butter and pastry brush ready. Get two cloths or dish towels moisten them then wring them out as much as possible. Unroll your phyllo on your work surface and cover it with plastic wrap then cover with the damp cloths.
11. Brush a 9X13 inch baking dish all over with some of the melted butter.
12. Brush one sheet of phyllo lightly with the butter then place in the baking dish letting any extra come up the sides. Repeat brushing a phyllo sheet with butter and layering it in the baking dish keeping the remaining phyllo covered until you’ve used half the phyllo.
13. Evenly put the filling into the dish on the phyllo that was last brushed with butter.
14. Continue brushing phyllo with butter then layering it on top of the filling allowing the edges of phyllo to hang over the sides of the pan. When you have layered all but 2 sheets of the phyllo take all the pieces of phyllo that are hanging over the sides and fold them back into the pan (some of the edges may be dry snap them off and discard them) Brush the fold overs with butter. Brush the final 2 sheets of phyllo with butter and place them over the pan tucking the edges down into the side of the pan. Brush the top with melted butter.
15. Score the top layer of the pie to form diamonds (it looks prettier than squares but do what you can) then run your knife through the scores again cutting all the way through to the bottom the pan. Place in the oven and bake until crisp and golden watch at 40 minutes.
16. Remove from the oven and immediately pour the cool syrup slowly over the baklava. Set aside to absorb for several hours before serving.
17. Helpful Tips:
18. When working with phyllo it’s important to work quickly to keep the dough from drying out. In order to do so make sure you have all your ingredients and tools ready and know what you are going to do. Read through the recipe several times to familiarize yourself with the process this will help prevent you from constantly stopping to check the recipe which will slow you down.
19. Never leave phyllo uncovered for more than a minute.
20. Brush each phyllo sheet lightly with butter beginning at the corners and working inward. You want to brush it with enough butter to prevent dryness but you don’t want to saturate it so that it’s heavy or soggy.
21. Make sure your syrup is cooled before you use it. Cool syrup + hot phyllo = crispy baklava.,

instructions, 1. In a food processor finely chop the garlic cloves. While processor is running through the lid gradually add 3 tablespoons of  the olive oil to the garlic and mix garlic into the oil. Stop food processor. Open lid and add the peanut butter. Close and start processor. Beat until peanut butter oil and garlic start to mix. While processor still running gradually add through the lid the lemon juice homogenizing it into the peanut butter mixture. Stop processor.
2. Open garbanzo beans. Drain liquid off the garbanzos but retain a few tablespoons of the liquid and set aside.
3. Open lid and add the garbanzos to the peanut butter mixture. Close processor lid and start processor.
4. Puree the garbanzos homogenizing them into the peanut butter mixture with the food processor running. Only if it is too thick add a tablespoon at a time some of the retained garbanzo liquid until the hummus is a smooth thick texture. You don’t want it too soupy.
5. As processor is still running add salt.
6. Stop processor and test the hummus for proper balance of lemon juice olive oil  garlic and salt. The tanginess should balance with the flavor of the peanut butter and garbanzo. Adjust to taste. One note: be careful with the lemon juice. It quickly overwhelms the other flavors if you're not careful.
7. To serve spread hummus into a shallow serving dish and pour remaining olive oil over the top and swirl it backward gently with a spoon to spread it over the surface of the hummus.
8. Garnish as desired. Traditionally in addition to the olive oil poured over the top of the finished hummus other garnishes are sometimes added over the top of oil. Example of some finishing garnishes are finely chopped parsley and/or paprika.
9. Also often for color and because they taste good with hummus tomato wedges are placed around the edge of the hummus inside the serving bowl (on top of hummus around rim of dish).

instructions, 1. First defrost the phyllo dough. Do this by shredding the phyllo in a bowl continuously till completely defrosted. While you are doing the shredding start adding the butter(this is done so the dough does not stick together).
2. When this process is complete and the dough is shredded thoroughly separate the dough into two equal portions.
3. In a well buttered 9x13-inch pan spread out the dough thoroughly but do not compress. Once the dough is spread evenly start preparing the Ricotta cheese. Make patties similar to hamburger patties but with the cheese.
4. Lay the cheese patties onto the prepared dough in the pan.
5. Once the layer of Ricotta cheese is completely covering the dough lay the second half of the dough unto the cheese so that it is evenly distributed.
6. Preheat the oven to 350°F Once preheated place the pan in the middle of the oven for about 45 minutes. What you need to look for is that the dough browns.
7. Once this occurs you will need a larger pan in which you will flip the Knafe so the the bottom is on top.
8. Then bake again till the browning occurs on the adjacent side. Once browned on both sides the Knafe is finished.
9. The last step is to top the Knafe with the pine nuts and the sweet syrup and enjoy!
10. Sweet Syrup:
11. In a pot combine 3 cups of sugar with 1 1/2 cups of water. Mix and heat over stove till boiling process. Once boiling add a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice and boil for a few minutes more for thickening process. Let cool and use over Knafe once done baking.,

instructions, 1. Cut onion in to small pieces. Do not mince or chop too finely but at the same time do not cut or chop too coarsely. Set aside.
2. Wash carrots and cut them into 1/4" thick pieces. Basically you don't want them too thin or they will disintegrate into the broth. You can peel them if you prefer before cutting. Set aside.
3. In a large frying pan brown the meat with some seasoning salt and pepper. Add the onion and some olive oil from the bottle. Make sure all the meat is brown. Set aside.
4. In a stew pan fry the 3 tbsp of tomato paste in the 1/4 cup olive oil for about 5-8 minutes. If it seems dry-looking add a small amount of extra oil at a time. It should look chunky in the oil not runny like soup. Stir constantly it will burn very fast!
5. Reduce the heat add first 2 cups of water. Stand back it may spit at you! Keep adding until all 6 cups have been added. Add the soup cubes. Let this boil for 5 minutes. Scrape the bottom of the pan making sure all of the tomato paste mixes in the water.
6. Add the meat carrots and peas. Allow to come to a boil (takes about 5 minutes) then reduce heat to a simmer. Add salt and pepper to your taste. Cook until meat is tender. Cooking time depends on the quality of meat.
7. Serve with Middle Eastern rice.
8. Extra water may be added to counter-act any saltiness or if too much evaporated out while cooking.
9. Cooking times may vary depending on stove type. Just keep on eye on it and never walk away from cooking food! Stainless steel or a non-stick pan may be used. I prefer non-stick. This may also be transferred to a large crock pot and set on low. Yield depends on how much water is allowed to boil out but pretty much it makes a lot! Count on leftovers if you're not having people over.,

instructions, 1. Mix all of the dry ingredients together in a large sturdy bowl (hard plastic or stainless steel).  Form a little well in the center.
2. Heat the water in a microwave safe dish for one minute.
3. Pour the water into the flour well and mix the ingredients with a spatula as far you can.  Place a dish of cool water in a bowl next to you as you begin to knead by hand.
4. Knead the dough in the bowl by hand for at least 5-10 minutes dipping your fingertips into the bowl of water as you knead.  This will help create a smooth elastic finish.  You know your dough is ready when the surface is smooth and doesn't have pock-marks.  The dough will feel slightly sticky as you knead it but should not stick to your hands.
5. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and cut with a knife (or separate by hand) into equal sized pieces - 8 for larger rounds or 20 for small pitettes.  Roll each piece into a smooth ball and lay on clean dish cloth or floured cutting board or surface keeping them covered with another cloth.
6. Once all of the balls are rolled and resting cover them with a clean cloth and lightly pat the cloth with water on your finger tips to keep them moist or spray lightly with a water mister.  Let the balls rest for 30 minutes.
7. After 30 minutes rest preheat oven to 450 degrees with a baking stone or pizza pan on bottom rack inserted.
8. As the oven preheats roll each ball on a lightly floured surface into a flat round no thicker than 1/4".  The thinner the round the better your pocket.  Turn them over to roll them trying to keep the round as best you can.  If the dough sticks to the rolling pin dip your finger tips in a little flour and coat the surface of the round as you roll.  Make sure the edges are rolled out equally and not thicker than the center.  Lay each round on the cloth or floured surface to rest again as the oven preheats.  Keep them in the order your rolled them.
9. Once the oven is ready bake each round (or several at a time depending on size) on your baking stone being careful to place them BOTTOM SIDE UP for 90 seconds to 2 minutes.  The rounds should start to bubble on top and will "poof" up with the pocket.  Once the pocket is formed remove them from the oven and place onto clean surface to cool. The bottoms will be just starting to brown as you remove them from the oven.
10. Once completely cooled they can be stored in a freezer bag and frozen until ready to use - they will thaw quickly on the counter.,

Drizzle the dough with olive oil and place in a warm spot covered with a damp towel. Let rise until the dough doubles in size; depending on the temperature it could take 30 minutes to 1 1/2 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F and lay a baking tray in the oven to heat.
3. Once the dough has doubled in size cut the dough into 10 to 12 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and then flatten each using a rolling pin. Use flour on the work surface so that it doesn't stick. Place 3 to 4 flattened pita on the hot tray and close the oven door immediately. Bake until puffed up about 5 minutes.

Let it rise 1 hour until the dough has doubled in volume.
3. Punch down dough and knead in garlic (you can put more less or no garlic depending on your taste). Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball. Roll into balls and place on a tray. Cover with a towel and allow to rise until doubled in size about 30 minutes.
4. During the second rising preheat the grill (or skillet) to high heat. A grill would be best but if you don't have a grill ready to use you can use a skillet they just won't come out as pretty.
5. At grill side roll one ball of dough out into a thin circle. Lightly oil grill. Place dough on grill and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until puffy and lightly browned. Brush uncooked side with butter and turn over. Brush cooked side with butter and cook until browned another 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from grill and continue the process until all the naan has been prepared.,

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Margarine the bottom and sides of a 9X13 - inch baking dish.
2. 2. In a small saucepan heat the water and sugar until the sugar is completely dissolved. Add the vanilla and agave nectar. Simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. You want this to be completely cooled before pouring onto the baked baklava.
3. 3. Pulse the nuts in a food processor until they're a coarse meal (not fine crumbs). Add the cinnamon and mix. Set aside.
4. 4. Carefully unroll the phyllo dough from the package. Trim the stack of dough into 9x13 inch sheets so they fit into the pan (I use Athens Fillo Dough and it fits almost perfectly so I don't trim it down). Keep the sheets that you're not working with covered with some waxed paper and a damp cloth (the waxed paper goes directly on top of the dough the wet towel on top. If you have a helper they can lift the paper/cloth as needed makes it easier). Place 2 sheets of dough in the pan and using a pastry brush coat the top sheet completely with margarine. Spread a thin layer of the nut mixture add 2 more sheets of phyllo. Repeat with the butter nut mixture and 2 phyllo sheets until you have a total of 8 layered sheets. For the top layer place 2-4 phyllo sheets but this time brush margarine between each individual sheet.
5. 5. Using a very sharp knife carefully cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. This is important to do now because you won't be able to cut the baklava once it's baked without crushing the pastry.
6. 6. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until the baklava is golden.  Remove from the oven and immediately pour or spoon the (completely cooled) sauce over. Cool uncovered for at least 3 hours or overnight before serving.,

7. I like to cook roasts at lower temperatures for a long time so I veered off from the given recipe and cooked it for 3 hours at 250 Fahrenheit.  If I had had more time I would probably have cooked it 4 hours at 200 degrees Fahrenheit. The meat was tender due to both the yogurt and the long cooking.  My leg of lamb was 1.3 kilos or 2.8 pounds.  Serve with flavored basmati rice.,

instructions, 1. To make the yoghurt pour a gallon of milk in a pot with a very heavy bottom and put it on the fire until it starts to boil or even just foam heavily.
2. Stir occasionaly to prevent the milk from burning.
3. Turn off the heat and let the milk cool (stir to cool quicker) just until you can stick your pointer finger way down it without getting burned.
4. Take the active yoghurt culture and pour it down the side of the pan into the milk. I usually do this is a couple of different spots.
5. Cover the milk with a close fitting lid and wrap the pot well in a heavy blanket or two. You are holding in that heat and it will soon start to generate it's own heat which you are also conserving with the blanket.
6. Place it somewhere warm where it won't be disturbed for 24 hours. I have successfully made this after the yoghurt was let to develop from 24 - 36 hours.
7. If you'd rather merely wrap the pot in a bath-towel -wrap the lid too- and set it on a heating pad on low. I've started doing this and it works great too.
8. After you have yoghurt dump it into an inside out pillow case (lint will be in the inside corners) and suspend the pillow case up over a drain of some sort. I tie mine up to the safety bar on the wall over the bathtub (less traffic than the kitchen sink).
9. The yoghurt will begin to drain whey immediately I let mine go for 24-36 hours depending on how stiff or soft (w/ remaining liquid content) I want it. Usually 24 hours.
10. When it's as firm as you'd like turn the cheese into a mixing bowl and salt to taste. I use around 1 1/2 - 2 tablespoons salt. I know it's a lot. I think the salt was originally a preservative but that's the way I like it.
11. Elias' mum used to make balls of this cheese and store it in stoneware crocks covered in olive oil. I keep it in a mixing bowl in the fridge smoothed flat and covered in olive oil. It keeps a long time like that. If it's going to be eaten quickly doesn't need the oil for preserving just eating : ).
12. Enjoy this for a n Arabic breakfast with flat bread (pita) and olive oil. It is also good flavored with garlic dill or za'ater to your taste. Also pine nuts!,

instructions, 1. NOTE: YOU NEED 1 bukhoor coal cut into 4 pieces.
2. Make sure the skin is left on the chicken. This is one of the keys for cooking mandy because the skin produces natural fat to cook in the spices. This is why we do not use an oil. Rub mandy spice and sea salt to taste all over chicken pieces. Place in a non-stick saute pan (or a well seasoned cast iron pan is what I use) cook chicken uncovered with no oil until tender and brown. Place cooked chicken on a plate reserving the pan remnants in the pan as they are.
3. In a separate pan saute finely chopped onion with 1 tbs butter until tender. Add the whole bruised cardamom pods cloves chicken stock sea salt to taste and drained Basmati rice; stir. Bring to a full boil add chopped tomatoes then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook (do not remove lid) for 15 minutes or as long as you cook your rice usually.
4. After the chicken and rice are done pour the rice into the saute pan used to cook the chicken mix around if transferring back to the other pot which I suggest if you use a cast iron pan like I do. Place the onion shell bowl into the middle of the rice. If you make a indent in the rice it is easier. Melt butter and pour into onion bowl. Carefully place chicken around the pan slightly close to the onion bowl. Add a hot bit of coal into the melted butter and quickly shut the lid. Allow to smoke for 15 minutes adding a new coal as needed. You may use 3 or 4 pieces of the same bukhoor coal.
5. Remove onion bowl carefully and discard.

Add ground beef and cook until there is no more redness of the beef ( or until the meat is cooked through).Remove or drain excess oil. Season with soy sauce or salt and pepper. Let cool before preparing the Lumpia.
2. TO ASSEMBLE:
3. Prepare a bowl of water to use as sealant. Gently separate the lumpia wrapper as they are very frail and thin. Then place them one at a time on a flat surface or on the large plate. Place a heaping 2 to 3 tablespoon of the filling diagonally near the one corner of the wrapper - leaving 1 1/2 inch space on each corner. Take the bottom and top edges of the wrapper and fold them towards the center. Take the left and right sides and fold them towards the center. Moisten the last edge of the wrapper to seal. Now repeat using the rest of the wrappers. You can cook the lumpia right away or you can freeze them. I usually line the lumpia with an inch distance from each other on a cookie sheet and freeze them then when they are hard put them together in a zip loc. It will prevent the lumpia from sticking to each other. You do not need to thaw the lumpia when you are ready to cook them.Cook 3 to 4 pieces at a time by deep frying. Make sure to cook it in medium fire and that it is cook through in the inside. Sometimes I have to re cook the Lumpia because of this.,

cuisine, Asian >> Southeast Asian >> Filipino, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Chop all vegetables.  If you use chayote just cut it in half from where the dip is.  It's similar to a mango with the shape of the pit being flat but the pit is soft unlike in a mango so there's no need to cut around it.  Remove the pit/seed from the two halves. Dice peeling is not necessary.
2. A note about the tamarind soup mix:  If you're vegetarian or sensitive to MSG check the ingredients on the packet.  I think they all have MSG and most have pork fish or beef in them.  I found tamarind broth cubes (listed as tamarind powder b/c Zaar doesn't recognize it) which have less of those things in them which is great but the best is if you can find real tamarind.  I have found both of these in Asian grocery stores in the US though you can occasionally find them in the ethnic foods isle of a grocery store.  If you're using tamarind remove the hard outer shell.  The insides feel and sometimes smell like the insides of raisins or prunes.  If the tamarind tastes sweet  it's not going to give you the right flavor for the soup but can still be close with kalamansi or lemon juice added.  It should be a sour taste.  Soak the tamarind pulp seeds and all in 1 cup of warm water.  Mash this with a fork to remove most of the tamarind from the seeds.  Fish out the seeds and the membranes and reserve the liquid to add after potatoes are cooked.
3. Cook potatoes in water with a touch of salt for about 10 minutes or until almost cooked through.
4. Add remaining veggies and seasoning and cook 10-15 minutes more or until veggies are cooked to desired consistency.
5. Taste broth and adjust water and tamarind seasoning and salt to your liking.  Keep in mind that if you're serving this with rice as I always do you probably want more intense flavors and a more stew like consistency.
6. I typically double this recipe since it keeps well in the refrigerator and it gets eaten quite quickly even with just me and my husband.  It is important to cook the potatoes before you cook the other veggies because the acid from the tomatoes and the tamarind mix prevent the potatoes from ever cooking through if you add them straight away.  The quantities are still an approximation as I've never measured so if you make this I'd love if you gave me feedback about your input on amounts of water what seasoning you used etc.,

instructions, 1. Combine ½ cup sugar and ½ cup of water in a frying pan. This will form the latik (caramel topping) layer in the final product.
2. Caramelize this mixture by stirring constantly over medium heat until it thickens to a thick syrup consistency and turns amber colored.
3. Pour caramelized sugar syrup into baking pan and set it aside to cool.
4. Combine evaporated milk condensed milk 3 egg yolks 2 whole eggs and 1 tsp vanilla in a sauce pan and stir together. This will form the custard layer.
5. Cook over low heat stirring continuously until it thickens to a yogurt-like consistency.
6. Pour the custard over the cooled latik.
7. At this point start preheating your oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit).
8. Sift the flour baking powder salt and 1 cup of sugar together in a medium size mixing bowl.
9. Make a well in the dry ingredients and add the following in order: oil 8 egg yolks orange juice and 1 tsp vanilla.
10. Stir this mixture together until smooth.
11. In another larger mixing bowl combine the egg whites and cream of tartar.
12. Whisk the egg white mixture together until it combines and the mixture gets frothy.
13. Using either a whisk if you have lots of stamina in your arms or a hand mixer continue to rapidly mix the egg whites until peaks begin to form.
14. Continuing to mix rapidly slowly add the ½ cup of sugar just a little at a time.
15. After sugar is incorporated continue to mix rapidly until stiff peaks form.
16. Fold in the yolk mixture to the egg whites until well blended. This mixture will form the chiffon cake layer.
17. Pour the batter of the chiffon on top of the custard mixture.
18. Place your baking pan into a larger pan with water; this will allow the cake/custard to steam as it bakes. If your baking pan leaks (for example if you used a spring-form pan as I did) then you could put it into an oven safe steamer.
19. Bake and steam in the oven (at 350) for 50-70 minutes until golden brown. When it is done a toothpick inserted at the center of the cake should come out almost clean clean (slightly damp but no batter or major crumbs).
20. Remove the cake from the oven and let cool completely before inverting.
21. Invert after fully cooled; depending on the pan you use you may notice a depression form in the center; this won't affect the taste and hopefully someone will comment with a way to avoid it; My only idea is to try using a tube pan so there is no center to fall.,

3. When the mixture becomes a bit dry and the rice has not softened yet you may pour in more milk or water as needed until the rice is fully cooked and the desired consistency is reached. See below. I prefer a thicker porridge rather than a watery one.

instructions, 1. NOTE: Season as desired with salt and pepper at each stage. But season lightly: dish should be undersalted since it will be eaten with salty bagoong.
2. Place the onion and oxtail in a large pot. Add water to cover. Bring to the boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2.5 to 3 hours or until tender. (Or cook for 35 minutes in the pressure cooker at high pressure.).
3. When preparing the banana blossom and eggplant as you slice put the pieces into water with a bit of lemon juice to prevent them turning brown.
4. Heat a big skillet or wok and add vegetable oil. Saute the garlic. Add the eggplant banana blossom and long beans; cook for 10 minutes. Add baby bok choy and cook for 5 minutes more until vegetables are crisp-tender. Reserve vegetables.
5. Remove meat from broth keeping broth in pot. If desired when cool enough to handle remove meat from bones. Add meat to vegetable mixture; reserve.
6. Add a little broth to the peanut butter; stir until well blended adding more broth if necessary. Bring the broth to a simmer. In a bowl combine annatto powder with cold water; mix until smooth; add annatto mixture to broth. Simmer stirring until sauce thickens and does not taste floury.
7. Add meat and vegetables and cook until heated through. Meat should be very tender; vegetables should be tender but not falling apart. If desired add water to make more sauce.
8. Serve with bagoong (fermented shrimp paste). I prefer the guisado (sauteed) kind regular flavor (not sweet or hot).
9. * NOTE * Fresh banana blossom should be large and dense and feel tightly packed. * To clean: First take off the outer dark red bracts and accompanying tiny matchsticks (baby bananas!) -- these are inedible. Continue until you reach the pale pink/yellow inside and it's becoming difficult to peel apart. Cut off the inedible stem. Cut blossom into 1-inch slices dropping into lemon water to prevent browning. Separate the blossoms (like you would leeks). If possible let them soak for a little while to remove any bitterness. * You can use the same water for the eggplant. *.,

instructions, 1. Finely dice the onion and garlic (note that this is a whole head of garlic not just a single clove.).
2. Brown the finely diced onion and the garlic in a large pot with a little oil.
3. Cut the pork or chicken into 1”x1” to 1”x3” pieces. If using bone-in just cut away some of the larger pieces from the bone.
4. Add the 1 cup of vinegar and 1 cup of water to the onion/garlic.
5. Bring it to a low boil at about medium-high.
6. Add the meat and continue to cook at or near boiling for a minimum of 20 minutes.
7. Sometime during the 20 minutes add the balsamic vinegar (to taste). I usually cook it for more than 20 minutes. The extra time doesn’t hurt the meat and actually makes it tenderer (Probably because of the vinegar).
8. With about ten minutes left add the soy sauce.
9. If you cook it as long as I do (30-40 minutes) you will want to have an extra cup of water and some vinegar (white) on hand since the mixture will probably reduce too much.
10. When the meat is tender pull it out of the gravy and brown it in a little oil in a separate pan. I sometimes sprinkle a little bit of paprika on it at this point for both color and flavor.
11. While the meat is browning use a cold water roux made from a one-to-one ratio of  cornstarch and water to thicken the remaining gravy.
12. The meat can be remixed with the gravy after browning or served separately. I usually put the meat and gravy together and serve it over the rice. Sometimes I serve the chicken and rice separately dousing both with gravy.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 300. Put 2 eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil cover turn off heat and let sit for 5 minutes. Remove eggs and place in cold water to cool then peel and cut in half lengthwise.
2. In a large mixing bowl beat the remaining 2 eggs and combine with the cheese ham peas raisins onion sausages relish ketchup salt and a few cracks of black pepper. Fold in the ground pork then mix it with your hands until thoroughly combined and the mixture starts to stick together. Heat a dry frying pan over medium heat and cook a spoonful of the mixture. Taste the mixture and add more salt or pepper if needed.
3. Line a large baking pan with greased foil leaving some overhang on all sides. Spread the embutido mixture into a rectangle about 12 by 17 inches. Place the boiled egg halves in a line down one of the long sides of the rectangle. Starting from that edge lift the foil to roll the meat mixture — with the eggs — over itself and roll all the way to the other side to form a cylinder (like a jelly roll). Pat the embutido to create a uniform shape and wrap the foil tightly around it crimping the ends to seal.
4. Place the foil-wrapped embutido in the center of the pan and place in the oven. After 45 minutes remove the embutido and turn on the broiler. Unwrap the foil and let embutido rest for 10 minutes then broil until lightly browned about 3 minutes. Let rest 3 minutes then slice.
5. While the embutido is roasting set a small saucepan over medium-high heat and combine 3 tablespoons calamansi juice soy sauce and broth. Simmer until reduced by half. Thoroughly combine the cornstarch with the remaining calamansi juice and whisk into the sauce. Bring to a boil and when it is thickened remove from heat. When embutido is cooked reheat sauce over medium heat until steaming then whisk in butter one chunk at a time to emulsify.
6. Serve embutido on a platter with watercress and sauce with steamed white rice on the side.,

instructions, 1. Brown ground pork and drain.  Add all ingredients diced as fine as you can and toss on low heat for 10 minutes or until vegetables are al dente.  place in a bowl and allow to cool.
2. The trick to rolling a proper lumpia is to put about a tablespoon of the meat vegetable mixture apx 1/4" from the bottom of the lumpia wrapper.  Flip that 1/4" over the top of the mix and tuck it underneath and make it tight.  Roll it like a cigar for 1 roll and then tuck in the sides like a burrito and continue rolling until the last roll.  Moisten the last 1/4" with water  to seal it like an envelope.
3. Once you get to this stage you can deep fry refrigerate or freeze the lupia.  Regardless when you do fry them fry until the outside is very light brown and place on a plate with a paper towel to dry excess oil.  Serve with a sweet and sour sauce.,

instructions, 1. Soak rice and lentils together in hot water for about a half hour.
2. Drain the water as much as possible.
3. Put rice and lentils into a pressure cooker add 7 1/2 cups of clean water turmeric garam masala and salt to make the water nice and briny. However salty you want your Kichadi to be your water should taste a little brinier than that.
4. Let the pressure cooker whistle 2 or 3 times then open up to see the consistency of the Kichadi. It should be soft and a little loose. I find pressure cookers to be very inconsistent in how they cook from one model to the next so yours may require more or less whistles.
5. In a sauteé pan put oil and bring up to heat.
6. Add your serrano chillies that have been deseeded. If you do not deseed them the dish will be overwhelmingly hot.
7. Add the asofetida. Sauteé the chillies until they get quite brown but not burned.
8. Add your chopped Cilantro and sauteé until the leaves are wilted.
9. Add in Coriander powder and chilli powder. At this point you may need to add a little more oil to the pan due to all the powder. Cook for no more than 30 seconds so that the powder doesn't burn.
10. Empty the contents of your sauteé pan into your Kichadi and stir it inches There will be plenty of powder stuck to the sauteé pan. So as not to lose these spices take a little Ghee and melt it in the pan. Swish it around to get all the spices and pour into your Kichadi.
11. Serve Kichadi with a dollop of ghee and a generous squirt of lime to finish it off.

instructions, 1. The marinade needs to be a smooth paste.Put the 1st 6 ingredients EXCEPT chicken into a blender with a splash of water and puree.
2. Place sliced chicken in a bowl and spread the marinade over coating each piece.  Cover and refrigerate for about 30 minutes though you can leave it longer or even overnight is best.
3. When you're ready to cook the dish put a large pot preferably heavy bottomed over a medium heat. Add the oil. When it's hot stir in the cinnamon and cardamom for a few seconds.
4. Add onion and cook for 5 minutes until it starts to soften. It will turn brown from the cinnamon.
5. Add cumin and coriander then gradually add the yoghurt stirring all the time.
6. Add the tomato paste and mix in well reduce the heat.
7. Put the chicken and its marinade into the pan and cook for about 5 minutes.
8. Pour the water into the pan and still in the garam masala if you have any. I have made this without it and it is so flavorful that I didn't really miss it.
9. Bring to a simmer and cook uncovered stirring frequently for 15 minutes or so until the sauce has reduced to a thick spoon able consistency. Remove from heat stir in lemon juice and serve.
10. I serve this with naan bread mango peach or apricot chutney and rice flavored with cooked onions. You want a fairly plain rice as the dish is so flavorful a strongly seasoned rice would mask the wonderful flavors of the dish.
11. Servings being difficult to judge as a serving is different to everyone. So I am listing this as 4 servings for hearty appetites. Cooking does not include marinating time. Boneless thighs work well for this too; just cut into fairly wide strips.,

instructions, 1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil with a pinch of salt.  I like to use a large saute pan with a fitted lid to save on dishes later.  Add in quinoa and cook until tender (about 12-13 minutes).  Should be tender but still slightly crunchy.  While that is cooking cut up the cauliflower into small florets.
2. Place the frozen peas in a colander.  Drain the boiled quinoa over the peas and set aside.  If you are making your broth using a powder try to reserve 1-1 1/2 cups of this liquid to prepare your broth. (I put my measuring cup underneath the colander).
3. Rinse out you pot/pan and dry it returning it to the stove and heating the oil over medium-high heat.  Saute the onion and garlic for about 5 minutes until it starts to become translucent.  Add in the whole spices and let them toast with the onions for about 30 seconds then add in the rest of the spices and let them 'marry' for another 30 seconds or so.  (Careful not to burn).
4. Stir in the broth and bring to a boil.  Add the cauliflower cover and return to a boil.  Once back to boiling reduce the heat to about medium and let the cauliflower become tender stirring occasionally.  Adjust the seasoning at this point the amount of salt required will depend on your broth.  I like my cauliflower a little softer so this step takes about 8-10 minutes for me but could be done as soon as 4 minutes - adjust the cooking time to your liking.  Remove from heat once done.
5. Put the plain yogurt into a bowl and temper it by adding a few tablespoons of the cauliflower liquid into it.  Then add the yogurt mixture to the cauliflower.  (This is so the yogurt doesn't curdle).  Fold in the quinoa and the peas then the cashews and cilantro.  Check seasoning again.
6. Serve with some chutney on the side and enjoy!  Note --  I have made this using part millet as well.  You just have to adjust the cooking time as millet takes longer than quinoa by about 5 minutes.,

instructions, 1. For the marinade mix the yoghurt salt turmeric and the chopped chillies. Chop up or joint the chicken and coat it in the marinade and leave covered to stand at room temperature for an hour (to prevent it from splitting when cooked). Chop the onion and tomatoes into small chunks and reserve. In a large pan over a medium melt your ghee or butter until it begins to sizzle and pop in the coriander and cumin seeds plus the cardamom cloves a little salt and onions frying until the onions brown a little.
2. Next drop in the ginger and garlic and cook for approximately 5 gently stirring then add the chopped tomatoes and garam masala stirring for another 5 minutes or so until the mix is bubbling gently and on the verge of being a little sticky. Now it’s time for the chicken to join the party (but hold back 2 tbs of the yoghurt mix) so add the pieces and fry on high for 3/4 minutes until the meat has turned from raw to white. Turn the heat down to low cover and cook for a further 25 minutes adding a little water to stop it from sticking check regularly and fold in the rest of the yoghurt after 10 minutes. Keep an eye on this dish and make sure that you regularly stir it to keep the yoghurt from splitting. Either serve straight away (or keep for the next day tends to taste better) garnishing with coriander.

instructions, 1. Stir together the flour pepper ground cumin seed and salt in a large bowl or in the food processor; mix thoroughly until the spices are evenly distributed.
2. Add the garlic and mix well.
3. Add enough of the water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball; if necessary add up to 1 additional tablespoon water.
4. The dough should be fairly stiff and dry; if it is too wet it will not roll well.
5. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes by hand or pulse for about 15 seconds in the food processor; the dough should be smooth.
6. With your hands shape the dough into a cylinder or log about 2 inches thick and 6 inches long.
7. With a sharp knife cut the cylinder into 1/2-inch thick slices.
8. The next step uses oil so do not use your pastry cloth and rolling pin sleeve.
9. Place each slice on a lightly oiled surface.
10. Lightly oil the top of the slice and then roll out into a very thin circle about 6 or 7 inches in diameter.
11. Papadams must be rolled extremely thin maximum 1/16 inch.
12. If the dough sticks to your rolling pin gently pull it off.
13. Dust the tops of each papadam with cayenne pepper.
14. Using a metal spatula to loosen the edges of the papadams from the rolling surface carefully place them on large baking sheets.
15. The traditional method for preparing and frying papadams is described below; you can also bake them in a 300F oven for about 15 to 25 minutes or until crisp and dry.
16. The cooking time may vary beyond this range depending upon the thickness and moisture in the rolled dough.
17. Cool them on a rack.
18. To prepare the papadams in an authentic manner don't bake them; first allow them to dry by leaving them in the sun for a few hours or by placing them in a very low oven (less than 200F) for 1 to 2 hours turning occasionally.
19. Dry the papadams until they are just slightly flexible and show no moisture; they should not brown or bake however.
20. At this point the papadams may be stacked flat and stored in an airtight container until needed; they will keep for months if stored properly.
21. When ready to serve heat about 1/8 inch of oil in a large skillet; the oil should be hot but not smoking; a drop of water flicked into the skillet should sizzle immediately.
22. One at a time drop the papadams into the hot oil.
23. Turn the papadam when it begins to curl at the edges; it will quickly fry and become crisp.
24. Remove it before it turns brown.
25. Cool and drain the papadams on paper towels and eat them immediately.,

Now add the garlic ginger fresh coriander (or keep it and use it as a garnish at the end) turmeric and cayenne pepper. Cover leaving the lid very slightly ajar lower heat and simmer gently for about 1 1/2 hours. Stir occasionaly. When dal is cooked add the salt and lemon juice (it should be thicker than pea soup but thinner than cooked cereal.
2. In a 4-6-inch skillet or small pot heat the vegetable oil or ghee over a medium-high flame. When hot add the asafetida and cumin seeds. As soon as the asafetida sizzles and expands and the cumin seeds turn dark (this will take only a few seconds) pour the oil and spices over the dal (lentils) and serve. (Some people put the dal in a serving dish and then pour the oil and spices over it.).
3. To serve: Serve with plain rice and a vegetable for a simple meal. Most meat and chicken dishes go well with this dal. Since some people like to squeeze extra lemon or lime juice on their dal serve some wedges separately. Note: Finely sliced onion rings fried until brown and crisp are often spread over the dal as a garnish before it is served.,

instructions, 1. Ghee:
2. In a heavy skillet over medium to medium low heat heat the butter until it is completely melted. Watch as the butter boils first with large bubbles and white milk solids floating on the surface then with only a fine white foam filling the entire surface. Stir occasionally.
3. Soon small patches of golden brown will appear on the surface and the overall color of the butter will change from yellow to golden. Push aside the foam periodically to check the color of the sediment. When the sediment turns light brown remove from the heat. (see note)
4. Decant into a jar with a tight lid. Warm if desired for serving over rice
5. Note: If you heat until the sediment turns dark brown the ghee will lose it's flavor and taste like vegetable oil.
6. In a heavy 4 quart pot combine the sugar and water and boil together until candy thermometer registers 225 degrees F and a small amount of the syrup forms a thin thread between the thumb and forefinger when carefully sampled from the stirrer
7. Reduce heat to medium and stir in the almond paste with 1/4 cup ghee. Stir in the rest of the ghee in 1/4 cup increments until all of it has been absorbed. Keep stirring over medium to medium low heat; the mixture will become a single mass and will roll around in the pan. If the mixture begins to brown lower the heat. Continue stirring until the mixture becomes porous and starts to appear drier – this can take up to 10 minutes.
8. Spread the mixture in an ungreased 9-inch square baking pan and press into 1/2 inch thickness. Immediately sprinkle with the almonds gently pressing them into the surface. While still warm cut into 36 squares or diamond shapes.
9. Serve at room temperature.,

instructions, 1. Using a non stick (or heavy bottomed) sauce pan add milk and heat on medium heat until nearly bubbling at the edges and steaming.
2. Slowly whisk in the meal and whisk slowly until the meal is suspended in the milk meaning none hanging out at the bottom of the pot. Continue whisking off and on until it reaches a medium thick hot cereal consistency. Again you *can* walk away and whisk every 5 minutes or so.
3. Turn stove to low heat and continue to whisk off and on while it thickens. No need to be afraid. I have left it unattended for over 10 minutes and it will not scorch lump or stick.
4. When it reaches 'thick hot cereal' stage stir in remaining ingredients. I usually whisk. Mix well to combine evenly.
5. Leave pudding on low stirring/whisking occasionally until thickened a bit more; 10-15 minutes approximately.
6. Turn off heat and let the pan sit until it has cooled down half way then cover with the lid and let it 'set.' Times will vary with setting. Last night it was 15 minutes or so and in 2 hours I could upturn the pan. Refrigerate and reheat gently; I use the microwave for individual servings.
7. I used the high end of the cook time and will depend on your corn meal heat of stove etc -- I have seen many recipes making this pudding appear scary; stand at stove and never stop whisking the entire time. Fiddley sticks!,

2. You can grill fry or oven cook meat in any way you like. I often fry in oil adding a little turmeric and garlic.  Once cooked set the pre-cooked meat aside.
3. Base Sauce.
4. Chop onions ginger and Garlic roughly and fry in oil until cooked add hot water just enought to cover onions and garlic you may not need all 500ml. Then simmer for 20 minutes.
5. After 20 minutes take off heat let cool then blend with either a hand blender or in traditional blender then set aside.
6. Spice Mix.
7. While the base sauce is cooling this is a good time to prepare you spice mix just put all the spices in one bowl and mix together.
8. The Curry.
9. Heat oil to medium heat and fry garlic and ginger for about 2 – 3 minutes towards the end of the 3 minutes turn the heat down to very low.
10. Once the oil garlic and ginger have cooked and cooled a little add the spice mix a spoon at a time you want to make a paste when the oil blends with the spices so you may not need all the spice mix or you may need to add more oil.
11. Once you have a runny oily paste turn the heat up very slightly be very careful because if the spices burn the whole dish will be ruined. The trick is not to fry the spices just heat them sufficiently enough to bring out all the aromas and flavours this should take only a few minutes.
12. Then add the tomatoes curry base orange salt bay leaf cinnamon chicken stock cube and pre cooked chicken stirring the dish well.
13. Let simmer for at least 20 mins but can be left for hours.
14. 5 mins before you are ready to serve add the coriander and Ghee then dish up I would recommend to serve with chapattis or basmati rice.,

instructions, 1. In a small pan over a medium heat bring the water to the boil; add the salt and turmeric; reduce to a simmer and cover tightly.
2. In a larger - preferably heavy-based - pan over a medium heat heat the ghee or oil; add the yellow asafetida powder and chopped onion and stir to combine for 1-2 minutes add the rice and sauté for about 2 minutes or until the rice becomes whitish in colour.
3. Carefully pour the simmering water into the pan containing the rice stir briefly and if the peas you are using are fresh add them now; increase the heat so that the water is again boiling then reduce to a very low heat and cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid.
4. Simmer the rice for 15-20 minutes or until the water has been absorbed by the rice and the rice is tender and flaky; if you are using frozen peas add them 5 minutes before the end of this stage of the cooking; stir through the rice quickly and replace the lid as soon as you can.
5. Remove the pan from the heat and leave it covered and undisturbed for 5 minutes to allow the grains to firm up.
6. Fold in the cashews chopped baby spinach leaves and chopped coriander leaves and stir well to combine the ingredients.
7. Serve hot garnished with the remaining herbs.
8. NOTES: (i) I have suggested adding the chopped baby spinach leaves in step six as baby spinach leaves wilt very quickly once they come into contact with something like hot rice.  If you would like your spinach leaves not just wilted but cooked add them when adding the frozen peas towards the end of the cooking time in step four.  (ii) The Zaar Kitchen Dictionary suggests that either garlic powder or onion powder are suitable substitutions for yellow asafetida powder.,

instructions, 1. Wrappers:In a high-speed blender puree the coconut with the coconut water cayenne and salt until completely smooth. Using an offset spatula spread the coconut very thin on Teflex-lined dehydrator trays and dehydrate at 115 F for 2 to 4 hours or until the surface is dry. Carefully flip over and peel away the Teflex sheets. Dehydrate further on the screen only just to dry the underside 15 to 30 minutes longer. The wraps should be very thin almost transparent and very pliable.
2. Carefully slide the wraps onto a flat cutting surface and cut into large rectangles about 3 by 7 inches and set aside.
3. Filling:Place the cauliflower florets in a food processor and pulse a few times to chop into small pieces. It’s okay if they are not entirely uniform in size - they add texture.
4. In a high-speed blender add the nuts water garam masala Chunky Chat and ginger and puree at high speed for 2 minutes until completely smooth. It should be the consistency of heavy cream. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
5. Add the cauliflower peas and macadamia cream to a shallow glass bowl or pan and stir to combine. Place the bowl in the dehydrator and dehydrate at 115 F for about 2 hours stirring occasionally until the cauliflower becomes somewhat tender and the cream thickens a bit.
6. Toss the cilantro in with the cauliflower mixture just before filling the wraps.
7. To make: Place a heaping tbs of cauliflower filling at one end of a coconut wrapper. Fold one corner over diagonally to meet the other side to form a triangle. Fold the samosa over and continue folding like a flag. Wet the end of the wrapper slightly to seal.
8. For Tamarind Sauce:Place the tamarind pulp maple syrup nama shoyu and olive oil in a blender and puree until smooth. Taste for seasoning and add a pinch of salt if necessary. Place in a separate bowl and set aside. This sauce may be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 2 days. It can also be frozen if you have leftovers or want to make it in advance.

instructions, 1. In a medium saucepan melt butter over medium heat.  Add chopped onion and salt.  Saute until soft about five minutes.  Add garlic and saute until fragrant about 30 seconds.
2. Add remaining spices and stir.  Saute for about 1 minute cooking spices.  If spices start to stick to pan add some water - 1/4 cup should do.  Add peas and stir to coat with butter onion and spice mixture.  Add broth 1/2 cup water and bring to boil.  Cover and reduce heat to simmer.
3. Simmer for 40-50 minutes or until peas are tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed.  (Check peas periodically - you may need to add more water during cooking if peas are absorbing the liquid too quickly).  Garnish with chopped cilantro/coriander leaves before serving.
4. Options:  Serve with hot basmati or brown rice for a filling one-dish meal.  Or double the broth/water to make a curried pea soup.    To turn this into a spicy curry add some finely chopped jalapeno serrano or chile pepper at the same time as the garlic.
5. Update 1/6/2010:  Some people have reported issues with the peas taking longer to soften.  I have never had an issue but try cooking the onions without salt and waiting until the last 10 minutes or so of cooking time to add the salt.  I have heard salt interfers with lentils softening perhaps it is the same for split peas.  Curry powder - I usually use a mild Indian yellow variety the all-purpose kind found in most US supermarkets.  But I have also made this with a hot Madras and it was also delicious (but spicy!).,

instructions, 1. Cover dried chilies with some boiling water and allow to stand until softened usually about 15 minutes.  Handling carefully so the chilies do not burn your hands mince with scissors.  If you are using fresh chilies simply slice into rings.
2. Dissolve tamarind paste in about a cup of water.
3. Heat butter in a large skillet then add onions.  Let them caramelize slightly then stir in 1 teaspoon each of turmeric and cumin powder.  After a few minutes add dissolved tamarind paste minced chilies ginger coconut milk and salt to taste.  Since this will be rather thick add some water.  Then simmer to allow all these spices and flavors to marry.  To add a little brightness add the juice of an orange.  Lime or lemon might be better.  The sauce can be made ahead and reheated before grilling your fish.  **The heat of this sauce is tempered by the flavor of the salmon.  It can also be tempered with some raita or chutney on the side or even just plain yogurt.  OR instead of using 2 chilies just use one.**.
4. Sprinkle salmon with salt a teaspoon of turmeric and a light dusting of cumin powder.
5. Grill salmon over a hot fire being careful not to overcook. Fresh salmon is far better when slightly rare JMHO.  I start with grilling the fleshy side down first.  After 3-4 minutes turn carefully so that skin side is down and grill another 3-4 minutes depending on the thickness of your fillet.  As you remove from the grill the skin which I don't find appetizing will stick to the grill easily skinning your fresh grilled fillet.
6. Serve with the curry sauce and garnish with cilantro.  Wash down with a chilled rose wine.,

instructions, 1. Separate out 200 ml of the fresh cream and stir in the 1 tsp of the garam masala and mix the two inches Melt half the butter in the microwave and mix into this. This is the marinade for the chicken that will go into the gravy.
2. Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and soak them in the marinade. Put this in the fridge and let it sit for half an hour.
3. After half an hour get the marinaded chicken out and put in an oven that has been preheated to 180 degree celsius and let the chicken grill with the fan on for 15-18 minutes (if you've got that in your oven if not just do it without the fan but keep checking the chicken to ensure it doesn't lose tenderness).
4. While you wait for the chicken to get marinaded boil the cashews and chopped up onions in the water till the onions start losing their colour and become soft.
5. Once the onions and cashews are boiled put them in a food processor and blitz them into a fine paste.
6. Put the oil in a vessel and when it starts to heat up put the remaining butter into it. As the butter melts pour the onion and cashew paste into this and keep stirring for about 5 minutes till the paste starts to turn brown.
7. In the food processor blitz the tomatoes into a fine puree such that no solid pieces are left. Add the puree to the onion and cashew paste in the vessel.
8. Add the kasuri methi red chilli powder (preferably MDH Deggi Mirch) garam masala salt and sugar to the tomatoes and cover while cooking the gravy. Reduce the gravy till the tomatoes are fully cooked and the consistency is thick. Allow it to cool after for 5-10 minutes.

instructions, 1. For the cheese balls: Bring the milk to boiling point.
2. Add the lime juice/ vinegar in little doses till the milk curdles completely and the liquid separates from the cheese.
3. Strain the cheese after washing it in a number of changes of water to ensure that there are no traces of the lime or vinegar left.
4. Hang it in a cheesecloth for about 40 mins to allow the remaining water to drip away.
5. Put the drained cheese on a plate or in a food processor.
6. Knead or blend on low to a smooth consistency.
7. Now add the baking powder and flour (if using)- add it only if the dough is too sticky and unmanageable.
8. In the mean while keep the water to boil and add the sugar to it.
9. Let it dissolve completely.
10. Skim away any impurities.
11. Bring to a simmering point.
12. While this is boiling shape the dough into 20 little walnut shaped balls if making rasgollas (balls in sugar syrup) and into flat shapes like patties for rasmalai.
13. Add the balls to the syrup (put one on a trial basis first if it breaks up you may need to add a little more flour to the dough. Otherwise you may end up with all of them forming a huge mess in the water) and simmer on low heat till the balls are double in size (about 10 mins)- for rasgollas you may have to boil them for around 20 mins and add the cardamom and saffron to the water.
14. Carefully remove the balls with a slotted spoon and keep aside for 3-4 mins to drain.
15. For the rasgollas pour the syrup over the balls when it has cooled and refrigerate till needed.
16. For the rasmalai you will have to make the thickened milk: Reduce the 500 ml milk to half (250 ml) on low heat stirring occasionally (add the cardamom powder to the milk as it simmers).
17. Add the sugar stir cool and refrigerate.
18. To serve pour the chilled milk over the cheese balls and refrigerate for atleast 30 mins.
19. Sprinkle with the saffron strands and the pistachios.
20. Alternatively you can add the saffron and rose water instead of the cardamom as the milk boils so that it gets coloured for a kesari rasmalai.
21. Note: Most of the time I do not thicken the milk too much but just bring the milk to a boil and add sugar and give the rasgollas a boil in the milk too and then chill.,

instructions, 1. Heat oil in a wok.
2. Once hot add cumin seeds and allow to crackle.
3. Once they stop crackling add peppercorns cardamoms cloves and the finely chopped green chillies followed by the thinly sliced onions.
4. Mix well and allow to stir-fry until nicely browned. You may add a few drops of water occasionally so as to not allow this mixture to stick to the bottom of the wok. (This takes a few minutes maybe 8-10 minutes on medium heat so be patient as the taste of this rice crucially depends on how well you perform this step). By now your kitchen will be smelling very aromatic.
5. Now add the finely chopped tomatoes and mix thoroughly.
6. Stir in a glass of water.
7. Cover and allow the tomatoes to soften by cooking on medium heat for about 10 minutes. You may uncover the wok after 5 minutes are done and stir the mixture thoroughly. If you feel it needs some water then you may add half a glass but I didn't feel it necessary.
8. Uncover add salt to taste and mix well.
9. Lower heat and gently fold in the leftover cooked long grain Indian Basmati rice. Mix thoroughly to ensure that the masala coats each and every grain of rice evenly.
10. Remove from heat.
11. Garnish with finely chopped corriander leaves and serve hot with yoghurt and mango pickle.

instructions, 1. Begin by heating the oil over medium and then adding in the leek. Allow it to cook for a few minutes and become tender turning that beautiful shade of bright green.  Add in the garlic and let that cook for a few minutes.
2. Next add the turmeric chili powder fresh green chili and salt. Let that cook for just a few minutes then add in the zucchini.
3. Add just enough water to the pot to nearly cover the zucchini about 1/2 an inch below.  Cover loosely and let that cook until the zucchini is tender about 10 minutes.
4. Meanwhile grind up the coconut flakes and cumin.  A coffee grinder that you use for spices works best.  You want it to be quite fine even paste like.
5. Once the zukes are cooked stir in the coconut/cumin mixture - mix it in well.  Turn off/move off the heat and then add in a few tbsp of creamer (or yogurt or coconut milk).  Adjust seasoning.
6. Cover loosely and let sit. The coconut needs some time to become tender -- otherwise it could feel chewy.  It may seem thin at first but it will thicken up a bit.  You can always leave it to sit on the back burner for a while and reheat gently prior to serving if you like.,

instructions, 1. One large casserole dish (9x13).
2. One sheet of heavy duty Reynolds Wrap – enough to line the entire pan and enough to cover the top when ingredients go inches.
3. Preheat oven to 350. Line the casserole dish with the Reynolds Wrap. Brown ground beef in a saucepan breaking it up as you go. No need for any additional oil or shortening just  put the beef in the pan and cook on medium heat until browned. While it is browning: Peel and then dice the large potatoes russets work best. I like to do a fine dice. Put them into the casserole dish. Dice one large tomato put it in the casserole dish. Wash and place the cherry tomatoes in the casserole dish they look beautiful in the dish and add a pop of flavor when you bite into one! Cut both ends off the cobs of corn strip the husk and silk and then cut it in half add to casserole. If you are feeding more than 4 make sure you have ½ of a corn on the cob for each person! Open the can of black beans put it in the casserole. You do not have to measure the spices carefully my measurements are an approximation of what we like. If you do not like dishes spicy cut back on the curry red pepper and the tikka masala. Less salty? Cut back on the chicken broth powder. I like to use chicken broth powder instead of salt in most recipes since it has a lot of salt in it but has other flavors as well. Anyway put all the spices into the casserole. By now your beef should be browned so put it in the casserole. Last but not least add the water.
4. Stir gently just to incorporate the spices and distribute all the ingredients more or less evenly and taste the broth you get. Adjust flavor to your liking (salt spiciness). Cover with the flap of Reynolds Wrap. It does not have to be sealed just covered.  Slide carefully into the oven on the middle rack and cook for 40 minutes. Check at 30 minutes! Some ovens cook differently. Carefully lift the flap of Reynolds Wrap when potatoes are fork tender and sauce is bubbly it is ready to serve. Sometimes the potatoes soak up the water so add water as needed so you have at least half the liquid you started with. Using the Reynolds Wrap rather than a lid for the casserole allows you easier access and it also allows some steam to escape which I like.
5. When your casserole is ready remove carefully from the oven. In a small to medium bowl put your sour cream water and flour. Whisk it with a fork until smooth- about 20 seconds. Stir it into your still bubbling casserole. It will thicken the sauce and incorporate all the flavors.
6. Best part other than the flavor is that if you did it right the Reynolds Wrap means no clean up of the casserole dish!
7. Bon appetit.,

instructions, 1. Marinade  --  Mix all the ingredients for the marinade in a large zip lock baggie then add the chicken and marinade at least 4 hours.  I like to marinade all day if possible.  The longer the better.
2. Chicken  --  Don't forget to take the chicken out of the refrigerator at least 30 minutes to take the chill off before cooking.  Either oil your outdoor grill grill pan or even a saute pan. Grill approximately 5-7 minutes per side (depending on the thickness of your chicken).  Once the chicken is done remove to a plate and cover with foil to let it rest while you make the sauce.
3. Sauce  -- In a small sauce pan add the white wine vinegar and the shallots and heat to medium to medium-high until the sauce is reduced by half. It doesn't take long 3-4 minutes is all. Add the cream and cook another 1-2 minutes -- Don't boil. Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the butter until creamy and melted. Then add in the coconut milk curry sugar cilantro and red pepper.
4. Serve  --  Drizzle the sauce over the chicken.  As I mentioned I love to serve this with Jasmine rice and grilled eggplant or zucchini.,

cuisine, Asian >> Indian Subcontinent >> Indian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Place the whole head of garlic in an oiled roasting tin - I used a little pannacotta mould that the garlic could sit snugly in – and drizzle a little olive oil over the garlic. Pop the garlic in a preheated 350F (180C) oven and roast it for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile wash and drain the lentils and then place them in a large heavy-bottomed preferably non-stick pan with the 3 ¾ cups of water. Bring to the boil then reduce heat to a simmer partially covering the pan with its lid. Stirring occasionally allow the lentils to simmer for about 35 minutes or until the mixture starts to take the appearance of very thick soup. You may need to add some water to the pan from time to time as it evaporates and the mixture starts to look dry.
3. Once you have the lentils on to cook melt the ghee or butter in a small to medium skillet and cook the onion fresh chilies and ginger over low heat stirring from time to time until golden – about 10 minutes. Just as the lentils are becoming tender add the onion mixture to the lentils and stir to combine. Then allow the lentils to finish cooking. Give the skillet a bit of a wipe with kitchen paper as you will use it again shortly.
4. At about this time the garlic should be soft and tender. Remove it from the oven and let it cool – roasted garlic can be extremely hot so take care. Cut off the top third of the head and holding the garlic over a small bowl squeeze and otherwise dig out the flesh from each clove. Next mash the garlic with the 2 tablespoons olive oil.
5. Add the roasted garlic puree ground cumin and ground coriander to the lentil mixture and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 10 minutes stirring frequently then add the diced tomatoes and a little lemon juice to taste. Mix thoroughly then reduce the heat while you prepare the spice mix.
6. Heat the oil in the skillet and fry the sliced shallots until quite crispy and brown. Add the garlic and cook until it just colours slightly – overcooked garlic gets bitter. Remove this mixture from the pan and set it aside.
7. Melt the ghee or butter in the same pan and fry the cumin and mustard seeds until the mustard seeds start popping. Stir in the dried chilies curry leaves and the shallot mixture then tip it all into the lentils and swirl it around.
8. Garnish the dhal with the fresh cilantro and serve immediately.,

instructions, 1. Cut the eggplants into 1-inch pieces- preferably keeping at least one side of each piece with the skin on.
2. Put the eggplant pieces into a strainer and sprinkle liberally with salt.  Place a small plate on top of the eggplant and a weight on top of the plate- this process draws the excess water out of the eggplant and it won't be overly salty.  Leave for at least 30 minutes.
3. Heat 1 1/2 tbsp oil in a heavy pan.  When hot add mustard seeds- they will start to pop in a few seconds.  When they begin to pop add the sliced onions garlic and ginger.  Turn the heat to medium and cook until mixture is nicely browned.
4. Add cayenne pepper tumeric garam masala and cumin to the onion mixture.  Cook spices for a few minutes then add water and tomato paste and reduce heat to low.  Let the sauce cook gently but don't allow it to become dry.
5. In a large skillet heat 1 1/2 tbsp oil over moderate heat.  Add eggplant pieces to the pan and arrange in a single layer.  Saute until all sides are brown and crisp.
6. Once all eggplant pieces are browned incorporate them into the sauce pan making sure to cover all pieces with the sauce.  Add lemon juice and salt.
7. Cook gently until eggplant is cooked through (about 15-20 minutes).  Stir occasionally (and very gently) and serve.,

instructions, 1. Cut the chicken into large pieces.  If you must use chicken breasts cut them into 4-6 pieces.  Just keep in mind that by using breasts you're reducing both the fat content (yay!) AND the flavor (boo) and the result will be slightly drier chicken.
2. Chop half of the onions coarsely. Cut the remaining onions into halves lengthwise and then crosswise into very thin slices.
3. Put the chopped onions ginger and garlic into the container of an electric blender. Blend to a paste.
4. Put the oil in a large wide sauté pan or a large deep frying pan (nonstick) and set over medium heat. When hot put in the sliced onions. Stir and fry the onions until they are a deep reddish brown color. Remove the onions with a slotted spoon squeezing out and leaving behind as much of the oil as possible. Put on a plate and set aside.
5. Take the pan off the heat. Put in the paste (keep face averted). Put the pan back onto the heat. Stir and fry the paste until it is brown about 3-4 minutes. Now put in the ground coriander cumin turmeric and cayenne and stir once. Put in 1 Tbsp of the yogurt. Stir for about 30 seconds or until it is incorporated in the sauce. Add all the yogurt this way. Add the chicken pieces and stir them around for a minute.
6. Pour in the water add the tomatoes and salt. Stir to mix and bring to a simmer. Cover turn heat to low and cook for 20 minutes. Sprinkle in the garam masala and the fried onions. Mix. Cook uncovered on medium heat for 7-8 minutes or until the sauce reduces and thickens.
7. Skim off the fat and put the chicken in a warm serving dish. Sprinkle the cilantro or parsley over the top. Nom!,

instructions, 1. Day 1:
2. Measure beer without a head.
3. Mix with remaining ingredients excepting meat and vegetables.
4. Pour marinade over beef in sealable container.
5. Refrigerate overnight.
6. Day 2:
7. If you wish the vegetables can all be prepped the day before and kept in the refrigerator until it's time to assemble to kebabs.
8. Bring large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add halved peppers. Cook for about 10 minutes or until the red peppers begin to lose their skins. Plunge in cold water to stop the cooking. Remove when cool drain well and cut into 3 pieces for each half pepper. Remove skin from 14 red pepper pieces. Set all aside.
9. Dump meat and marinade into a colander over a saucepan. Rinse lightly to remove chunks of marinade. Remove meat and pat dry. Set aside.
10. To the marinade add sauce ingredients (except for beer): oil curry pureed onion garlic and ginger. Bring to a boil boil for 5 minutes. You may skim if you wish I usually don't. Reduce heat and add the beer. Stir well and simmer until reduced to the point where the sauce will stick to the meat and vegetables while cooking.
11. Preheat grill to 300 degrees.
12. Assemble kebabs in whatever order you wish. I do a piece of red pepper with skin onion meat tomato onion meat etc and end up with a piece of tomato skin out.
13. (Putting the pepper and tomato on the ends of the kebabs helps to hold the whole thing together on the grill.).
14. Place loaded skewers on preheated grill turn every 10 minutes or so brushing frequently with the sauce.
15. When the meat is firm and the tomatoes are soft and starting to blacken give the kebabs a good brushing with the sauce and turn the heat to high for a short period of time. This will finish the caramelizing of the glaze and the veggies will be lovely done through and slightly crispy on the outside.
16. Remove from grill serve with anything you want.,

instructions, 1. Filling: Mix the coconut and jaggery together in a vessel and cook slowly on medium heat till the two ingredients are mixed together. Make sure that the mixture retains some of its moisture and does not get overcooked. When the coconut is half cooked add the cardamom roasted poppy seeds and rice flour and continue cooking so that the ingredients are properly mixed together. When the mixture is ready take it off the flame and keep it aside to cool.
2. Dough for the outer covering: Boil 1 cup of water. When it starts boiling add the ghee salt oil and rice flour and stir well. Cover the vessel for a few minutes and allow the mixture to cook for a while stirring occasionally so that no lumps are formed. Once it has assumed a paste-like consistency stir once again and transfer the rice flour paste to a flat bowl. Begin kneading it while it is still hot into a soft dough. You may dip your hands in oil before kneading to prevent the dough from sticking to them. Do not add any more water to the paste while you are kneading it. The dough should be soft but not sticky. Also it should not be too dry. Once the dough is ready divide it into portions and roll each one into a small ball.
3. Modak Preparation: Roll each ball into a circle of approximately 2 inch diameter. Place the circle in your hand and hold it in such a way that it assumes a cup shape.

instructions, 1. Sift the flours together.
2. Rice flour is available in most asian grocery stores.
3. Using all chick-pea flour will make the pakodas a little less crisp.
4. Rub a little salt into the chopped onions.
5. This is to bring out the natural juices from the onions so that we can add less water later.
6. Meanwhile heat oil to about 350 degrees.
7. To the onions add the two flours chili powder grated ginger green chillies baking soda curry leaves and salt to taste.
8. Remove 3 tbsp of the hot oil and add to the mixture.
9. Mix well.
10. The mixture will be slightly dry at this stage.
11. Divide the mixture into several portions.
12. To one portion sprinkle a little water.
13. Mix well.
14. The mixture should just hold together when pressed.
15. Please do not add too much water in which case the product will be like the pakoras that we can find in most Indian restaurants (not a bad thing really).
16. Adding water to individual portions is mainly to keep the baking soda active when the mixture is fried.
17. You can also test for spicyness and salt after frying a small portion and make adjustments to the other portions if needed.
18. Take the mixture and make into small balls or any shape really and drop into the hot oil.
19. Some mixture can also be sort of crumbled into the oil to get crispy bits of fried onion chillies and curry leaves.
20. The key is to make small bits and pieces rather than a few large fritters.
21. Fry until golden brown.
22. The crumbled bits may be done earlier than bigger bites.
23. Drain on paper towels.
24. Repeat for the remaining portions of the raw mixture.
25. Store in an air-tight container.
26. Variations: Finely chopped mint and cilantro can be added to the mixture.
27. Or the quantity of onion can be reduced and whole cashew nuts can be added.,
