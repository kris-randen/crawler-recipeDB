instructions, 1. Cook the pasta in lots of boiling salted water until dente.  Drain and set aside.
2. In a large skillet saute garlic in butter over medium heat for 2 minutes careful not to let the garlic brown or burn.  Add vodka and cook a further minute or so for alcohol to evaporate.

instructions, 1. In a large pot bring 1 gallon of water to a boil.
2. In the second pot bring 1 gallon of water to warm to almost a boil.
3. Place 2 tablespoons salt and as much ice in the third gallon of very cold water in a large bowl.
4. Break up the mozzarella curd into small pieces. Coat the curd with 2 tablespoons of salt and set aside.
5. This is where it gets a little tricky. Carefully pour the boiling water over the salted curd. As the curds begin to melt carefully stir with a wooden spoon when it becomes one transfer it to the pot with the warm water. I wear gloves because the water is hot and needs to be that way to stretch the mozzarella in hot water. The curd will have settled into the bottom of the bowl and at this point you have to work quickly or risk over-cooking the curd. Using the wooden spoon stir and stretch the mozzarella. By stretching the cheese you insure that all the curds have completely melted. The curds will become incredibly soft and have buttery shine and also it smells wonderful. At this point I place the curd in the second bowl of warm water so not to have the cheese get to tough. Form the mozzarella into tomato size balls or larger your prefrence and then drop the mozzarella into the salted ice water to stop the cooking process. Work quickly as the mozzarella will start to become rubbery the longer it sits in the hot water.
6. Wrap each mozzarella ball tightly in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to a week. If it doesn`t get eaten before that.

instructions, 1. Using a fork combine the butter ingredients. Divide the seasoned butter into 8 equal portions.
2. Prepare the grill for indirect and direct cooking over medium-high heat.
3. Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Using your fingertips gently loosen the skin of the thighs being careful not to completely separate the skin from the meat. Lift skin up and place a portion of butter underneath. Smooth the skin over the butter and massage it gently to spread it evenly over the top of the meat. Season thighs on both sides with salt and pepper.
4. Grill thighs skin side up first over indirect medium-high heat with the lid closed until sizzling slightly firm and lightly marked on the bottom 18 to 20 minutes. Then turn the thighs over and cook over direct medium-high heat with the lid closed until the juices run clear the skin is blistered and crisp and the meat is no longer pink at the bone 2 to 4 minutes more. If flare-ups occur (and they did frequently for me) move the thighs temporarily over indirect heat. Remove from grill and let rest for 3 to 5 minutes. Serve warm.,

Place another dish on top and lightly weight it for instance using a full can of tomatoes. Keep the eggplant in the press for at least two hours.  This process will drain out the acidic liquid which causes the eggplant to taste bitter and act like a sponge when frying.
2. After the time has elapsed rinse or wipe off the slices and pat dry.  Heat 2 inches of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat until hot.  Dust each slice with flor before frying.  Cook to a rich golden brown and drain between brown paper until everything else is ready for assembly.
3. While frying eggplant begin the tomato sauce.  Pass the can of tomatoes through a food mill to remove any seeds.  Place the 1/4 cup of olive oil in a sauce pan and saute the whole garlic until brown remove the garlic.  Add the tomatoes paste sugar basil and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Stir well and cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile continue to cook eggplant and keep hot uncovered in a 300' oven.  At this time cook your pasta when it's done toss in a warm serving bowl with some of the sauce and half of the cheese.  Arrange eggplant on top.  Drizzle with sauce and sprinkle with cheese.

7. Continue stirring the clam and garlic mixture being careful to not let the garlic burn.
8. Add chopped herbs to the clam/garlic mixture and saute for another two minutes.  Remove from heat.
9. When pasta is done to "al dente" remove from heat and drain water.
10. Put pasta into a large bowl and add clam/garlic/herb mixture.  Mix well to prevent the pasta from sticking.  Serve immediately.

12. This sauce is highly flexible and can be modified in any number of ways.  I always recommend using angel hair pasta though as it soaks up the flavors better than any other type of pasta.,

instructions, 1. Put large stock pot of water on to boil with 2 tablespoons salt.  When water boils add 3 regular pkg. of linguini noodles and boil until done but still firm.  Noodles can be boiling while you are making your sauce.  In another large stock pot melt 1 stick of real salted butter and 1 stick of Blue Bonnet Margarine.  Add about 3 teaspoons of granulated garlic about 1 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoons Italian seasoning 1 teaspoons parsley and 1 teaspoons black pepper. Boil for a couple minutes.  Add 2 pkgs. Of uncooked frozen shrimp without tails.  Cook about 7 minutes on high temperature  Remove shrimp with slotted spoon and set aside on plate.  To the remaining liquid butter add 1 heaping tablespoons of all purpose flour.  It will thicken immediately so stir quickly.  Keep on burned for a bit stirring briskly with slotted spoon or whisk until all lumps are gone.  Remove from burner to prevent burning and stir.   This rue is very thick right now.  To the thickened rue add about 2 more teaspoons salt 4 chopped green onions with most of stem 2 pints of heavy cream 2 tablespoons parsley flakes 1 cup of parmesan cheese and 1 tablespoons of granulated garlic. Stir and cook on high heat for about 7 minutes.  Add about 3 cups of milk another stick of Margarine and the shrimp.  Stir and cook over high heat stirring very often for about 10 minutes.  Add 2 cans of minced crab without the juice and another 1 ½ cups parmesan cheese.  Boil and stir for another 7 minutes or so. While it’s boiling  In a small bowl put 1 heaping tablespoons flour.  Using a regular soup dipper add 1 dipper of boiling sauce to flour.  Stir flour mixture with whisk until no big lumps remain.  Add one more dipper of boiling sauce to flour mixture and stir again until mixed.  This will still have small lumps.  Into boiling Sauce add the flour mixture slowly about 1 tablespoons at a time while stirring constantly.  Let sauce boil while stirring constantly for another 7 minutes or so and remove from heat.  Sprinkle each portion with Grated Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately with French Bread slices grilled in garlic butter!  A salad also goes nicely with this meal.  This Alfredo Sauce should not be really thick like gravy. It is very flavorful and not that expensive to make.  The sauce will thicken a little more as it starts to cool down.  Great for left-overs!  Kids love this even with the green onions!  Don’t tell them the onions are there and they will think the green stuff is parsley!,

Also: If you like to give the presentation a little added elegance for a special occasion just serve on a bed of green leaf lettuce or fresh parsley and top with thin lemon slices.  Because we "eat with our eye's" first it makes the dish an instant hit that just gets better with each bite.,

cuisine, European >> Italian >> Italian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. This soup uses kale but you can use any of the major greens you like. I have alternated in kale escarole and it has been reviewed with others using spinach. As the first review of this recipe indicates using multiple pots can be a pain. However the only reason to use two pots is if you are actually using kale. Other greens that are softer don't require blanching and as a result you can get away with using just one pot.
2. Using two pans the soup pot and a regular 12 inch sauté pan:
3. Step 1.
4. In the soup pot:
5. Rinse the kale well chopping off heavy stems.
6. While the kale is wet just add to soup pot and add about a quarter cup of water. Blanch the kale leaves in pot reserve liquid and leave in soup pot for now.
7. Step 2.
8. In the sauté pan.
9. Skin the sausage split lengthwise while raw with knife and cut into bite sized pieces so they look like small meatballs.
10. Lightly brown the sausage (do not cook through) drain and set as aside.
11. Make sure when cooking that you don’t burn the sausage as you will be cooking with the sausage grease next.
12. Pour out any grease that will easily drip out but leave a fine coat of the sausage grease on the pan for your next step and set pan aside for now.
13. If you burn chunks of sausage to the pan just use a paper towel to wipe out any black crust but leave some of the fat there.
14. Step 3.
15. Once the sausage is set aside take the large pieces of kale and chop into bite sized pieces. Return to the soup pot keeping any liquid in the pot.
16. Add broth and tomatoes to the pot with the kale and begin to heat on high.
17. Step 4.
18. Sauté onion garlic and jalapeño pepper into the slightly greasy pan with the 2 table spoons of butter.
19. When onions are slightly translucent or about 3 minutes add spices to this mixture.
20. Step 5.
21. Add the sauté pan contents to the soup pot and add the sausage to the soup pot. Bring the entire mixture to a boil. After boiling for about 2 minutes reduce heat to a medium low heat and simmer for about 1.5 hours.
22. Optional:
23. Option 1:
24. If you like add 1 cup of rice to this and at 8 ounces of water while cooking. Suggest you add the rice to the sauté pan and sauté with the onion mix for about 3 minutes before putting into the main soup pot.
25. Option 2:
26. After soup has simmered for about half an hour alone add a package of noodles of your choice and the 8 ounces of water.
27. Option 3:
28. Add 3 Medium potatoes chopped into small pieces while raw sauté with onions until the potato cubes are soft to the touch. Add to soup pot.
29. Add 3 Medium potatoes chopped into small pieces while raw sauté with onions until the potato cubes are soft to the touch. Add to soup pot.,

5. Simmer on low for at least an hour. Then add the cheeses and the heavy cream.  Stir well until the cream and cheeses are well blended into the sauce. Stir occasionally while the tortellini is cooking to prevent the sauce from sticking and to prevent the cream from scorching.
6. Bring water to a boil in another pot for the tortellini.  Add a little olive oil to prevent the tortellini from sticking.  Once the water comes to a boil add the tortellini. Cook according to the package directions.
7. I usually reserve some of the sauce for spaghetti for another day -- I add some sauteed mushrooms then.  I try to ration the sauce to the amount of tortellini.  If you like lots of sauce use all the sauce.  But if not save some for another pasta dish.  It freezes well.  At my house it never lasts long enough to freeze!,

2. In a small bowl whisk together the 2T lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. Place arugula leaves into a large bowl and dress it with the lemon vinaigrette. Toss to mix well. Set aside. [I know it may seem like a lot of arugula at this point but it will wilt down during the cooking process.].
3. Roll out pizza dough according to your recipe or store bought instructions. Once the grill is hot (you can hold your hands an inch over the grates for no more than 2 or 3seconds) carefully place the pizza dough onto the grill. Grill for about two minutes on one side. The pizza dough will also immediately puff up. Flip the pizza dough onto the other side and grill for another two minutes. Remove from grill onto a cookie sheet with tongs. Close the lid of the grill to retain its heat. [If you are using a ready-made pizza crust cook it for two minutes on each side to get the grill marks and flavor.].
4. Place slices of smoked mozzarella around top of the pizza crust. And then in this order spread all of the arugula leaves around layer with prosciutto slices and top with crumbled goat cheese.
5. Place the cookie sheet onto the grill and close the lid. [This allows for the toppings to cook without burning the pizza crust.] Cook for about five minutes or until the cheese has melted the arugula has wilted and the prosciutto has crisped up a little. Carefully remove the cookie sheet from the grill. Using tongs slide pizza onto a cutting board. Using a sharp knife or pizza slicer slice the pizza and enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Gently heat milk in a small saucepan just until barely simmering. Remove and keep covered.
2. In a separate saucepan melt butter. When foam subsides add flour and stir until smooth. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes stirring. Do not allow flour to color. Gradually add the warm milk whisking to combine. Add the salt and cayenne and increase the heat to medium. Cook the mixture whisking continuously until the sauce comes to a boil and is thickened. Remove from heat and add 10 of the roasted garlic cloves. Pour the hot mixture into a blender cover tightly and process until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl and cool slightly placing a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface.
3. Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500 degrees F.
4. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of the yellow cornmeal on a baker's peel or baking sheet. Place the rolled out pizza dough circle on the prepared baker's peel or baking sheet.
5. Spread the cooled sauce over pizza dough leaving a 3/4-inch border. Place sliced mozzarella on top of the sauce. Sprinkle the remaining roasted garlic cloves (whole) over the cheese and top with the grated fontina. Bake the pizza for 8 to 10 minutes or until the crust is golden and cheese is melted and bubbly and golden brown in spots. Remove from the oven and sprinkle chopped herbs over the top. Serve immediately.
6. Roasted Garlic:
7. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
8. Place the garlic on a foil-lined baking sheet and rub 1 teaspoon of oil into the top of each head. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and place cut side down on the baking sheet. Bake until the cloves are soft and golden about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle. Carefully remove each clove of garlic from the head. Squeeze each head of garlic to expel any cloves that you cannot remove individually. Set aside until needed.
9. Parmesan Pizza Dough:
10. In a large bowl combine the water yeast honey and 1 tablespoon oil stirring to combine. Let sit until the mixture is foamy about 5 minutes.
11. Add 1 1/2 cups of the flour and the salt mixing by hand until it is all incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Continue adding the flour 1/4 cup at a time working the dough after each addition until the dough is smooth but still slightly sticky. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth but still slightly tacky 3 to 5 minutes.
12. Oil a large mixing bowl with remaining olive oil. Place the dough in the bowl turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place free from drafts until doubled in size about 1 1/2 hours.
13. Punch dough down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 15-inch circle.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. Sprinkle a little bit of the vinegar on the fish filets rinse them and pat them dry on a paper towel.
3. Rub a little bit of salt into the filets.
4. Place the fish into an oven safe casserole dish.
5. On one side sprinkle the filets with half of the lemon juice and then coat them with half of the bread crumbs.
6. Note if you need more than 1/3 of a cup of bread crumbs use them it's up to your taste.  I also used italian bread crumbs and they were very tasty.
7. Drizzle the filets with olive oil.  Make sure that all of the bread crumbs are coated in olive oil even if you need to use more than the suggested amount so that it crisps up nicely.
8. Turn the filets over and repeat steps 5-7 with the remaining olive oil lemon juice and bread crumbs.
9. Cover the fish and marinade at room temperature for 30 minutes.
10. While the fish marinades make the sauce by adding the thyme lemon juice mustard and salt to taste to a food processor and pulse for 1 minute.
11. Add the butter and process until smooth.
12. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil until the sauce fully incorperates into a smooth mayonnaise like consistency.
13. After the fish has marinaded place the casserole dish uncovered in the 400 degree oven.  Again cooking times may vary depending on what type of fish you use.  I cooked the 6 oz 1-1 1/2 in thick salmon filets that I used for 13 minutes on each side and then broiled them on one side for 2 minutes to give the crust some color.  You could also grill the fish if you prefer.
14. Serve the fish with the sauce drizzled over them.
15. Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. 1. Add hot water (1 1/2 cup plus 1 Tbs) sugar and yeast to your bread maker pan.
2. 2. Add the three types of flours.  Remember: it's the Semolina that makes this recipe unique.
3. 3. Add the salt.
4. 4. Process in the bread maker on the “Dough” setting including the rising time or process as you would by hand allowing the dough to triple.
5. When finished the dough will be easy to work and slightly sticky.  Rub your hands with olive oil so the dough doesn’t stick.  For my use I divide the finished dough into 4 pieces.  Use olive oil to season 4 9 inches cake pans and press the dough into each pan.  Brush additional olive oil onto the top of each then cover the pans and let the dough raise again for about a half hour.  You can also divide into two 13 inches crusts or one 16+ inches.
6. Next prick the dough with a fork to prevent air bubbles then par-bake the crusts for 5 minutes in a 425 degree oven.  Place the cooked crusts on a rack and when cool wrap with foil and freeze for use whenever you want a great pizza or let cool and make them right away!  I've tried these not par-baking first but it seems par-baking makes the better "lite crunch" on the outside of the crust.
7. When making a pizza from a frozen crust thaw the crust first (in the microwave for 12 seconds on high).  Place the crust back into the pan which has again been seasoned with olive oil and also brush the top of the crust again.  If you use a pizza screen brush top and bottom.  Apply the toppings of your choice and bake for 12-15 minutes at 425 degrees (less time if using a screen).  You’ll have a finished pizza that has a light crunch on the outside and a delightfully chewy texture.  When checking cooking time look for a golden brown edge on the crust.,

instructions, 1. Put a large pan of salted water on to boil for the pasta.  Cut the pancetta into 1/2 X 1/4 inch cubes.  If the pancetta has its rind on cut it off - and use a bigger piece of pancetta as the amount I've specified is for prepared cubes - and put the rind in a pan with a film of oil and cook it gently to render down.
2. Then in a large pan that will fit the pasta later cook the pancetta cubes in the oil until crispy but not crunchy.  Chuck over them the white whine or vermouth and let it bubble away so that after a few minutes you have a small amount of salty winey syrup left.  Take the pan off the heat.
3. In a bowl beat together the eggs Parmesan cream and some pepper.  Cook the pasta more or less according to the package instructions but since you want it kept al dente start checking it at 2 minutes before the package says its done.  Lower in a cup and remove approximately 1/2 cup of the pasta water before draining.  Put the other pan the one with the bacon cubes on the heat and add the drained pasta tossing well to coat with the syrupy pancetta.  Add a little of the reserved pasta water to lubricate if necessary.  Take the pan off the heat again and add the eggs and cheese mixture swiftly tossing everything in to the mix.  Grind over some more pepper and grate over the nutmeg carry producing aloft and dive inches.

cuisine, European >> Italian >> Italian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. set your oven to 350 degrees.
2. depending on how much you love basil measure out 1/2 min to 3/4 cup max of fresh basil leaves (stems picked off). then finely dice the leaves and set to the side.
3. grab your FRESH sun dried tomatoes and start to thinly slice (julienne) these. i prepared about 6 large ones (about the size of a half dollar) to later add to the mixture. you can certainly add more if you love the flavor however i decided instead to add a small row of the julienned tomatoes during the rolling process which turned out nicely. (see *NOTE* during rolling process).
4. grab a mixing bowl and combine the following w a hand mixer. goat cheese (entire 8oz log) pesto (all 7oz) diced basil julienned sun dried tomatoes. once you've thoroughly mixed the filling you can move over to prep the chicken breast.
5. remove the chicken from the packaging and wash off in the sink. remove any excess fat and funkys to "clean up" your chicken.
6. take about 2 tsp of the goat cheese mixture and spread along the chicken evenly. then roll the chicken up and secure with 1 or 2 toothpicks. set to the side. complete process til you have no mixture left. (this is why i say get 2 packs of the chicken i make more one day and less another just depends on how thick the chicken is how long it is --  everything varies).
7. *NOTE* this is where the sun dried tomato lovers stepped in and had a line of julienned tomatoes added to their roll. i simply sliced 1 tomato per breast of chicken and added the line close to the beginning of the rolling (if you roll side A to side B place the tomatoes close to side A so that they are in the center of the roll up) it really added a nice burst of flavor to these rolls and i would recommend at least trying this in one roll to see if you care for it.
8. once your done rolling you can start to bread them. prepare 3 bowls:  flour;  egg whites;  bread crumbs & parmesan cheese mixed together.
9. prepare baking sheet:  i lined a sheet with tin foil and sprayed it lightly with olive oil Pam to prevent sticking and make for easy clean-up.
10. dunk each roll into the flour then egg then bread crumb mixture and coat evenly with each step. set completed rolls onto the baking sheet and be sure that none are touching.
11. bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes.  (i did 40 but will try for 35 next time i had a thick piece i was concerned with cooking through).
12. check to see that they are a nice golden brown and juices are running clear.
13. REMOVE TOOTHPICKS BEFORE SERVING.
14. served 2 pieces per person. makes 10- 12 rolls.
15. ps- im considering topping with Carrabba's Lemon Butter Sauce next time :) be sure to look up the recipe! its on here!  http://www.recipezaar.com/recipe/Carrabbas-Lemon-Butter-Sauce-119582      be sure to read the reviews and reduce the lemon if you dont want it to over power the sauce --  i reduce i want a creamy lemon garlic flavor not a lemon garlic dressing.,

instructions, 1. Pour a very thin coat of olive oil over the bottom of a large sauté pan and place over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot add the onions carrots and celery and sauté stirring often until shiny and crisp-tender about 4 minutes. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper while cooking. Add the sausage to the pan breaking apart the crumbles and brown well.
2. Pour in the wine and keep at a brisk simmer until the wine has all but evaporated. Mix together the beef and chicken stock and pour 1 1/2 cups into the pan.  Continue to simmer uncovered until stock is nearly gone (about 12-14 minutes). Stir occasionally. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
3. Stir in the chopped mushrooms and the remaining 1/2 cup stock mixture. Continue simmering another 10 minutes.  Pour over the Half & Half and fold to mix then turn off heat and cover.
4. When the pasta water is at a full boil add penne and cook until al dente. When the pasta is almost done scoop out a half cup of the cooking water.  Drain the pasta and place it back in the pot. Pour the sauce on top and add the parsley and most of the grated cheese (reserve some for garnish).
5. Fold in the sauce with a wooden spoon--it should not be dry rather a silky sauce should coat the pasta evenly. Add a little pasta water if too thick. Serve hot with grated parmesan on top.,

6. If you run out of egg or bread crumb mixture just make a little more.

instructions, 1. BIGA: Mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon for 2 to 3 minutes until a smooth somewhat elastic batter has formed.
2. The batter will be very stiff; it gets softer and more elastic after it has proofed.
3. You may find it easier to mix the sponge using electric mixer with a paddle or a dough hook on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes.
4. Scrape the sponge into a 2-quart clear plastic container and cover with plastic wrap.
5. At this point you have two options: If you plan to make your dough later that same day let the sponge rest at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to collapse.
6. This may take from 6 to 8 hours depending on the temperature of the sponge the temperature of the room and the strength of the yeast.
7. The sponge will triple in volume and small dents and folds will begin to appear in the top as it reaches its peak and then begins to deflate.
8. The sponge is now in perfect condition to be used in a dough.
9. It's best if you have already weighed or measured out all of your other recipe ingredients before the sponge reaches this point so you can use it before it collapses too much.
10. If you're not planning to make your dough until the next day or the day after put the covered sponge in the refrigerator and let it rise there for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use in a recipe.
11. Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water (85 to 90 degrees) in the dough instead of the cool water specified in the recipe.
12. Or let the starter sit out covered until it reaches room temperature (this may take several hours)-but don't let it collapse to much before you use it.
13. BREAD: Combine the warm water and yeast in a large bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast.
14. Let stand for 3 minutes.
15. Add the cool water and biga to the yeast mixture and mix with your fingers for about 2 minutes breaking up the biga.
16. The mixture should look milky and slightly foamy.
17. Add the flour and salt and mix with your fingers to incorporate the flour scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the ingredients together until the dough gathers into a mass.
18. It will be wet and sticky with long strands of dough hanging from your fingers.
19. If the dough is not sticky add 1 tablespoon of water.
20. Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes until it becomes supple and fairly smooth.
21. This is a sticky wet dough; don't be tempted to add more flour to the work surface.
22. Just dust lightly and use a dough scraper as necessary to loosen the dough from the table during kneading.
23. Allow the dough to rest for 15 minutes covered with oiled plastic wrap (This rest period is the autolyse.) Knead the dough 3 to 5 minutes until it is stretchy and smooth yet still slightly sticky.
24. Shape the dough into a loose ball place it in a lightly oiled bowl and turn the dough in the bowl to coat with oil.
25. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) for about 1 hour or until the dough looks slightly puffy but has not doubled.
26. Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or preferably overnight to let it relax develop flavor and become more manageable.
27. Take the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours until it begins to warm up and starts to rise.
28. Flour a work surface well and gently dump the dough onto it.
29. Divide the dough into three equal pieces about 13 ounces each.
30. Gently flatten one piece pressing out some of the air bubbles and stretch it into a rectangle.
31. Fold the top third down and the bottom third up as if you were folding a business letter.
32. Now form the loaf into a short baguette by rolling the dough over from left to right and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm.
33. Fold the dough over about 1/ 3 of the way each time seal the length of the loaf then repeat.
34. You want to gently draw the skin tight over the surface of the loaf while leaving some air bubbles in the dough.
35. Seal the seam being careful not to tear the skin of the dough or deflate its airy structure.
36. Do not elongate.
37. These loaves are about 10 inches long.
38. Cover an area on the work surface with a thick layer of flour and place the loaf seam side down on the flour.
39. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough.
40. The loaves will be loose and slightly irregular in shape.
41. Leave plenty of space between the loaves they will spread as they rise.
42. Cover the loaves with well oiled plastic and let them rise for 1 to 2 hours until bubbly and loose.
43. Thirty minutes before baking preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.
44. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack just below the stone.
45. Sprinkle a peel very generously with cornmeal.
46. Line an upside-down baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle very generously with cornmeal.
47. Lift one loaf flip it over so the floured side is on top and gently tug on the ends to stretch the loaf to the full length of the peel or about 14 inches on a pan.
48. Repeat with the remaining loaves placing 2 on the peel and 1 on the pan.
49. Dimple each loaf with your finger in about 6 places but don't deflate them too much.
50. Be sure the loaves are loosened from the peel then carefully slide them onto the baking stone.
51. Place the pan of bread on the rack below the stone.
52. Using a plant sprayer quickly mist the loaves with water 8 to 10 times then quickly shut oven door.
53. Mist the loaves again after 1 minute.
54. Then mist again 1 minute later.
55. Bake for about 10 minutes then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees and bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaves sound slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown.
56. (If the crust is not brown enough the loaves will soften as they cool.) Transfer the bread to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.,

instructions, 1. For assembly:
2. one 8-inch cardboard round.
3. one 6-inch cardboard round
4. three 8-inch plastic straws
5. Make cake layers:.
6. Preheat oven to 350°F and line 2 buttered 7- by 2-inch round cake pans and 2 buttered 9- by 2-inch round cake pans with rounds of wax paper. Butter paper and dust pans with flour knocking out excess.
7. Put cocoa powder in a bowl and whisk in boiling water in a stream until smooth. Stir in chopped chocolate and let stand 5 minutes. Stir mixture until smooth and chocolate is melted and cool mixture. Whisk in sour cream and vanilla.
8. Into a bowl sift together flour baking soda and salt. In large bowl of a standing electric mixer beat together butter and sugars until light and fluffy and add eggs 1 at a time beating well after each addition and scraping down side of bowl. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture and cocoa mixture alternately in batches beginning and ending with flour mixture and beating until batter is combined well.
9. Pour 2 cups batter into each 7-inch pan and smooth tops. Divide remaining batter between 9-inch pans (about 33/4 cups each) and smooth tops. In middle and lower thirds of oven arrange one 9-inch layer and one 7-inch layer on each rack putting 7-inch layers in front part of oven. Bake 7-inch layers 25 to 30 minutes and 9-inch layers 35 to 40 minutes or until a tester comes out with crumbs adhering. Run a thin knife around edges of pans and invert cakes onto racks. Peel off paper and cool cakes completely. Cake layers may be made 2 days ahead and kept at cool room temperature wrapped well in plastic wrap or 2 weeks ahead and frozen wrapped well in plastic wrap and foil. Defrost cake layers (without unwrapping) at room temperature.
10. Make ganache:.
11. In a small saucepan bring cream just to a boil. Remove pan from heat and add chocolate butter zest and liqueur. Let ganache stand 3 minutes and whisk until chocolate is melted. Chill ganache just until cool about 40 minutes.
12. In a bowl with an electric mixer beat ganache just until light and fluffy before using (do not overbeat or it will become grainy).
13. Assemble cake:.
14. Put one 9-inch layer on 8-inch cardboard round and spread evenly with 2 cups ganache. Top with remaining 9-inch layer and gently press layers together to form an even tier. Put one 7-inch layer on 6-inch cardboard round and top with remaining ganache and remaining 7-inch layer in same manner.
15. Frost top and sides of 9-inch tier with some buttercream and chill while frosting 7-inch tier. Chill both tiers until buttercream is firm.
16. Cut straws in half and insert 1 straw piece all the way into center of 9-inch tier. Trim straw flush with top of tier and insert remaining 5 straw pieces in same manner in a circle about 1 1/2 inches from center straw. Center 7-inch tier (still on cardboard) on top of 9-inch tier. Fill in any gaps between tiers with buttercream and transfer cake to a cake stand or platter. Chill cake at least 6 hours and up to 1 day.
17. Arrange fraises des bois and roses decoratively on top and around sides of cake. Let cake stand at cool room temperature (buttercream is sensitive to warm temperatures) 2 to 4 hours before serving. Serves about 30 (including top tier).
18. Make orange curd:.
19. In a small heavy saucepan whisk together yolks and sugar and whisk in orange juice butter and a pinch salt. Cook mixture over moderately low heat whisking until it just reaches boiling point 5 to 7 minutes (do not let boil) and strain through a fine sieve into a bowl. Whisk in lemon juice and cool curd its surface covered with plastic wrap. Chill orange curd covered until cold at least 4 hours and up to 2 days.
20. Make buttercream:.
21. In a heavy saucepan bring sugar and water to a boil stirring until sugar is dissolved. Boil syrup undisturbed until it registers 248°F on a candy thermometer. While syrup is boiling in large bowl of a standing electric mixer beat whites with a pinch salt until foamy and beat in cream of tartar. Beat whites until they just hold stiff peaks and beat in hot syrup in a stream (try to avoid beaters and side of bowl). Beat mixture at medium speed until completely cool 15 to 20 minutes. Beat in butter 1 piece at a time and beat until thickened and smooth. (Buttercream will at first appear very thin and at some point look like it is breaking but as more butter is beaten in it will thicken and become glossy and smooth.) Beat in orange curd salt and zest until smooth. Buttercream may be made 4 days ahead and chilled in an airtight container or 2 weeks ahead and frozen in an airtight container. Bring buttercream completely to room temperature (this may take several hours if frozen) and beat before using. (If buttercream is too cold when beaten it will not be glossy and smooth.) Makes about 8 cups.
22. Note: A cake-decorating turntable is extremely helpful for assembling and decorating a wedding cake.
23. Decoration: fraises des bois (wild strawberries) and small roses with some leaves attached (both fruit and flowers must be nontoxic and pesticide-free).,

instructions, 1. Sauté the Walla Walla Onions lightly with the crushed garlic in the olive oil. Add the Italian Sausage to be lightly browned with onions and garlic; when the Italian sausage is pierced with a fork the fat will run out then add the ground Bison and ground pork until well browned in a large pot.
2. Add 1 cup of red wine and the crushed tomatoes whole tomatoes tomato paste and sun dried tomatoes to pot.
3. Add Cinnamon sticks Cinnamon Cumin Demerara Sugar Parsley Oregano Basil Thyme Rosemary Herbs DE Provence Chili Peppers Sea Salt and Pepper. Stirring constantlybring to a brisk simmer add ½ of the 2 tablespoons of butter.
4. Simmer all day adding about a cup of water or wine your choice. When the sauce goes down about an inch; be careful as the sugar and the wine will tend to caramelize and burn on the bottom of your pan if not carefully watched and stirred throughout the day. After about 6 hours there should be a very nice glossy sheen to the sauce.
5. After taking off stove cool before refrigerating  overnight can be left out on your stove or counter to cool.In the morning skim off the fat that has risen and solidified on the top of the sauce and discard.
6. Put back on the stove a low simmer for 4 hours or until there is a thickening of the sauce with a glossy sheen; the tomato sauce will look paler and have a light sweet hot taste.
7. Sauté the mushrooms lightly and add to sauce or add to each individual plate when serving spaghetti to taste.

Once your sauce starts to bubble add the Parmesan cheese rind (or fresh Parmesan) and the can of tomato paste. Stir well to incorporate the cheese and reduce heat to lowest burner setting.
3. Simmer the sauce for 3 hours stirring frequently to prevent burning. (I simmer mine total for at least 6-8 hours.).
4. After 3 hours taste sauce again and adjust the seasonings/herbs.
5. Simmer the sauce for another hour. Using an immersion blender whir the sauce until the pieces of tomato carrots onions and celery are blended and as smooth as you can get.
6. If you don’t have an immersion blender you can use a normal blender but only blend 2-3 cups at a time and remove the center of the lid and place a folded kitchen towel over the opening to allow steam to escape without burning your hand. Hot liquids will cause the cover to blow off and you’ll have a tomato-decorated kitchen and burned hands.
7. Blend the sauce until it’s smooth.
8. If you used a Parmesan cheese rind the immersion blender will whir that into very small pieces and after it’s cooked in the sauce for several hours those little cheesy bits taste heavenly in the finished sauce.
9. You may need to add a little more water once you return the blended sauce back to the sauce pot. The water will cook out; so don’t worry if you add too much you can cook it to your desired consistency. I prefer mine a little loose because it thickens up in the fridge.
10. Once you’ve achieved the seasoning level you desire (this is the point where you would add cooked homemade meatballs) continue to simmer for another 4-6 hours stirring frequently and taking care to not let any sauce burn on the bottom of the pan.
11. Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool down as much as possible. Cover and refrigerate overnight. If you simply can’t wait a day while your sauce does magical things as it chills in the fridge go ahead and serve it over some pasta.
12. Notes.
13. Seasoning: Each time you add an element; it is best to taste it for seasoning. Let it simmer/cook for a few minutes stir well taste and then adjust seasonings. You may find you want to add a little more garlic or another teaspoon of an herb.
14. Parmesan Cheese Rinds: I use the rinds to flavor soups and sauces. If you don’t happen to have a spare rind sitting around run to the store and buy a hunk of good Parmesan (please don’t come home with that green canister of grated Parmesan) and toss in 1-2 ounces of Parmesan either grated or cut into small chunks.
15. Acidic Sauce: If your sauce seems very acidic add a TB of good olive oil or butter and a ¼ to ½ teaspoons of baking soda and stir well. You can also add a teaspoon of sugar if you find your tomatoes are very acidic. The baking soda makes it more alkaline and the sugar cuts the acidity by making it a bit sweeter. Baking soda will cause your sauce to bubble for a bit so make sure you start with a very low amount and taste after each addition.
16. The sauce tastes much better after spending at least 12 hours in the chill chest (fridge)–I try to give it a good 24-36 hours in the fridge before using it for spaghetti or lasagna or shells.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. Trim the pork tenderloin of any excess fat. Use a mortar and pestle to crush the peppercorns marjoram  rosemary and garlic powder together. Sprinkle the spices around the meat and wrap in plastic wrap.  Set aside for up to 15 minutes. (If you are going to let this rest longer place in fridge and remove 15 minutes before cooking.).
3. To roast plums place the fruit skin side to the bottom of the pan and leaves from 2 rosemary sprigs in an 8-inch-square baking dish.
4. Whisk water balsamic vinegar 4 tablespoons sugar and peppercorns in a small bowl until the sugar dissolves. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean; add the seeds and bean to the vinegar mixture. Pour the mixture over the plums. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons (turbinado or white) sugar.
5. Roast the plums uncovered until tender and beginning to break down 20 to 25 minutes.
6. Once the meat has sat for 15 minutes heat olive oil in a cast iron skillet (or another oven proof pan). Cook the meat for 5-6 minutes turning so that all sides of the tenderloin are browned.  Place skillet in the oven and cook until the meat reaches 155 degrees about 12-15 minutes. Once done remove the pork from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes.  (In that time the meat will reach the desired 160 degrees.).
7. Once the plums are done roasting discard the rosemary and the vanilla bean. Strain the roasting liquid into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook until reduced to 1/2 cup 6 to 8 minutes. Whilst reducing the sauce tent the plums with foil over the roasting pan. (I would suggest not starting your reduction until the meat is cooked and resting.).
8. After the meat has rested carve on the diagonal into slices about 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick.
9. To serve place a quarter of plums onto the plate. Place the pork on top and drizzle with the balsamic reduction. Garnish with additional rosemary if desired.,

3. 1/2 cup steel-cut oats sometimes called Irish or Scotch oats (3 1/4 ounces).
4. 3/4 cup water.
5. Pinch active dry yeast.
6. Dough:
7. 2 1//4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour plus additional as needed (9 7/8 ounces).
8. 3/4 cup whole wheat flour (3 1/2 ounce).
9. 1/2 cup oat flour (1 3/4 ounce).
10. 1/4 cup flaxseed meal (1 ounce).
11. 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1/4 ounce package).
12. 2 teaspoons fine salt (3/4 ounce).
13. 1 3/4 cups warm water (about 110 degrees F).
14. 1&#8260;4 cup extra-virgin olive oil.
15. Cooking spray.
16. Toppings:
17. 6 cloves garlic roughly chopped.
18. 2 sprigs fresh thyme leaves chopped (about 2 teaspoons).
19. 1 sprig fresh rosemary chopped (about 2 teaspoons).
20. 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil.
21. 1 tablespoon medium-coarse sea salt.
22. 3 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano shaved into large pieces.
23. Equipment: 2 pans either jelly roll 1/4 sheet or 9-inch square metal.
24. To make the poolish: Whisk the whole wheat flour steel-cut oats water and yeast in medium bowl. Cover with plastic and set aside at room temperature for 12 hours or overnight.
25. To make the dough: Whisk the all-purpose whole wheat and oat flour flaxseed yeast and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the poolish water and olive oil. Stir the wet ingredients into the flour with a wooden spoon to make a very sticky loose dough. Cover with a kitchen towel and let stand for 30 minutes.

Using a bench scraper fold the dough as you would a business letter. (The dough is very wet and this may seem odd but just move quickly with the scraper and fold 1 end of the dough over the other. Make sure you brush any raw flour from the surface of the dough before you fold over the second end). Spray with cooking spray and cover with a kitchen towel. Let stand 30 minutes.
27. Fold the dough again like a letter and rest for another 30 minutes.
28. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Divide the olive oil among 2 pans and swirl to coat the pan. Divide dough in half and transfer a piece to each pan turn dough over to coat both sides with oil then press dough evenly into the pans. Scatter the garlic thyme and rosemary over the top and press the toppings into the dough with your fingers. Sprinkle with sea salt and scatter the cheese on top. (See Cook's Note.).
29. Bake until golden brown about 20 to 25 minutes. Slip focaccia from the pans and cool on a rack.
30. Cooks' Note: The focaccia dough can be tightly wrapped and refrigerated at this point for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature for about 2 hours before baking.,

2. Mix salt pepper garlic powder and grated cheese into the flour.  Beat egg into water to make an egg wash.  Set up a standard 3 stage dipping station for frying the eggplant Hand dip in the seasoned flour then into the egg wash and finally coat well in the breadcrumbs.
3. Start the pasta boiling in a separate pot while you start heating oil in a skillet to pan fry the eggplant.  Add a dash of olive oil or butter to the spaghetti water to keep it from boiling over.  The pasta can be just lightly cooked to al-dente stage as it will finish off in the oven.
4. Pan fry the eggplant about 5 minutes on each side until nice and golden and drain on a plate.
5. Drain the spaghetti and toss in a bowl with some olive oil.  Also start the oven to preheat at 350 at this time.
6. Get out a 3 x 9 x 12 inch casserole dish and spread a little marinara sauce to coat the bottom.  Now add all the pasta in a layer and then layer on the rest of the sauce.  Add the breaded eggplant slices in a layer on top of the sauce and finally top with fresh shredded Parmesan cheese.
7. Place in the oven to bake for 20 minutes or until the cheese is nice and bubbly on top.  Let it stand and cool for a couple minutes serve and enjoy.,

14. Spray pan I have used the 9x12 but then the pasta curls out on edges and u have to cut back on the cheeses & sauce…usually a pan used for lasagna maybe 14’…pasta will look strange because they are dry but will expand and absorb the juices…bake 350 degrees foil top approx 45 min…please check and make sure foil is loose so as no cheese sticks when removed.
15. REMOVE WITH CARE…ITS PRETTY HEAVY! -- but ‘dee-lish-eee-ooh-soo’…VJK.,

instructions, 1. Shrimp  --  I like to saute the shrimp first and set aside.  That way you are only using one pan for easier clean up.  In a large sauce pan  --  we will be adding the pasta back into this pan along with the shrimp and sauce so make sure it is big enough.  Heat up the olive oil and red pepper flakes on medium high heat and saute until they just start to turn pink.  These will go back in the sauce right at the end so you do NOT want to over cook.  As soon as I see a little pink I remove them to a plate. You don't want them all curled and pink.  That would be too done. No need to cover they will reheat back in the pan.  They will only take 1-2 minutes is all.
2. Sauce  --  Now in the same pan add the remaining olive oil and bring to medium heat.  Add the garlic shallots and anchovy and cook a couple of minutes until they slightly soften.  Don't worry  --  If you are not an anchovy fan once they cook up and get brown they get almost sweet in flavor (this is also true of the anchovy paste).  Much different than anchovies NOT cooked - they really add a nice flavor. Then stir in the tomatoes and cook another minute or two just to get them started on medium high heat. Reduce to medium heat add in the dried oregano white wine and a little salt and pepper and cook about 15-20 minutes until the tomatoes start to break apart.  Add in the parsley and basil and bring the heat up to medium high. By now the wine has cooked off a bit and the tomatoes should have made their own fresh sauce.
3. Pasta  --  Remember fresh pasta takes a lot less time to cook. Bring a pot a salted water to a boil and cook according to directions.  After the pasta is done drain and set to the side.  You will be adding this to the sauce in just a minute.  NOTE:  I always reserve a little pasta water in case you want to thin out the sauce a bit.  Reserve 1 cup.
4. Shrimp  --  Right before the pasta is done add the shrimp back into the sauce and let it finish cooking and reheating.  It will only take a minute or two as you finish the pasta.
5. Finishing  --  Add the pasta to the sauce and shrimp and toss well.  The pasta should soak up all the juice.  If you like it a bit thinner just add a little of the pasta water you reserved. Toss well and put in a large serving bowl.  I like to finish it by drizzling a little olive oil over the top some grated parmesan and fresh parsley.
6. Now that is my version of spaghetti with a twist.  Please give it a try. Serve this with a classic caesar salad and a toasted baguette and it doesn't get any better. ENJOY!,

instructions, 1. For the pre-ferment:
2. Stir together the flours salt and yeast in a large bowl or the bowl of an electric stand mixer.
3. Add 3/4 cup water stirring until everything comes together and makes a coarse ball (you can mix it with the paddle attachment -- I think it is easier to do it by hand). Adjust the flour or water as needed; the dough shouldn't be too sticky or stiff.
4. Flour your work surface and transfer the dough. Knead for 4-6 minutes (or mix with the dough hook for 4 minutes) or until the dough is soft and pliable "tacky but not sticky.".
5. Transfer the dough to a lightly-oiled bowl and roll it around to coat with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for one hour or until it swells to 1 1/2 times its original size.
6. Remove the dough from the bowl knead lightly to degas and return it to the bowl covered with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for up to three days or freeze in an air-tight plastic bag for up to three months.
7. Bread:
8. Remove the pre-ferment from the icebox and cut into 10 small pieces (I use kitchen shears). Let it sit an hour covered with plastic wrap to take off the chill.
9. Stir together the bread flour semolina flour salt and yeast in a large bowl or bowl of an electric stand mixer. Add the pre-ferment pieces oil honey and 1 1/4 cups water. Stir until the dough forms a ball or use the paddle attachment at low speed. Add water in dribbles as necessary to achieve a soft and pliable dough.
10. Lightly flour your work surface and knead your dough (or use a dough hook at low speed) adding flour as needed to achieve a soft but not sticky dough for about 10 minutes. Form the dough into a ball lightly oil a large bowl and roll the dough around in the bowl to coat with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.
11. At this point I refrigerate the dough overnight. Mr. Reinhart instead ferments the dough at room temperature for 2 hours or until it doubles divides the dough gently in three pieces shapes the dough (see below) taking care not to degas it too much places the dough on a baking pan (or pans) lined with parchment sprinkles with sesame seeds (see below) covers with plastic wrap and refrigerates overnight. As explained in the preamble in my hands the dough over-rose in the refrigerator lost its shape and wouldn't rise in the oven. And thus I divide shape and bake the loaves the next day as explained below. It gives me more control of the proofing process.
12. The next morning take the dough from the refrigerator (it will have grown) and divide it gently into 3 pieces. Gently shape as you wish taking care to degas as little as possible. To achieve the S shape shown in the photograph extend each dough piece to about 24 inches. Working from each end simultaneously coil the dough (in opposite directions) towards the center. Place the shaped doughs on parchment-lined pans mist with water sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired mist with vegetable oil spray and cover with plastic wrap. Proof the dough for an hour or two; it is ready for the oven when it stays dimpled when poked. The loaves should be about twice as large as when first shaped but DON'T let them over-rise.
13. Preheat the oven to 500°F (my oven is too rickety to get that hot; I have to use the convection option). Uncover the doughs and place in the oven; Pour 1 cup of water in the steam pan. Mr. Reinhart also sprays the oven walls with water three times at 30 second intervals and then reduces the heat to 450°F.
14. Bake for about 15 minutes and then rotate the pans 180 degrees. Gently separate the loaves if they are touching. Continue baking for 10-15 minutes to achieve a rich golden brown. The internal temperature of the bread should be about 200-205°F.
15. Transfer the loaves to a cooling rack and cool for at least 45 minutes.
16. To freeze when cooled wrap each loaf in a freezer bag and close with a wire twist.,

instructions, 1. PREPARE THE BACCALA: Three days before cooking place the pieces of dried cod (baccala) in a large pan cover with cold water and refrigerate. (Do yourself a favor and cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap AND aluminum foil or your refrigerator will be filled with a very strong fishy smell!) Soak for 3 days to remove the salt. Turn the pieces of fish occasionally and change the water every 6 to 8 hours. By the third day the cod will be plump soft fleshy and well hydrated. Rinse under cold water and pat dry. The baccala is now ready for the recipe. (This is NOT part of the preparation time listed in the recipe).
2. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
3. Remove any skin and bones from the fish dry with paper towels and cut into 6 pieces.
4. Grease a 9x12-inch-deep oven-proof dish with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Layer with half the potatoes half the onions half the cod and half the tomatoes. Sprinkle with half the parsley.
5. Add the raisins toasted pignoli capers olives and the rest of the potatoes onions and cod. Pour in the rest of the tomatoes with the juices. Season with the salt pepper and the remaining parsley. Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the top and bake uncovered for 45 to 50 minutes or until potatoes are tender.
6. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Serve in soup bowls.
7. Remember on Christmas Eve this is only one of at least seven fish or seafood dishes that are to follow in the same meal. This recipe serves 6 as a part of a larger meal. If you are making only this recipe you will probably want to double or triple it.

3. Reduce heat to medium low and cook the tomatoes until all the liquid has evaporated but the tomatoes are still slightly chunky.

Season both sides of the cod with salt and freshly ground black pepper and sear each side for about 2 minutes or until nicely browned. When the fillets are seared place them on a baking sheet. Put cod in the oven to finish cooking. (According to Chef Ripert an easy test for doneness is to insert a metal skewer into the center of a fillet for 5 seconds. The fish is done when the skewer goes in easily and when removed feels slightly warm to your lip.).
5. Place 1/2 cup of the beans in a food processor with the reserved bean-cooking liquid and purée until smooth to make the sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
6. To serve spoon tomato compote in the center of each plate and place a cod fillet on top. Spoon bean sauce outside the compote and sprinkle reserved whole cooked beans around the fish and over the two sauces. Drizzle with tiny drops of truffle oil.,

name, Tiramisu Parfait With Homemade Ladyfingers, 
cuisine, European >> Italian >> Italian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Homemade Ladyfingers:
2. Take cream cheese out of the fridge and set aside to become room temperature.
3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.Get your pastry or ziplock bag ready. For the ziplock cut a small opening (about 3/4 of an inch) on one of the bottom edges of the bag.
4. In your mixer put on the whipping tool. Beat the egg yolks and 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar on high speed for about 5 minutes or until the mixture becomes thick and pale yellow.  (When you raise the beaters the batter should fall back into the bowl in a slow ribbon.) Beat in the vanilla extract. Remove egg yolks from this bowl and put in a large separate bowl. Sift the loose flour over the batter but do not mix inches Rinse out the mixer bowl and the whipping tool to start the next mixture.
5. In the same bowl you just rinsed whip the egg whites until soft peaks form (when the eggs begin to look like spongy whipped cream not quite as thick though). Slowly add the other 3 tablespoons of granulated sugar and whip until stiff peaks form (when the mixture is just like cool whip -- WARNING: it won't taste like cool whip).
6. Hand stir the white mixture into the yolk mixture in three additions. Remember: only until it is mixed together -- no further! Put the batter in the pastry bag and squeeze the batter into 15 3-5 inch long ladyfingers on the wax paper covered baking sheet or sheets. Leave at least a one inch space between the ladyfingers.
7. When you are out of batter place the powdered sugar in a wire strainer and lightly sift the sugar over the tops of the cookies. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until the ladyfingers are firm but barely browned and are still spongy when pressed with a finger. While baking rinse all of your dirty dishes for the next steps. WARNING: If your oven seems a little steamy while baking don't worry mine does that too --.
8. Remove the baking sheets from the oven. Let the ladyfingers cool for a few minutes and release them from the wax paper with a spatula while they are still warm. Don't let them completely cool before removing them from the wax paper because they stick and its hard to remove them without breaking. Finish cooling the ladyfingers on the wire rack and set aside for we will use them in the future!
9. Tiramisu Parfaits:
10. Turn off the oven you don't need it anymore. Whip your whipping cream until it reaches soft peaks then mix in sugar until it reaches soft peaks. Slowly add 3 TBSP of sugar. Beat until stiff peaks. Take the cream out and put aside in a separate bowl. Try not to eat too much of it. You will need it later --  Clean out mixing bowl and whipping attachment once again!
11. Place all of the cream cheese in the same mixing bowl used before (less dishes the better!) until smooth and ribbon-like. Dump in 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 tsp vanilla and mix on the mixer's lowest setting. Whisk in half of the whipped cream and 6 TBSP of chopped or grated chocolate pieces. Do not mix! Just stir. by hand until well combined. Then put aside. This is your tiramisu mixture.
12. If you are using the powdered espresso mix it with the hot water now. Take all of the ladyfingers and let them soak in the espresso or dark coffee. Tip: You might need some more liquid for the fingers to soak inches. Once soaked all the way through place 3/4 of the ladyfingers into the bottom of the ramekins. Make sure that all of the bowls have about the same amount of ladyfingers. Save the other 1/4 for later --.
13. Take your tiramisu mixture and evenly distribute it to each of the ramekins. Sift a layer of cocoa powder over each tiramisu generously -- Place the remaining ladyfingers on top of this layer -- evenly among the bowls --.
14. Take the rest of your whipped cream and evenly distribute it among the bowls. Cover each with plastic wrap and put in the fridge for at least four hours. I know it's a bummer.
15. Take them out of the fridge and coat once more with cocoa powder generously --.
16. What are you doing reading this? Go enjoy your dessert with five friends or family -- or if you're a pig just eat them all yourself!,

cuisine, European >> Italian >> Italian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Slice bread all the way through top to bottom make slices about  1- 1 1/2 inches thick set aside.
2. Put all ingredients in Food processor blender or use an immersion blender with everything in a bowl or 2 cup glass measuring cup (this is my favorite method the blender is my last choice). Zizz everything up until there are no more chunks of anything. Taste the mix and adjust - some garlic is mild some have more bite - you want a good strong garlic taste. The mix will be kind of soupy it firms after chilling if you have leftovers - when you go to use it again let it soften a few minutes until spreadable.
3. If you add cheese you might not want to add the salt especially if you use the kind in a can - I usually add fresh and like it with a little salt. Though the cheese can cause a little sticking on the grill it tastes great and worth a little clean up.( If doing this in the broiler - don't add the cheese to the mix - but sprinkle it on the bread after you turn it over and broil till toasty. ).
4. Spread a nice thin coat of butter mix on both sides of you bread. I usually stack them on a cookie sheet if I'm using the whole loaf  - for just the two of us I use 4 slices and save the rest for another day.
5. I usually grill the bread when everything else is almost done cooking time varies with your grill and  whether you're using gas or charcoal.
6. Put the bread on the grill check it often you want it kind of golden toasty or  a little darker - sometimes the edges get over cooked in spots it's ok . Move the bread around as needed to keep from burning My gas grill is hotter in the center so I have to spin the bread on the edges to keep it even - grill both sides of the bread it usually takes a couple of minutes per side  serve ASAP Great with wine or a cold beer - I like to dip it in barbecue sauce.
7. Remember - this is flexible - you can leave out all the extras except for the garlic - or add other seasonings like oregeno. Enjoy!
8. Important - Use the butter mix within a week or freeze the leftovers.,

instructions, 1. Set a big pot of water to boil for the pasta.  Cook as directed.
2. Put each chicken breast one at a time into a gallon-size zippie bag.  Use a kitchen mallet or a heavy skillet to pound the chicken to about 1/2 inch thick.  This is a great step for getting out frustrations.
3. In a large bowl beat together the egg and the water.
4. Now you want to have a station set up for this next part.  A plate with flour a plate with the egg and a plate with the breadcrumbs.  With each chicken breast you need to coat each breast in this order:  flour egg wash then breadcrumbs.
5. After each breast has been properly coated set them on a plate to the side.
6. In a medium skillet saute diced onion in 1 Tbs olive oil until they turn opaque about 4-5 minutes then add the red pepper flake and the mushrooms and saute and additional 6-8 minutes.  Then add the grape tomatoes to the skillet.  Let them saute for a few minutes until they soften then using your wooden spoon crush each tomato.  If it's too hard to crush let it cook just a bit longer.
7. Add salt and pepper to taste and continue cooking until tomatoes are very soft and mixed with the rest of the veggies.  Right at the end add half of the chopped basil.
8. You should be cooking the chicken at the same time that you are cooking the sauce.  When you are waiting on the onions and/or mushrooms to cook this is a good time to get the chicken going.
9. Preheat 1 TBS olive oil in another large skillet or griddle over medium heat.  Also preheat your broiler.
10. Cook the chicken breasts for 4-5 minutes then flip and cook 3-4 additional minutes.
11. After each breast is cooked in the skillet place them on a baking sheet and top with some of the sauce then top with a mixture of both cheeses.  Place under the preheated broiler until cheese is melted and golden bubbly.
12. While this is working toss the cooked pasta with the remaining tomato mushroom sauce.
13. Plate some pasta and a chicken breast on each plate and top with remaining freshly chopped basil.,

instructions, 1. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil add the onions and bring to a medium-high heat. Season the onions generously with Kosher salt and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes. The onions should be very soft and aromatic but have no color. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper and saute for another 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off heat and allow to cool.
2. In a large bowl combine the meats eggs Parmigiano parsley and bread crumbs. It works well to squish the mixture with your hands. Add the cooled onion mixture season generously with Kosher salt and squish some more. Add the water and do 1 final really good squish. The mixture should be quite wet.
3. Test the seasoning of the mix by making a mini hamburger size patty and cooking it. The mixture should taste really good! If it doesn't it is probably missing salt. Add more. Add more anyway.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
5. Shape the meat into desired size. Some people like 'em big; some people like 'em small. I prefer meatballs slightly larger than a golf ball. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring to a medium-high heat. Brown the meatballs on all sides.
6. Place them on a cookie sheet and bake them in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes or until the meatballs are cooked all the way through. If using right away add them to a big pot of marinara sauce. If not using right away they can be frozen for later use. Serve with pasta and sauce or just eat them straight out of the pot! YUM!,

instructions, 1. In a large mixing bowl use your hands or a wooden spoon to mix together the beef veal and eggs. Add the bread crumbs parsley basil salt garlic and pepper and mix it well.
2. Tear the bread into pieces and transfer it to a mixing bowl. Add the milk and let it sit for 5 to 7 minutes or until the milk is nearly absorbed. Add the bread to the meat and use your hands or a wooden spoon to mix it well. Stir in the grated cheese.
3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until the meat mixture is firm.
4. Using an ice cream scoop remove chunks of meat and roll them between dampened palms into meatballs each weighing about 3 ounces. Refrigerate the meatballs for at least 10 minutes before proceeding with the recipe.
5. To saute the meatballs heat one teaspoon of the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot add the meatballs and cook them for about 10 minutes turning them until they are browned on all sides. Transfer them to a platter and set them aside.
6. In the same pan heat the remaining teaspoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and garlic and sauté them for 8 to 10 minutes or until they are browned.
7. Meanwhile in a large pot large enough to hold the meatballs heat the marinara sauce over medium-high heat for 6 to 8 minutes or until the sauce starts to boil. Stir in the onions and garlic.
8. Add the browned meatballs and any accumulated juices and cook them over medium heat for about 45 minutes. Do not cover them while cooking. Remove them from the heat and set them aside for about 45 minutes or until they have had ample time to mellow and the flavors of the sauce and meat intermingle.
9. To store the meatballs let them cool in the sauce. Transfer them to a tightly lidded storage container and refrigerate them for up to 1 week or freeze them for up to 1 month.,

8. As for Once a Month Cooking -- this is how I do it --
9. I double triple or quadruple the recipe except when it comes to the step to place it in the casserole dish I instead place it in large round ice cream buckets I've sprayed with cooking spray place some plastic wrap on top then place lid & freeze. Then on the day you want to cook it get it out of freezer in the morning run bucket under water to loosen a bit. then take contents out (in one huge lump) & put in large round crockpot it fits perfectly! Set on low come back 5-6 hours later & voila dinner! You can also use the ice cream bucket method for other casseroles & soups & stews.,

instructions, 1. Next to how yummy and good for you this dish is what I love about it is how incredibly easy it is to make. And fast too. When preparing meats fish poultry (all animals) my suggestion is to forgo the usual market aisles and seek out the specialists – butchers fish market guys etc. These professionals can educate you on all the wonders of farming buying special cuts and preparing “meat” thus making your meal and life exponentially better.  I like Italian sausages (the pork kind) because they tend to be spicy and that’s my palette. Of course you can find a mild sausage which is why having a dialogue with your meat dealer is so importanto:).
2. The sausages take about 13 minutes to cook stove top so I usually get them started after I’ve added the olive oil garlic and onion to a separate pan (on low heat) for the vegetables and beans. As they cook/saute/get periodically rolled around the sauce pan I work on the veggies.  After the garlic and onions start to brown add the beans then the spinach. Ok so you get the picture. The last vegetable to be added should be the peppers because they have essentially already been cooked/grilled. (a little cheat here – sometimes when I visit the farmer’s market I buy in bulk and spend a few hours on a weekend afternoon cooking up stuff which I will freeze or jar and eat later…case in point:) Toss regularly and once the vegetables are done (the spinach is cooked) add the lemon juice salt pepper and fresh herbs to taste. Slice sausages at a diagonal and toss with veggies and beans almost like a salad. Add Parmesan and mangia!
3. To the Table: Don’t forget the wine and remote.

instructions, 1. Mix the rice and tomato sauce together place in a microwave safe casserole.
2. Take the hamburger that is mixed with a little bacon drippings (this is ok because the hamburger was 90% lean).
3. Layer the meat in next.
4. Layer in the corn then layer the mushrooms.
5. Then the corn then the bacon for flavor and decoration.
6. Now the shredded cheese.
7. Microwave on high 5 minutes or so until heated through and the cheese is melted.
8. This sounds strange so if you are a health nut remember that the hamburger was 90% lean and the bacon is for garnish so there is only a little (do not use bacon bits).   Did you know you can also add chili beans as a layer if you want. The 1/2 envelope of onion soup might be used to add flavor to the tomato sauce if the sauce is a variety that is boring or bland.  Use a little and taste to see if you want to add more or use none if not needed.,

instructions, 1. Wash and chop asparagus zucchini yellow squash and tomatoes.  I look for thin asparagus that has a crisp snap when bent.  Chop in to 1/2 inches pieces.  Cut the zucchini and yellow squash in to quarters lengthwise then finely chop in to pieces.  Dice the tomatoes.
2. Start boiling water - follow directions on the box.  Cook the pasta while working on sauteing the veggies.
3. Drizzle 1/3rd of the olive oil in to a saute pan.  Let it get warm.  Turn your burner to medium heat.
4. When the olive oil has warmed add asparagus and red pepper flakes.  Toss the mixture 2-4 times in the next 5 minutes.
5. After the asparagus have cooked for 5 minutes add in zucchini and yellow squash.  Cook and toss for 5 minutes.
6. Add tomatoes 1/2 of the salt and 1/2 of the pepper.  Cook for 5-10 minutes or until the tomatoes have cooked throughly.
7. Drain pasta when it's done cooking and set aside.
8. Pour veggie mix in to a bowl or place it on low heat and use a new pan.  Add the remaining olive oil to the pan add the remaining salt and pepper.  (If you like spicy food - add more red pepper flakes at this point).  Let the olive oil get warm.  Turn your burner to medium high.
9. Once the oil is warm toss your pasta in to the pan.  Toss often.  You are looking to add a little crisp to the pasta.  Keep a close eye on it to make sure it doesn't burn.
10. Once the pasta has a crisped up a bit add veggie mix back in and mix well.
11. Serve and enjoy.,

2. For the Cheese Bread place the warm water in a small bowl sprinkle the yeast over the water add the pinch of sugar and stir to moisten the yeast.  Set aside to proof; if the mixture bubbles and has foam on the surface it is active.
3. Beat the eggs with the olive oil Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese butter and salt in a medium bowl.  Add the proofed yeast and mix well.  Stir this mixture into the starter sponge.  Add the flour and mix well.  If using a stand mixer knead by machine for about 10 minutes adding more flour as needed to create a smooth soft dough (you may  have to add up to 1/2 cups additional flour but remember keep the dough soft).  Add in the cubed Gruyere.  Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead for another minute.  If kneading by hand you can go ahead and add the Gruyere cheese before the 10 minute kneading.
4. Shape the dough into a smooth flattened ball.
5. Butter and flour a 9 x 2-inch round pan (at least 2 quarts) and place the dough in the pan (I suggest you use at least a 10-inch round spring-side pan).  Cover and set aside to rise until doubled in volume about 2 hours.  If making 2 smaller loaves place them in two 9 x 5 loaf pans or two 8 x 2-inch round pans.
6. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

12. Add in egg and cracker crumbs or bread crumbs.  Combine well.
13. Add in parsley combine well.
14. Roll into meatballs.
15. Drop RAW meatballs into sauce.  In order for meat to cook through throughly they must remain in simmering sauce for a minimum of 40 minutes.  Be careful not to stir sauce to vigorously during first 20-30 minutes as that may break up your meatballs just stir enough to make sure meatballs are completely submerged in sauce.  Once 40-50 minutes has elapsed sauce should be ready to eat as the meat should be cooked.  I prefer allowing sauce to simmer on low heat for a 2-4 hours as the longer this sauce cooks the better it tastes.  The meat also absorbs more flavor from the sauce itself.  As long as you cook meats at least 40-50 minutes in sauce mixture you should be fine.  This does however change based on the size of the meatballs you make.  I make ones around the size of a golf ball.  Larger meatballs take longer to cook.  You can always take one out and cut it in half to see if they are cooked through throiughly.

2. Meanwhile season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Cut into small pieces. Heat 3 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels.
3. In same skillet cook garlic onion carrot celery and red pepper flakes. Cook 5 minutes. Add spinach and cook 10 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Combine chicken and spinach mixture. purée in a food processor or blender. (If you have a small machine do this in batches.).
5. In a large bowl combine ricotta egg Romano parsley and basil. Season with salt and pepper and mix well. Add chicken purée and combine very well. Chill for 30 minutes.
6. Meanwhile prepare sauce. In a large stockpot heat 3 tbsp olive oil on medium-high heat. Add onion garlic and carrot and sauté until onion begins to brown. Add tomatoes and purée. Stir well. Add wine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and let simmer 30 minutes.

10. Place shells in baking pan in a single layer. When all shells are filled cover with sauce. Top with grated provolone and parsley.

2. Add to the meat your yellow onion and mushrooms; add sea salt to taste. Reduce heat to low.
3. Add to this mixture your red sauce and stewed tomatoes. Crush the stewed tomatoes with your mixing spoon and incorporate them into your mixture. Add rosemary black pepper and sugar to taste.
4. Simmer for about 30 minutes covered under low heat stirring occasionally. If the sauce is starting to dry up add about two cups of water at a time.
5. Add to the sauce your parsley and red wine (more or less to your taste). You may need to add a bit more water to keep your sauce moist. Simmer for another 30 minutes or until your pasta is ready.
6. This is a chunky sauce so serve with a pasta that will hold onto this sauce. I usually serve this with garden rotini and grated parmesan. Save any leftovers for the next day! Yum!,

cuisine, European >> Italian >> Italian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Note: I chopped the spinach finely in a food processor (only too about 5 seconds) then boiled it very briefly-about 15 seconds in boiling salted water. Refreshed the spinach under cold running water in a fine mesh strainer and used a wooded spoon to squeeze out the excess water. The original recipes reads: Boil the spinach in well-salted water until tender refresh under cool running water and squeeze as dry as you can. Chop spinach finely (either in a food processor for evenly green dumplings or with a knife for a speckled appearance.).
2. Mix the spinach with the ricotta and other ingredients except salt pepper and tomato sauce to make a very soft dough.
3. Season lightly with salt and pepper but not with a heavy hand — the flavors are very subtle.
4. Roll [1] golf ball-sized lump as round as you can in plenty of flour. The dough is so soft you will never manage a sphere but that is why they are called malfatti. I used an oiled cookie scoop to shape the dough. I soon realized the less I touch the dough the better. May take a few times preparing this recipe to get the hang of it.
5. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil (the spinach water is fine if you still have it) and drop in the ball to make sure it is strong enough not to break up. If the ball doesn't break apart roll the rest of your dough to make about a dozen dumplings. If it isn’t mix a bit more flour in and then roll the balls.
6. Cook at a gentle simmer for 10-15 minutes counting from when they rise to the surface. You can take them out sooner if you like an oozing middle. I cooked the malfatti a solid fifteen minutes.
7. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the dumplings to a serving platter.
8. Two topping options and I tested both:  Topping #1. Serve malfatti on a bed of warm tomato sauce and top with grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese.
9. Topping #2: Or fry butter with 12 sage leaves until the leaves are crispy and the butter nutty; pour directly on top of the malfatti. Serve with amount of grated Parmesan. However I skipped the Parmesan cheese for topping #2.,

You can also spritz the loaves with water a few times while the bread is baking. The steam helps keep the bread softer longer so the crust develops more slowly.,

instructions, 1. Get your briquettes hot in the charcoal grill or use campfire coals. Lay the pie iron in the coals to pre-heat it on both sides.
2. When the pie iron is hot remove it from the coals and butter the interior with the margarine using a cooking brush. Make sure to butter the edges as well where the two halves of the pie iron clamp together. It will smoke some as you brush on the margarine but that's fine.
3. Lay one side of the greased pie iron face up and lay a slice of bread on it pushing it in a bit to fit. The edges will extend beyond the perimeter of the pie iron slightly but that's okay.
4. On the bread sprinkle on a good bit of mozarella cheese then layer on about 10-12 thin slices of pepperoni. Next pour on just a little of the tomato sauce (use regular tomato sauce if you don't want it spicy) and then top it with a tomato slice. Cover this with another slice of bread and close the pie iron with the greased top half of the unit.
5. You will have to compress the pie iron a bit to close it and you'll find that there's a hook attached to the handles to keep it closed while baking in the hot coals.
6. Now lay the pie iron firmly down in the hot coals for TWO MINUTES. Then flip it over and allow it to cook on the second side for TWO MINUTES. Time is pretty critical to avoid burning the calzone.
7. At the end of the second two minutes take the pie iron to where you can open it and extract the calzone to a plate. You can use a butter knife to loosen any stubborn ones. Be careful to not burn yourself -- an adult should do this step of the process.
8. With a sharp knife carefully trim off any burnt edges (the calzone should be golden brown -- adjust your time on subsequent servings to achieve the desired doneness) allow to cool for a couple of minutes and then cut the calzone in half on the diagonal --  serve warm.
9. NOTE: You can vary the ingredients all you want -- here are some great variations: You can use 4 small tortillas instead of the bread with butter or cheese in between layers 2 flour tortillas and 2 corn tortillas make for a nice flavor and presentation; for different fillings try canned Skyline Chili and hot dog slices with cheese and fancy mustard; any sort of pizza toppings with pepperoni; thick sausage gravy; scrambled eggs a canadian bacon slice and syrup or; blueberry pie filling. Also vary the cheeses to add more zest -- I like adding freshly grated parmesan to the mozarella sometimes. Hot pepper cheese and Swiss Cheese are also good choices. You are limited only by your imagination on the fillings that you choose -- Enjoy!
10. TIP: I like to have all my fillings at room temperature when I begin.,

3. In a deep 9x13 lasagna pan add a few oz of the pasta sauce to lightly coat the bottom. Add 3 lasagna noodles to cover the bottom of the pan with out overlapping the noodles.
4. Add half the ricotta/spinach mixture by dolloping it onto the noodles sprinkle zucchini tomato slices broccoli onion mushrooms and bell pepper slices. Add 20 or so oz (the rest of the first jar of pasta sauce) covering the veggies.
5. On the next layer add 3 more lasagna noodles the other half of the spinach and ricotta mixture the rest of the veggies and half a jar of pasta sauce.
6. Then to finish it off layer the remaining lasagna noodles the rest of the pasta sauce and the parmigiano-reggiano cheese as well as the mozzarella.
7. Bake in the oven for 40-50 minutes until cheese begins to brown and bubble. Let sit for 10 minutes after removing from oven to allow liquids to be reabsorbed by veggies.
8. NOTE: As mentioned in the comments this is a very thick lasagna and there is often a lot of liquid in the pan. It is best to let the lasagna sit for 10 minutes after removing from the oven to let it absorb some of the liquid. Adding salt to remove liquid as suggested is a great idea if you plan on eating the entire lasagna the day it is made/soon after. However this lasagna freezes and reheats VERY well and that is largely because the excess liquid when it is originally made helps keep the lasagna moist after being reheated in the microwaving process. Another way to reduce the amount of liquid is to use the type of noodles that you don't have to pre-cook however I prefer the texture of the ones that need precooking.,

instructions, 1. Cheese  --  I like to make the cheese first. This way they can rest in the refrigerator and firm up a bit before sauteing.  NOTE:  Use dental floss to make a nice easy clean cut through the fresh mozzarella. It is easy and no clean up. You can also freeze the mozzarella for a bit 15-20 minutes which will also make it easier to slice if using a knife.
2. Set up a breading station 3 small plates or bowls; 1) flour 2) eggs (beaten) and 3) bread crumbs. Dip each slice in the flour coating well but make sure to shake off any extra then the egg and finally the bread crumbs.  Make sure to press the bread crumbs in well.  Place the cheese slices on a baking sheet or plate lined with parchment paper or even foil and then refrigerate. I like to do this about 30 minutes ahead of time. Once it is chilled and firm they are easier to saute.
3. Vinaigrette  --  I like to do this in a mini food processor or a blender works great. I just add it all and blend. There is such a small amount of olive oil I just mix it all at once. Just blend until everything is mixed and pureed well.  Refrigerate until ready to use.
4. Salad  --  Add your favorite mix of greens to a bowl and toss with just a teaspoon of the vinaigrette.  You don't want to weigh down the salad.  Just a light drizzle is all you need.
5. Mozzarella  --  In a large non-stick pan (works best) add the olive oil and bring to medium high to high heat. The mozzarella doesn't take long so have everything ready to go as far as plating.  Add the mozzarella to the hot oil and saute 2-3 minutes until golden brown on each side. A little may seep drip or ooze out but that is ok. Remove immediately from the heat and put the cheese back on the plate or baking sheet with the parchment to slightly cool just a few minutes as you plate your salad.
6. Plate  --  Then on each plate add the greens and top with one of the tomato slices. Lightly seasoned with salt and pepper. Then top with the mozzarella slice the remaining tomato slice. Again season lightly with salt and pepper.  And to finish  --  drizzle the remain vinaigrette over each of the top tomato slices. Top with fresh grated parmesan if you want.
7. Serve  --  ENJOY!,

Therefore add them together with the tripe a few drops of oil salt pepper parsley and the spices (cloves to taste). Stir well to combine and remove from the fire when all is heated through.
2. Pour the contents of the pot into a bowl. Don't wash the pot but rather refill it layering it with the eggplant the tripe and then the ground meat; dust the meat with some grated caciocavallo (don't put all of it into the filling however) then repeat with more layers until all is used up. Sprinkle the oil over the top and spread the hard boiled eggs over it too.
3. Lightly beat the fresh egg and mix the remaining caciocavallo into it together with salt pepper and a little more parsley. Spread this mixture over the top and bake in the oven (400 F 200 C) until it is nicely browned.,

2. Chop tomatoes coarsely removing seeds as they make sauce too runny.
3. Roughly chop approximately 1/4-1/2c basil leaves and set aside.
4. Chop 1/2c parsley and set aside.
5. Add 1-2 tablespoons olive oil to a non-stick pan(I actually use a large non-stick wok!) Cook tomatoes garlic and chillis until tendercrisp over medium-high heat. DO NOT overcook tomatoes the last thing you want is a soggy mess. You should be able to easily identify the tomato chunks in the pasta! This is NOT a traditional soupy sauce! It's a fresh light tasting summery dish not meant to be 'drowned' in excess sauce.
6. Toss in the HOT drained fusilli and stir through crumbled feta and basil over low heat until feta begins to melt. The feta shouldn't be melted all the way just warmed through and softened! It will continue to melt on the plate you should be able to see lots of chunky bits of cheese poking through.
7. Stir through the chopped parsley and approximately 1/2c olives.
8. Top with fresh grated parmesan.
9. Enjoy with a chilled glass of chardonnay!,

instructions, 1. In a 3 quart or larger slow cooker combine the carrots broth and escarole. Cover and cook on LOW for 4 hours.
2. In a medium bowl combine the turkey onion eggs bread crumbs grated Parmesan salt and pepper. Mix well and make 1 inch meatballs and carefully add to the slow cooker at the 4 hour mark.
3. Cover and cook 4 hours longer or until the meat and veggies are cooked through. Serve sprinkled with the additional cheese.
4. Note: Swiss chard or spinach would be good subs for the escarole. I would separate the leaves from the stems of the Swiss chard and add them first. The leaves of the chard and spinach should be added right at the end - you can raise to high for the last few minutes.,

instructions, 1. Add chicken bouillon cube to 1 cup of water and microwave for about three minutes.  Stir until cube is dissolved.
2. Put each chicken breast between sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a flat side of a mallet until even and 1/4 inch thickness.
3. In a shallow bowl combine 1/2 cup flour and 1 tbs Essence and stir to combine thoroughly.
4. Dredge the chicken breast halves in the seasoned flour mixture shaking to remove any excess flour.
5. Heat 1 tbs olive oil in a large stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking and 1 tablespoon of the butter until melted.
6. Add the chicken breasts and fry until golden brown on the first side then flip and cook the second side until it is golden brown.  The breasts should only cook about 2 minutes to 3 minutes on each side depending on the size of the breasts.  If you fry the chicken longer than this it will be overcooked.
7. Transfer the chicken to a shallow dish and it cover the dish tightly with plastic wrap so that no steam can escape.  This will seal the moisture into the chicken.
8. Add 2 tablespoons of butter to the pan that the chicken was cooked in and add the onions.  Cook stirring constantly until soft about two minutes.
9. Add the mushrooms. Cook stirring frequently until mushrooms have given off their liquid and are starting to brown about two minutes.
10. Add the Marsala wine and bring to a boil scraping to remove any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
11. Cook until the wine has reduced by half about a total of four minutes.
12. Add the chicken bouillon water to the wine mixture in the pan and cook for 3 minutes.
13. Dissolve 1 tsp cornstarch in 2 tbs of cold water.   Quickly stir the corn starch water into the sauce.
14. Cook until the sauce has thickened slightly about 30 seconds to a minute.
15. Lower the heat to medium and return the chicken breasts to the pan (I liked to slice the chicken breasts before I do this)
16. and continue to cook until they are cooked through and the sauce has thickened about 3 to 4 minutes.
17. Swirl in the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter (I like to add 2 tbs butter).
18. Add salt and pepper to taste if desired.  I find that if the extra large bouillon cube was used the dish does not need extra salt.

instructions, 1. Mound flour on a cutting board or clean work surface and make a hole/well in the center of the flour. Crack the eggs into the well and add water and salt. Use a fork to break the yolks and slowly begin scooping flour into the well a little at a time until all the flour is incorporated into the liquid.
2. Knead dough until smooth. If the dough feels sticky it is too wet; add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it feels smooth and doesn't stick to your hands. Form dough into a log shape.
3. Cover dough with plastic wrap and let it rest 10-15 minutes. While you're waiting you can relax and drink some wine (this also applies to steps 4 and 7).
4. Knead again for a few more minutes until dough is smooth adding a bit more flour if needed. Again form it into a log shape cover and let rest another 10-15 minutes.
5. Slice log into five pieces of equal size. Dip each slice in flour to coat it and brush off any extra flour. Roll each slice with a rolling pin to flatten into small ovals and sprinkle with flour.
6. Run dough slices through a hand-crank pasta machine or KitchenAid mixer roller attachment at the 1 4 and 6 (wide medium and small) thickness settings. (Run all the sheets through on the wide setting then roll al of the sheets on medium etc. That allows the sheets to rest for a few minutes between rollings.) Skip the smallest setting if sheets have reached the desired thickness after two trips through the roller. You should be able to see the outline of your hand through the sheet. When dough is coming out of the roller pull on it gently to stretch it out. Sheets should be smooth and elastic.
7. Cut sheets in half so they are each about 12 inches long. Lay sheets on a tablecloth dust with a little flour and turn them over. When edges begin to dry (in 20-30 minutes) the pasta is ready to cut. Don't let it dry too much or sheets will buckle and caught in the roller.
8. Run pasta sheets through cutter and arrange noodles in loose nests on a tablecloth. Sprinkle with a little flour to keep strands from sticking together.
9. Cook in boiling salted water until al dente (2-3 minutes). If you're not planning to eat the pasta that day leave it to dry completely turning nests over after an hour or so. Dried pasta will keep in the pantry for a few months.,

instructions, 1. Dissolve the yeast and malt in the warm water and allow it to stand for approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Add the additional water (1 cup at room temperature) to the dissolved yeast mixture. Add the flour and salt to this mixture and continue to mix until the dough begins to hold together. Knead the dough to a soft smooth and elastic consistency.
2. Place the dough in a lightly floured bowl and cover the bowl with a cotton or linen towel. Allow the dough to rise until double in volume (approximately 2 hours).
3. Gently turn the risen dough onto a flour dusted work surface. Allow it to rest for 10 minutes. Dust a piece of canvas (untreated 100% cotton) or a proofing board (lumber core plywood) with flour. Cup your hands beneath the dough and delicately fold sections of it toward the center rolling it in quarter turns until it is round.
4. Turn the dough over and gently roll it on the work surface to firm its shape. Turn the dough over once more and place it on the canvas or board with the smooth side down. Cover it with a cotton or linen towel. Allow the dough to rise until it is puffy (approximately 30 minutes).
5. Gently flatten the dough. Ease your hands beneath the risen dough and turn it upside-down onto a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper. Once again ease your hands beneath the dough this time stretching it gently from the center out. Cover it with a cotton or linen towel. Allow the dough to rise for an additional 30 minutes.
6. As the dough is rising place a baking stone in the oven and set the temperature to 500°F Allow the oven to heat for 30 minutes.
7. Lower the oven temperature to 450°F Slide a baker’s peel beneath the parchment paper. Make a circular incision on the surface of the dough. Slide the parchment paper from the peell onto the baking stone.
8. After 20 minutes check the oven to see if the loaf is browning evenly. If the loaf is not browning evenly turn it around. If it is browning too quickly cover the loaf with aluminum foil. Allow the loaf to bake until it is a deep golden color (approximately 30 more minutes).
9. Remove the bread from the oven and allow it to cool on a rack.,

instructions, 1. Note: I use non-stick teflon coated pans I find that these produce the best results and I need little or no oil.
2. Peel and cut potatoes into 1cm cubes and boil until al dente (I use the microwave for this).
3. Finely dice garlic and onion and fry until translucent.
4. Crack eggs and whisk lightly.
5. Drain potatoes and fry bake or grill until light golden brown (like you are cooking fries).
6. Mix cheese and herbs in a large bowl and season.
7. Add the potatoes garlic and onion to the cheese and mix through.
8. Add the whisked eggs to the mix and fold through.
9. Heat a large non stick frying pan and pour in the mixture. (It may be a good idea to make 2 smaller frittate with this amount of ingredients as you will then have room to scrape into sides as they cook and you will have more room to turn the frittata).
10. Turn the heat down quite low otherwise the base will get burnt.
11. Scrape the sides of the frittata into the middles as they cook the raw egg will move to the edges and you can repeat the action.
12. When the frittata has cooked around the edges and there is only a section in the middle left uncooked place under a hot grill until nice and golden.
13. You may like to sprinkle cheese over the top while under the grill.
14. The best way to remove the frittata from the pan is to slide it out onto a warm plate this is why I insist on using non-stick pans
15. Slice like you would a pizza and serve. Personally I like the frittata warm but not hot but its also great cold.
16. Variations: as I have said it is so easy to vary this dish here are some suggestions --  pumpkin and sweet potato (cooked in the same way as the potato diced squash zucchini tomato aubergine (eggplant) corn mushrooms or broccoli. To turn it into a non-vego dish add some diced ham/bacon (fry a little in the pan) shredded chicken or turkey or even some flaked fish. I have even used tofu on occasion.
17. Yet another example of how versatile this dish is change your seasonings; whisk in with the eggs some curry powder cajun spices or some freshly chopped chilli. Enjoy  I believe alot of the joy of this dish comes from the cooking process itself.,

instructions, 1. Combine the spinach parmesan cheese mayo garlic powder.
2. Set aside in refrigerator.
3. Then partially thaw the chicken breast.  There are two ways to thaw it but only partially.
4. Method "A" is to use microwave on 30 percent power until it oddly thawed and still 1/2 frozen--need some ice crystals in them.
5. Method "B" is to plunge into cold ice cubes in the water  until partly thawed but with some ice crystals still present. You chose your method.  because many ice crystals are present this is safe altho usually not ok to use water to thaw.
6. When they are ready then grasp chicken in a dry paper towel and cut a pocket with a sharp knife in each chicken breast.  Stuff with the spinach mixture.
7. Wash handssurfaces and knife very  often when dealing with chicken please!  i put this n because if a new cook you wont know about it.
8. Now having cleaned up you are ready to brown the chicken on both sides 1 or two minutes per side in hot olive oil in a fry pan (I use black cast iron because I have good luck with it).
9. Sprinkle with the oregano.
10. You now have one of three methods to continue.
11. Method "A" - Lower the heat and simmer with a lid on until the liquid from the chicken is clear and any meat you test is firm and white not pink.
12. Method "B" - You can transfer to a clean microwave-safe pan and heat on 50 percent power until as described above only a few minutes.  Test as you go along and rotate if your microwave needs manual rotation.
13. Method "C" - You put into a 350°F oven 20 or 30 minutes.
14. Pour the warm reconstituted cream of mushroom soup or alfredo sauce on top.
15. Do not put alfredo sauce in the microwave to warm as it curdles up (use stovetop method to warm).
16. serve with garlic bread and red grape juice or red wine.,

instructions, 1. Make the ragù: In a 5- to 6-qt. Dutch oven melt the 6 Tbs. butter with the olive oil over medium heat. Add the celery carrots and onions and cook  stirring occasionally until softened and lightly golden about 15 minutes.
2. Add the beef pork and pancetta and cook breaking up the meats with a spoon and stirring often until the meats lose their redness 5 to 8 minutes.
3. Stir in the wine tomato purée and tomato paste and simmer vigorously until the liquid is almost evaporated 15 to 20 minutes.
4. Add the beef or chicken broth and the milk cover with the lid ajar reduce the heat to low and simmer gently until you have a rich concentrated sauce about 2-1/2 hours. Check every 30 minutes to see if more liquid is needed adding more broth if necessary to prevent scorching.
5. Season to taste with salt and pepper if needed. Let cool. Skim off the fat from the top if desired. You should have about 6 cups.
6. Cook the noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare a large bowl of ice water. Slip the noodles two or three at a time into the boiling water and cook them until they're tender and pale 3 to 5 minutes (thinner noodles will cook more quickly). If using dried noodles cook according to box directions.
7. Carefully scoop the noodles out of the water with a large wire skimmer and slide them into the ice water to stop the cooking. When they're cool layer them between clean dish towels until you're ready to assemble the lasagne (they'll keep this way for up to two hours).
8. Make the cream sauce: In a 2-qt. saucepan melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the flour and cook whisking constantly for 2 to 3 minutes. Do not let the mixture brown.
9. Slowly whisk in the hot milk and bring just to a simmer whisking frequently.
10. Reduce the heat to low and cook whisking often until the sauce has thickened to a creamy gravy-like consistency and no longer tastes of raw flour 10 to 12 minutes.
11. Remove from the heat and whisk in the salt pepper and nutmeg. If not using right away transfer to a bowl and press a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the sauce to keep a skin from forming. Plan to use the sauce within 30 minutes because it thickens if it’s left to sit for too long. If that should happen add a little warm milk and whisk well to thin it.
12. Assemble the lasagna: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 350°F Choose a baking dish that’s about 9x12 inches and 3 inches deep or about 10x14 inches and 2 inches deep. Butter the baking dish.
13. Spread 1/2 cup of ragù in a sparse layer on the bottom of the dish. Then cover with a slightly overlapping layer of cooked noodles cutting them as needed to fill the gaps. Spread one-third of the remaining ragù (about 1-1/2 cups) over the first layer of noodles.
14. Drizzle on one-third of the Basic Cream Sauce (about 1 cup) and spread it with a spatula or the back of a spoon.
15. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup Parmigiano. Add a new layer of noodles overlapping them slightly.
16. Repeat the layers as instructed above until all of the filling ingredients are used to make a total of three layers (you may not need all the pasta). Dot the top with the butter cubes.
17. Put the baking dish on a baking sheet and bake until heated through and bubbling at the edges 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
18. Make Ahead Tips:  You can prepare the ragù up to four days ahead and refrigerate it or freeze it for up to one month. Reheat gently until the sauce is warm enough to spread for assembling the lasagne. The assembled unbaked lasagne will keep for at least a day in the refrigerator. Alternatively you can freeze it for up to four months (make sure you wrap the dish tightly with plastic). Thaw the lasagne in the fridge and bring it to room temperature before baking.,

3. Add milk (additional liquid if necessary) to hold mixture together as it is kneaded.
4. Shape pastry into two balls.
5. Chill for 30 minutes or until ready to begin making the pie.
6. PREPARATION FOR FILLING: Remove the sausage meat from the casings; set aside in small bowl.
7. In another small bowl place all the mozzarella cut into 1/4-inch cubes; set aside.
8. In another small bowl place all the provolone cut into 1/4-inch cubes; set aside.
9. Do the same for the ham and salami and proscuitta; set aside keeping all the ingredients separate.
10. Boil dozen eggs; cool peel cut into quarters and set aside.
11. Make EGG WASH:In a blender add 10 eggs parsley 1/2 cup grating cheese.
12. Blend; set aside.
13. This will be used between layers of ingredients as the"holding agent" to keep all the ingredients together.
14. TO ASSEMBLE PIE: Roll chilled pastry on floured board to 1/8-inch thickness.
15. Make into 2 large circles to fit into a 9-inch deep-dish glass pie plate and to cover.
16. Better to do this in glass; it cooks more evenly and you can see if your bottom has fully cooked.
17. Fit the pastry into the pan and up the sides.
18. Begin by layering the quartered hard boiled eggs as the first layer on bottom about 1-inch apart from eachother.
19. In between each quartered slice of egg with your fingers place a small piece of sausage meat; going around the whole first layer of the pie.
20. Sprinkle a layer of grated cheese all around.
21. Next a thin layer of mozzarella; (one piece high) Next a thin layer of proscuitta; Next a thin layer of provolone cheese; Next a thin layer of salami; Next a thin layer of boiled ham.
22. Pour 1/2 cup of your egg wash over the first layer.
23. Begin again with your quartered eggs; alternating the quarters"in between" the quarters of the first layer.
24. Layer each ingredient as you did on the first layer and so on.
25. Proceed with your second layer; again egg wash poured over the layer etc.
26. Depending on the depth of the pie pan the size of your cut ingredients you may have two or three layers but don't fill it beyond the rim of the dish.
27. Cover the last layer with another piece of pastry dough and crimp together firmly"gluing" if necessary to keep things together as the pie expands.
28. Cut a steam hole on top and brush pastry with a tablespoon of milk (just to enhance the beauty of this meal for presentation) to form a glaze.
29. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
30. Bake for one hour or until the pie crust is golden on the top and ingredients are bubbly.
31. The aroma will tell you the pie is done!
32. If you filled the pie too much with egg wash or ingredients it may boil over.
33. It is a good idea to place a sheet of aluminum foil beneath the pie in the oven to catch any drips.
34. Serve the pie warm.
35. Keep Refrigerated; leftovers can be reheated nicely in a toaster oven or a microwave for 1 minute.,

2. place sliced mushrooms over top of chicken along with the tomato sauce and rosemary.
3. Bring to a simmer and remain cooking at a simmer. Do not boil it.
4. When mushrooms shrink down and chicken is no longer pink soft and tender remove from heat and serve.
5. Now there are tons of ways to serve this. I personally like mine over white or whole grain rice but you can serve it over penne or a linguine type of pasta. The sauce is NOT a thick sauce. It is very watery so do not expect this to be thick over the pasta.
6. *NOTE Also I put my Rosemary in a mortar & pedstal and really grind it down. If you have very fine Rosemary that works great too!,

instructions, 1. Saute bacon onion and garlic in hot oil for 5 minutes in a large frying pan.
2. Add ground beef salami parsley and basil and brown well.
3. If you have enough room in your pan add mushrooms tomato paste tomatoes and water.  I generally move the whole batch over to a stock pan at this point just because I don't have a frying pan big enough to hold all this.
4. Simmer uncovered for 1 hour or until very thick.
5. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
6. If you're preparing this for an immediate meal now is a good time to preheat the oven to 375°F  Otherwise it is very easy to make this in advance and refrigerate it until 30 minutes before you're ready to eat it.
7. Butter/grease a 12x9 inch lasagna or casserole dish.
8. Combine cottage cheese parmesan cheese and egg in separate bowl and mix well.
9. You're now ready to layer it all in there.  It's going to go as shown below:
10. On the bottom put a good layer of the tomato/meat sauce - not too thin but not more than a third of the total amount of the sauce you have.  I generally do a little less than a third of the total sauce.
11. Put on a layer of pasta - generally I get 12 inch long lasagna noodles that are 3 inches wide so 3 of the noodles placed side by side is a perfect layer.
12. Add a layer of the cottage cheese mixture - there are only going to be two layers of this stuff total so put half of what you have in this layer.
13. Put 1/4 pound of mozzarella cheese evenly over the previous layer.  You should have 1 lb of shredded mozzarella cheese to start with so you can just eyeball this layer as a quarter of the total amount of cheese you have.
14. Add another pasta layer.
15. Add another tomato/meat layer - there will one more layer of this mixture after this so put half of what you have left in this layer.
16. Put another layer of pasta down.
17. Put remaining cottage cheese mixture down evenly - this will be the final layer of this stuff so use it up.
18. Add another 1/4 pound of the mozzarella cheese.
19. Put down yet another layer of pasta.
20. Layer on the remaining tomato/meat sauce - this will be the last layer of this stuff so use it up.
21. Finally cover the previous layer with an even blanket of all of the 1/2 pound of mozzarella cheese you have left.
22. (In a nutshell the layers go like this - bottom to top: 1/3 of your tomato sauce (or a little less) pasta 1/2 of your cheese sauce 1/4 of your mozz. cheese pasta 1/2 of remaining tomato sauce pasta remainder of cheese sauce another 1/4 of your original amount of mozz. cheese pasta remainder of tomato sauce remainder of mozz. cheese.).

The same goes for garlic powder in lieu of fresh garlic. ~ Sauce can easily be frozen in individual or family-sized portions for use later on. Store in plastic containers or strong ziploc bags.,

7. Using tongs transfer chicken to serving platter and tent with foil to keep warm.  Remove and discard rosemary stem cloves and bay leaves.  Place skillet over high heat and bring sauce to boil.  Cook until sauce is reduced to about 1 1/2 to 1 1/4 C about 2 to 4 minutes.  Turn off heat and stir in rosemary leaves lemon juice and butter.  Taste for salt and pepper.

instructions, 1. If you are starting out with a fresh loaf cut off the crusts before letting it get stale. I soaked in milk instead of water. Squeeze out excess liquid and work it to a paste with your hands making sure there are no hard or large lumps.
2. Preheat oven to 450 deg. F. Put all ingredients into a very large bowl or roasting pan and mix thoroughly with your hands until everything is evenly incorporated.
3. Form into large balls. I took as much meat as fit comfortably inbetween my palms. The recipe said to make as large as a small baseball. I'm not sure how big that is I think mine were like tennis balls. One-third of the recipe made 16 meatballs for me.
4. Place on a rimmed baking sheet which has been coated with oil or with parchment paper - the cheese will stick to the pan. Bake for 30 minutes turning after 15 minutes.
5. Alternative cooking method: I cook meatballs in the slow cooker. They don't brown but I don't care since they will be covered with sauce. I use a liner for cleanup ease Just place the meatballs in the crockpot layering them on top of one another. Don't worry they won't turn into a giant meatloaf. I used a 5 qt slow cooker and it was nearly full. Cook on Low - mine took about four hours. Remember that time depends on how large and how full your crockpot is. If it's nearly full it will take longer. Less than half full will cook much more quickly.,

instructions, 1. 1. In a large bowl combine ground beef bread crumbs parsley Parmesan 1/4 teaspoon black pepper garlic powder and beaten egg. Mix well and form into 12 balls. Store covered in refrigerator until needed. Or you can prepared the meatballs and cooked them in the oven on a sheet pan for 20 minutes at 350*F. Then added them to the sauce or store covered in refrigerator until needed.
2. 2. In a large saucepan over medium heat saute onion and garlic in olive oil until onion is translucent. Stir lean the ground beef in tomatoes salt sugar and bay leaf. Cover reduce heat to low and simmer 90 minutes. Stir in tomato paste basil 1/2 teaspoon pepper and meatballs and simmer 30 minutes more. Serve.
3. My Note:   Sometime I also spiced up the meatballs with some stand-by italian spices (basic oregano etc.) and I upped the garlic (to taste). Also I used crackers (pounded or processed to crumbs) in place of bread crumbs and used a little less than called for. This made a very solid and yummy meatball  I was leary of making this without first pre-cooking the meatballs but this is by far the best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever made. The meatballs ended up a nice brown color they were not over cooked and I think putting them in before browning allowed some of the meat flavor to seep into the sauce. opted to use a combination of ground pork and ground beef (12 oz ground beef 4 oz ground pork) -instead of plain bread crumbs I used pre-seasoned breadcrumbs I increased the parmesan cheese to 4 oz. With the sauce instead of using 2 (28 oz) cans of whole tomatoes I used 1 (28 oz can) of whole tomatoes and then two smaller cans (14 oz) of crushed tomatoes. After simmering the sauce I ran half of it through the blender to make it smoother. I also added a small can of tomato sauce in addition to the tomato paste plus for added flavour I added 1 tsp italian seasoning 1/2 tsp basil and 1 tsp garlic powder. If you think or found the meatballs too dry may I suggest adding 1/2 cup of water or milk or tomato sauce to the meatballs? The eggs will bind them but not make them moister - adding liquid makes them exquisitely tender and juicy. Also if you want a lighter meatball substitute oatmeal for the breadcrumbs - measure it first then run it briefly in the blender so you won't have any big bits in the meatballs. I added 1.5 tsp oregano and 3 tsp basil; added 1 tsp seasoned salt 1 medium green pepper. I was very very happy with the sauce. Put it into a 250* oven while I cooked other stuff for about 2 hoursit was wonderful.
4. We do work long hours and don't have time at night to make a 2 hour meal so what I did was use my slow cooker. In the morning I sauteed my onion and garlic combined it with all the ingredience including half a can of tomato sauce for extra liquid since it tends to lose some in a slow cooker. Had my Son turn the cooker on low at his lunch so the sauce cooked about 6 1/2 hours. one hour before the sauce was done he put the meat balls inches We did end up adding the extra half a can of sauce just for liquid but the flavor was amazing. By using the slow cooker for us working cooks it was nice to come home to a ready made meal and good as this. Old YES! If you substituted turkey or other poultry for ground beef  --  you are never supposed to use breadcrumbs that type of meat is quite dry breadcrumbs only makes it worse!,

cuisine, European >> Italian >> Italian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Substitute 3 cups of your favorite store-bought frozen vegetable medley or packaged stir-fry mix for the fresh vegetables. Frozen vegetables should be thawed and the cooking time may vary depending on the size of the vegetable pieces.
2. Preheat a large 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet (see Chef's Notes) over high heat for 3 minutes. Spray with cooking spray (or add canola oil) to coat the surface of the skillet. The oil should be hot but not smoking. If the oil starts to smoke reduce the heat to medium-high.
3. Add the sliced steak in two batches so you don't overcrowd the pan. With a wooden or heat-resistant spatula constantly stir the steak in the pan allowing it to brown evenly about 3 minutes per batch. Remove each batch of steak to a serving platter.
4. Reduce the heat to medium-high. If the pan is dry add the 1/4 cup of water to the pan. Add the carrots red pepper and broccoli (or other vegetables of your choice) stirring them constantly in the pan until they are tender-crisp about 3 to 5 minutes.
5. Add the cooked steak (and its juices) back to the pan and remove it from the heat. Add the pesto and stir to coat the steak and vegetables evenly. Serve immediately.
6. Chef's Notes:
7. When you're using frozen ingredients simply pull them from the freezer in the morning and place them in the refrigerator so they're thawed by dinnertime. You can also thaw them in the microwave (according to your microwave's instructions) or in warm water right before cooking.
8. A cast-iron skillet is best for this kind of high-heat cooking because it retains heat very well and is virtually nonstick after it has been properly seasoned. A good 12-inch cast iron skillet is inexpensive and a great value: when treated properly it will last a lifetime.
9. Nonstick skillets are not recommended for high-heat cooking methods such as stir-frying. If you're using a nonstick skillet reduce the heat to medium. Cooking times may be longer and the meat may not brown as evenly.,

instructions, 1. Oil the inside of a large bowl and set aside. Combine the flour and salt in another large bowl and set aside. In a small bowl stir together 1/2 cup of the warm water the yeast and the sugar and let the mixture stand for 5 to 10 minutes until the yeast blooms and bubbles appear. Gradually add the yeast mixture to the flour mixing with your hands to combine. Gradually add the remaining water and finally the oil mixing until the dough is soft and sticky. You may need a little more water to make the dough soft and elastic. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic about 10 minutes working in more flour as needed. Or use an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. Shape the dough into a ball and place it in the oiled bowl. Turn it to coat with the oil cover it with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let it rise for about an hour until it is one and a half times its original size. Punch down the dough and let it rest for about 1 hour. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and roll it out with a rolling pin to the size and shape to fill your pizza pan. Let it rise in the pan approximately 20 minutes before adding toppings and cooking.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven 350°F.
2. Dice onions & crush garlic by first peeling and flattening with knife and then roughly chopping. Keeping garlic on cutting board and drizzling some olive oil and a sprinkle of salt take knife and crush together to make a paste. (Oil keeps it together and the salt acts as an abrasive). Divide onions and crushed garlic between two pans with oil one for the sauce and the other for the meatball base (and eventually to fry them in). Put both of them on moderate heat to sweat and slightly caramelize.
3. To the meatball base add a roughly chopped handful of flat leaf parsley.
4. Meanwhile (both onion mixes are still cooking) remove the crusts from the slices of bread and place in bowl with about 1 cup of milk. Put aside to allow the milk to soak into the bread.
5. Put water in large pot for cooking pasta on (bring to simmer and then salt it.).
6. Once you've put the water for the pasta on you should be able to turn the heat off the meatball base.
7. Allowing time for the meatball base to cool put the tomatoes through a food mill and add to the onions and garlic which have sweated down and started to caramelize. This will then cook down and thicken.
8. To make the meatballs place all of the base in a bowl (put pan back on heat with some olive oil for frying the meatballs) squeeze the soaked bread slightly and place in bowl with base along with egg a good grating of parmesan cheese stir and add ground meats and salt and pepper to taste. Incorporate together with hands. Shape into balls between golf ball and tennis ball in size.
9. Fry meatballs in 2 batches of about 8 (depending on pan size) to seal and caramelize them on both sides. You can place them straight from forming them into the pan once you have made about 8 then the first one will be ready to turn.
10. Place them in an oven proof pan all together and place 1/2 the tomato sauce in with the meatballs and place torn bits of fresh mozzarella on top and place uncovered in oven for 15 minutes to finish of cooking.
11. Add salt to simmering water cook pasta for 12 minutes al dente and drain add to pan with remaining tomato sauce drizzle extra virgin olive oil and a good amount of grated parmesan and stir to mix.
12. Plate up pasta with 2 meat balls and garnish with a couple of basil leaves and more grated parmesan.

instructions, 1. For the dough: Sift flour. Place into the bowl of a large capacity food processor fitted with a mixing blade.  Add remaining ingredients while blade is running.  Run processor until dough forms a ball (2-3 minutes) adding more flour if dough is sticky.  (You could also use a bread machine for the kneading process only or a dough mixer.)  Cover and set aside 10-15 minutes while you mix the filling and prepare for assembly.
2. For the filling:  Mix all ingredients in a bowl until smooth.
3. Using a pasta machine process dough according to manufacturer's instructions running dough through the widest setting 2-3 times and proceeding through each setting through #6.  Lightly dust with flour and layer between clean towels to prevent sticking and crusting.  Brush off all flour before forming ravioli in batches.
4. Using a ravioli attachment for your pasta machine or ravioli form follow manufacturer's instructions for forming ravioli.  Do not overfill -- a little filling may escape the pocket seal and that's okay but too much will weaken the seal and make a huge mess when you cook.
5. As ravioli are formed separate and let sit for 5-10 minutes on a lightly floured plate or tray while you make more ravioli.  Place ravioli in a single layer on a tray in the freezer to flash freeze for at least one hour in multiple trays lined with parchment paper (a must so they don't stick) as you make more ravioli.  As each tray-full is frozen remove from tray and place into a large freezer bag.  Do not vacuum seal.
6. To cook bring a large pot of water to mild boil.  Place up to 10 ravioli in the water at a time and stir very gently.  Ravioli are done when they float in about 2-3 minutes.  Remove ravioli with a slotted spoon or spider web and allow water to cling to them.  Place in a bowl and cover with a towel to keep warm.  Do not place in the oven.  Continue with batches of ravioli until the desired amount are cooked; keep in freezer until ready to cook.  Drain ravioli and serve immediately.
7. If a ravioli pops while cooking it will mess the water.  After that batch is done cooking empty the pot and clean it out and start with clean water.  If ravioli stick while cooking do not try to separate or they may tear open.
8. Serve with a rich tomato sauce a cream sauce or simple garlic olive oil if desired.  Top with freshly grated Parmesan if desired.  Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Note: I used a KitchenAid stand up mixer to prepare this recipe.
2. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a large mixing bowl stir it in and set aside until creamy about 10 minutes.
3. Stir in the flour and beat until smooth. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside to rise until puffy and bubbling about 30 minutes.
4. To the sponge in the large bowl add the water wine and 1/3 cup olive oil and stir to combine.
5. If mixing by hand whisk in 1 cup of flour and 2 teaspoons salt then beat in the rest of the flour until you have a dough that is very soft and very sticky.
6. Knead on a lightly floured board with the help of a dough scraper and 1 to 2 additional tablespoons of flour until the dough comes together nicely and is silky and shiny 6 to 8 minutes; it should remain soft but not wet.
7. If mixing with a mixer using the *paddle attachment* beat together the water wine 1/3 cup olive oil and sponge.
8. Add the flour and 2 teaspoons salt and mix until the dough comes together (it will be very soft).
9. Change to the *dough hook* and knead for 3 minutes at medium speed stopping once or twice to press the dough into a ball to aid in the kneading.
10. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead by hand using the 1 to 2 additional tablespoons of flour to finish 6 to 8 turns at most. It should remain soft but not wet.
11. Place the dough in a large lightly oiled container cover it tightly with plastic wrap and set aside until doubled about 1 hour.
12. The dough should be soft and full of air bubbles and should stretch easily.
13. Press it into a well-oiled (17-by-12-inch) jelly roll pan (I used parchment paper-fyi) dimple it well with your fingertips or knuckles (I used the end of a wooden spoon) cover with a tea towel and let rise until puffy and doubled about 45 minutes.
14. If the dough springs back before it is completely stretched set it aside to “relax” the dough for a few minutes then stretch again; the dough will stretch more easily after it is rested.
15. At least 30 minutes before you plan to bake heat the oven to 425 degrees with a baking stone inside on the lowest shelf.
16. Once again dimple the top of the dough with your fingertips or knuckles drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil so it pools in the little indentations and sprinkle with the remaining salt.
17. Place the pan directly on the stone and immediately reduce the temperature to 400 degrees. Place a shallow metal container of water on the floor of the oven to make steam.
18. Bake until the focaccia is golden (lift the bread to check underneath as well) 25 to 30 minutes (25 minutes for my loaf).
19. Immediately remove from the oven and cool briefly on a rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.,

19. *CHICKEN TESTS FOR DONENSS (per Washington Fryer Commission):No matter what method you use for cooking chicken the most accurate test for doneness is a meat thermometer. Since chicken is never ready to be served unless it is done always be sure it is completely cooked. Whole or bone-in chicken should reach an internal temperature of 180°F and boneless chicken should be cooked to 165°F.
20. Other indicators for doneness include:
21. 1) A fork or toothpick can be inserted with ease.
22. 2) The juices should be clear not pink.
23. 3) Bone joints move easily.,

instructions, 1. Method:
2. Assemble all of your ingredients before hand Then when the materials are ready first add the mint leaves into the food processor then add the garlic cloves. On top of that add the almonds then the cheese then the olive oil salt/pepper and lemon juice in that order. Pulse twice every second for about a minute and if not chopped up finely enough repeat.
3. Note: the pulsing action is done instead of holding it because if one were to hold the botton then bits of cheese and almond would accumulate under the blades and not get mixed in with the other ingredients. Pulsing quickly shakes the material off.

instructions, 1. Cook manicotti according to package directions; drain.  Set aside.  (Or don't and increase the sauce measurements.  If increasing the sauce measurements you may want to use a roaster or a deeper pan.).
2. To prepare tomato sauce:  In Dutch oven (or large heavy saucepan) add olive oil and 1 cup onions.  Cook over medium heat stirring constantly until onions are soft (5-8 minutes).   Add tomatoes reserved juice and all remaining sauce ingredients (tomato paste basil sugar 1/2 t salt and 1/4 t pepper).  Continue cooking stirring occasionally until sauce just comes to a boil (2-4 minutes).  Cover; reduce heat to low.  Continue cooking stirring occasionally 35 minutes.
3. Meanwhile to prepare filling:  in 10-inch skillet add sausage 1/4 cup onion and garlic.  Cook over medium heat stirring constantly until sausage is browned (10-12 minutes).  Drain off fat.  Add spinach.  Continue cooking stirring occasionally until spinach is soft (2-3 minutes).  Place sausage mixture in large bowl.  Cool 10 minutes.  Stir in 1/3 cup Parmesan eggs oregano and 1/4 t pepper.  Set aside.
4. To prepare bechamel sauce:  in 2-quart saucepan melt butter over medium heat.  Stir in flour until smooth and bubbly (1 minute).  Add milk whipping cream and pepper.  Continue cooking stirring occasionally until sauce thickens (5-8 minutes).
5. Heat oven to 375.  Divide filling between manicotti tubes using a small spoon to fill each tube with about 2 T of filling (I use my clean hands--think stuffing a roll of coins).  Place 1/4 cup tomato sauce on bottom of 13x9x2-inch baking pan (more if you don't boil the noodles and in a deeper pan).  Place filled tubes on top of tomato sauce.  Pour bechamel sauce over tubes.  Top with remaining tomato sauce.  Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  Bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until bubbly and cheese is melted.
6. **This is a great OAMC recipe.  Before cooking/prep day I would prepare the tomato sauce and sausage/spinach filling mixture and chill (I would prepare the tomato sauce anyway to serve as a pasta sauce--I could literally drink the stuff!).  Make the bechamel sauce the day of your big session.  Fill the tubes and prep the pans.  Cook 45 minutes (Covered!) wrap in foil and freeze.  On "eating day" cook at 375 until tubes are al dente (they probably already will be) and bubbly and cheese is melted.  I would keep it covered for most of the cooking time.  This is a very very rich recipe so I would serve with a salad of bitter greens tossed in a sharp vinaigrette.  It says it serves 8 but as I said the sauces are so rich that I can't really eat more than one tube so I would say it serves 14.,

instructions, 1. Cut 1/16" off the ends of the cucumbers and scrub very well (leaving the blossom end on can lead to spoilage).
2. Soak the cucumbers in ice water for a couple of hours.
3. When cucumbers are almost done soaking Mix the salt and water.
4. Sterilize or wash your giant pickle jar (about a gallon) from the food warehouse.  Make sure you have properly disposed of all the lousy pickles that use to be in it I Recommend your compost heap or the garbage. Wash the jar or sterilize it so it no longer stinks like the vinegar they used to make there inferior pickles.
5. Now it gets real easy.  Pack as many of your pickles into the jar as you can.  Use the rest for a salad or something.  stick in all the dill (you can chop it but it does not matter) all the garlic cloves all the seeds then stop and look at your beautiful jar. If you have the grape leaves stick them in at this time.  I don't ever use them but my buddy does.
6. Pour the salt water in the jar.  All the way up to the top minus an inch or a half inch or so.  If you are short water add some.
7. Tightly cover the jar with the lid that came on the giant pickle jar.  Cover it tightly as hard as you can turn stop then tighten again just to make sure.  Stand back and look at the beauty of what you have made.
8. Place jar UPSIDE down with a towel over it (to keep it dark) in a cool (65-58°F) place in your home.  Put a plate under the jar to see if it leaks.
9. The next day (24 hours later) check to see if the jar leaked.  If it did it means you didn't follow my instructions.  Tighten the lid (if needed) and TURN IT UPRIGHT cover it with the towel and ignore it. Walk away.
10. Leave in cool dark place for five days.  If you want to leave them for a full week more power to you.  Both time frames will result in a great authentic Kosher pickle.

instructions, 1. Get the spaghetti boiling in plenty of salted water.
2. Heat olive oil in pan over medium-high heat and fry the pancetta for 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
3. Beat the egg lightly using a fork in another bowl.
4. When the pasta is cooked drain it but put a bowl under the colander in order to retain some of the water; you may need that later.
5. Now return the pasta to the pan and stir in first the pancetta with the hot oil and then the beaten eggs. The egg will cook in the heat from the pasta but here is where the flair comes in; you need to stir the egg into the mix so that it cooks into a cream and not hundreds of pieces of tiny omelette.
6. Add the cheese and if the mixture is too dry stir in a little of the cooking water from the pasta (no more than a spoonful). Cook until the cheese just starts to melt and the egg is still creamy.
7. Serve with coarse-ground black pepper.,

instructions, 1. For the glaze:
2. Add the balsamic vinegar and Worcestershire to a small saucepan and simmer over medium heat until thickened and coats the back of a spoon 3 to 5 minutes.
3. For the dough:
4. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Grease 2 baking sheets with olive oil.
5. Prepare the pizza dough according to the recipe. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions.
6. On a floured work surface using a rolling pin roll each piece of dough into a circle. Place the circles onto the prepared baking sheets.
7. For the toppings:
8. Place 1/4 of the ricotta Parmesan mozzarella and tomatoes on the bottom half of each of the rounds. Season the filling with salt and pepper tear some basil leaves over the cheese and tomatoes and drizzle with a spoonful of the balsamic glaze.
9. Fold the dough rounds in half to resemble a half-moon shape covering the filling with the dough. Starting at one end of the half-moon begin to fold the dough over on itself pressing down as you go. Continue to fold the dough until you reach the end and then tuck the final end under and pinch it shut.
10. Brush the calzones with some more olive oil and with the tip of a knife make 2 slits in each calzone so the steam can escape.
11. Bake the calzones until the crust is golden and crisp about 15 minutes. (See Cook's Note*).
12. Simple Pizza Dough:
13. In a liquid measuring cup combine the warm water yeast and sugar. Allow the yeast to dissolve and bloom about 5 minutes. Once bloomed add the olive oil.
14. Meanwhile in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment combine the flour and salt. Stream in the water/yeast mixture and as the dough begins to come together switch to a dough hook attachment. Allow the dough to knead adding a bit more flour if needed so that the dough releases from the sides of the bowl 1 to 3 minutes. You should be able to touch the dough and not have the dough stick to your fingers. Once the dough has kneaded and has pulled away from the sides of the bowl remove the dough from bowl to a floured work surface and with floured hands continue to knead it by hand for 1 to 2 minutes. Then form the dough into a round ball and place it into a large bowl sprayed with nonstick spray. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let the dough rise in a warm area of your kitchen until it doubles in size 1 1/2 to 2 hours. After the dough has risen it is ready to be cooked however you'd like! (See Cook's Note**).
15. Tomato Sauce:
16. Heat a medium saucepan to medium-high. Add in the olive oil. Saute the onions until translucent about 5 minutes. Add in the tomatoes garlic sugar red pepper flakes and season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes on medium low. Season with salt and pepper and fold in the basil.
17. Cook's Notes:
18. * Cutting slits in the top of the calzone will prevent the calzone from leaking and let the steam escape. You can fill this calzone with whatever you like.
19. **This dough is wet dough keep bench flour at the ready and make sure to flour your hands when working with the dough. Trust your gut as a chef if the dough is to wet add more flour if it is too stiff add a little water. Sugar is used to feed the yeast which will help the dough to grow. Bread flour will give you a chewier texture because the flour has more gluten. You don't need to use a thermometer to get the water temperature it should just feel warm to the touch.,

instructions, 1. In a nonstick skillet saute' the pancetta until brown and crisp.  Remove from pan and drain on paper towels; set aside.
2. Put the pepper carrots celery onion mushrooms and garlic in a food processor; pulse until finely chopped.
3. Over a medium flame heat the olive oil and butter in a large deep saute' pan with a thick heavy bottom.  To the pan add the chopped vegetables and lemon zest saute' for 6 or 7 minutes - until the onions turn clear and the garlic starts to "dance".  Pour all ingredients into a large bowl; reserve for later.
4. Continuing to cook over a medium flame add the sausage links to the saute' pan breaking into bite-sized clumps with a fork while it cooks; stir often.  Cook until no longer pink.  Remove sausage from pan and drain on paper towels.  Meanwhile discard all but 1 tablespoon of the pan drippings and add the beef to the saute' pan.  Crumble with a fork to break the beef apart; stir often.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook until no longer pink.
5. Lower your flame to medium-low and return the sausage sauteed vegetables and pancetta to the saute' pan; gently stir together to blend.  Add the wine and simmer until the alcohol evaporates about 3 minutes. Add the milk allspice basil oregano and pepper. Simmer until milk thickens a little - around 3 or 4 minutes.
6. Stir in the tomatoes and  a 1/2 cup of their juice. When the sauce starts to boil reduce the heat so that it cooks at the barest simmer with just an occasional bubble or two. Cook uncovered for 3 hours turning down the heat if the sauce starts to scorch. If the sauce dries out before it is done add a laddle of the reserved tomato juice or the beef broth; and check the seasoning.
7. The sauce will improve steadily as it cooks and if you have the time simmer it longer - many Italian cooks suggest that it be simmered for 6 hours adding the tomato juice or broth as necessary. When this bolognese sauce is done it should be rich and thick.
8. Cook's Tip:  The sauce can be stored in an airtight container and refrigerated for several days or frozen for several months. Warm over low heat before serving.
9. Cook's Tip:  Try using all chopped veal or lamb for a stronger flavor.,

instructions, 1. MAKING THE DOUGH: In a mixing bowl dissolve sugar and salt into the lukewarm water.
2. Add yeast corn oil and a small amount of the flour.
3. Mix until you have a thick batter then add the rest of the flour and continue mixing until combined.
4. Knead until the dough comes together into a smooth ball then STOP. DON’T OVER-KNEAD. Total mixing/kneading time should be no more than 2 - 3 minutes (This step can also be done in a mixer with a dough hook in 1 - 2 minutes. If it looks smooth but doesn’t form a ball just take it off the hook and form into a ball).
5. Place the dough in a bowl (or keep it in your mixing bowl) lightly oil/spray the dough ball.
6. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm place. Let the dough rise for 1 to 2 hours (or until dough has doubled).
7. After the rise you can use the dough immediately OR punch down the dough and let it rise again until you’re ready to use the dough OR place it into a plastic zip-top bag and into the refrigerator for 6 to 24 hours.
8. ASSEMBLING YOUR PIZZA AND BAKING: Place a pizza stone in the bottom rack of your oven and place a sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil across the top rack. Preheat your oven to 500 degrees (F). It should take about 40 minutes to an hour to preheat your stone so you may want to do this while your dough is rising. If you refrigerated your dough take it out of the fridge while your oven is preheating.
9. Using a fine mesh strainer over a bowl drain any excess liquid from your tomatoes if necessary.
10. Lightly grease the bottom (not the sides) of your pan with oil or high-heat cooking spray.
11. Press out the dough in the pan from center to the edge as flat and even as possible. Pinch up the sides into a paper-thin lip about 1 to 1-1/2 inches high.
12. Lightly press sliced mozzarella cheese into the dough overlapping the slices until the entire bottom is covered (If making an all-cheese pizza you can add extra cheese if you want then skip to the part where you add the tomatoes).
13. Add the Italian sausage: For traditional patty add small bits of sausage on top of the cheese connecting the bits together into a loose web until the entire bottom is covered.
14. Add any other ingredient that you want to protect from burning.
15. THE PART WHERE YOU ADD THE TOMATOES: With a large spoon or ladle top the pizza with the crushed tomatoes spreading the sauce from the center out to the edge until the other ingredients are completely covered with sauce. You should need between 14 and 16 oz of tomatoes.
16. Sprinkle grated Romano (and/or Parmesan) Cheese over the top of the sauce.
17. Turn oven down to 450 and place the pizza pan directly on top of the pizza stone on the lower rack.
18. Bake for approximately 35 minutes. If your crust or toppings start to char on top place a loose sheet of aluminum foil over the top of the pizza for the remaining baking time.
19. Remove from oven let pizza rest for 5 minutes then cut & serve on a real plate with a knife & fork.,

3. Prepare Pesto: In a blender or food processor whirl to a paste the basil parmesan or romano cheese and olive oil.
4. Stir in pine nuts.
5. Set aside.
6. Cut cheesecloth squares about 10-12" square to line custard cups (It needs to be able to cover the bottom go up the sides and still have some to fold over the top of the torta).
7. If you use the really loose weave stuff (standard grocery store cheesecloth) you'll need two pieces per custard cup.
8. Moisten the cheesecloth with water wring dry and lay two sheets out flat on top of each other.
9. Smoothly line your custard cups with the cheesecloth (this can be a bit tricky but it doesn't have to be perfectly smooth).
10. With your fingers or a flexible rubber spatula spread a thin layer (about 1/2 inch) of the cheese mixture in a lined custard cup.
11. Cover with 1/4-/12 inch pesto.
12. Put another layer of cheese.
13. If you can do another layer of pesto and cheese so you end up with 3 cheese layers and 2 pesto layers.
14. Two layers of cheese and one of pesto works if that's the way it comes out.
15. Fold the ends of the cheesecloth neatly over the top of the torta and press down lightly with fingers.
16. Repeat with remaining cheese and pesto.
17. I get 5 large custard cups or 6 small cups plus one large cup from this quantity of ingredients.
18. Chill until tortas are firm when pressed (at least 2 hrs I usually just let them go overnight).
19. Remove from custard cups by gently pulling on the cheesecloth around the edges.
20. Remove the cheesecloth and wrap the torta tightly in two layers of saran wrap.
21. Seal in sandwich size ziplock freezer bags and place in freezer.
22. To serve: Remove from freezer and thaw (overnight in frig works well).
23. Bring to near room temp and srve with sliced baguettes and crisp raw vegetables.
24. Variation: For a large party do one massive torta in a charlotte mold loaf pan or a clean clay flowerpot.
25. You'll end up with 7-8 layers of each filling in this one.
26. I wouldn't freeze this size but it will keep in the frig for up to 5 days.,
