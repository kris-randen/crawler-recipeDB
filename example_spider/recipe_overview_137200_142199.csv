instructions, 1. NOTE: My mother cooks this with 2 cups water and mashes the potatoes and cabbage after cooking before adding the bacon. Though this tastes good it does not look very tempting. :).
2. FOR CABBAGE: Remove outer dark or dry cabbage leaves cut cabbage into eights and cut the core away.Cut cabbage crosswise in 1/8 inch strips. Wash and drain cabbage removing any thick "ribs".
3. Wash peel and cut potatoes in 3/4 inch dice.
4. Put potatoes salt cumin bay leaf and water in a large pot cover and boil potatoes for 15 minutes until just tender.
5. Add cabbage stir thoroughly and boil over medium heat about 7 - 10 minutes stirring occasionally. You want the cabbage to have some bite and most of the liquid to have cooked off. You might need to add a little hot water if all liquid has cooked off before the cabbage is done.
6. Depending on the size of your pot it might be necessary to add the cabbage in batches. Cover the pot between batches and let reduce volume before adding rest of cabbage.
7. FOR BACON MIXTURE: When potatoes are almost done heat oil in a small pan over medium heat fry bacon until pale golden add onions and cook until bacon is crisp and onions golden about 12 minutes. Remove from heat and pour off most of the fat.
8. TO ASSEMBLE: The cabbage should be only moist. If there is too much liquid raise heat and cook it off stirring often. Remove from heat add cayenne lemon juice and most of bacon mixture. Stir to mix and adjust seasoning.
9. To serve: Top cabbage with rest of bacon mixture (and parsley)as garnish.,

time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. The most important part of cooking with an iron skillet is to heat the pan first without any fat inside.  When it is really hot add your chicken fat ) shmaltz.   Turn down the heat to simmer.  I play with the gas burner while cooking up and down according to the heat in the pan.  If you notice the oil burning turn down the heat.  I immediately add the chopped onions after I added  the oil.  Keep stirring with a wooden spoon. The onions will turn translucent.  If there is not enough shmaltz oil in the pan add a little vegtable oil and continue cooking the onions.  Try not to overcook the onions.  Take them out before they turn brown.  While this is going on rinse the livers under cold water and drain.  After the onions are removed from the pan clean the pan with a slotted spoon of any dark pieces of onion.  Then add a little more shmalltz to the pan and some livers.  Do not crowd the pan.  Cook livers one pan at a time.  I constantly keep turning the livers.  I cut into the liver to see if it is done.  It should be cooked all the way thru just not burned.  Next combine the livers and the onions in a bowl.  In the cuisinart fitted with the blade on the bottom place a small amount of the ingredients and pulse until you like the consistancy.  I like it soft like a pate.  Do this until all of the liver and onions are finely mashed.  I then combine the pate with the hand chopped onions.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  I like the pate to be slightly more peppery.  It looks nice to garnish with the extra chopped raw onions and if you like some chopped hard boiled eggs.  During passover you can eat this with matzah or serve with crackers.  Place in refrigerator immediately after preparation for at least a few hours in a sealed container.  I enjoy the liver after it is removed from the frig for 20 minute  Happy Cooking!,

2. While oven is heating pour all the milk into blender and set on the lowest speed. Just let it run the more bubbles the milk has the puffier the pancake will be.
3. When oven is hot put butter in large cast iron skillet and set into the oven until the butter is bubbly in the pan.
4. Crack eggs in a separate cup and pour one at a time into blender (while it's still blending).
5. Pour in the flour and the vanilla (if desired) and once it's mixed pour immediately into hot cast iron skillet.
6. Cook for 20 minutes.
7. Now we're high altitude at 5000ft -- so if your lower you may need to cook it longer. Just watch it and when the edges are browned and it's all puffy your ready to roll.
8. Eat it just like any pancake or some I know like it with lemon juice and powdered sugar. But either way you'll love it! =D.
9. Note: If you want to show it off you'll have to make sure you have an audience as soon as it comes out of the oven because it begins to collapse as it cools. It will keep some of its shape but the real 'pow' is first thing out of the oven.,

2. Combine the yeast with warm water (110 F). Note: If you're using compressed yeast the water needs to be at 85°F.
3. Combine the milk butter sugar salt and cardamom; cool to lukewarm.
4. Stir in 2 c of flour; beat well. Add the softened yeast and egg; beat well.
5. Stir in the fruits peels and nuts.
6. Add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough.
7. Turn out on a slightly floured surface. Knead for about 8-10 minutes or until smooth and elastic.
8. Place in a greased bowl turning once to grease the entire surface of the the dough.
9. Cover and let rise in a warm place for about 1 1/2 hours or until double.
10. Punch down; turn out on a lightly floured surface.
11. Divide into 3 equal parts.
12. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
13. Roll each of the 3 sections into a 10 x 16 inch rectangle.
14. Without stretching fold the long side over to within 1 inch of the opposite side; seal the edge (you can pinch it together or brush with a bit of beaten egg or warm milk if you wish).
15. Place on a greased baking sheet.
16. Cover and let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until almost double again.
17. Preheat the oven to 375 and bake for 15 - 20 minutes or until golden brown.
18. Let cool slightly and place onto large pieces of wax paper plastic wrap platters etc each loaf on it's own separate surface.
19. You don't want to get the glaze everywhere.
20. Glaze:
21. Note: You can easily half the glaze. My family doubled it because of our huge sweet tooth. (It's really pretty too. It has a daisy on it. :D).
22. Combine the sugar water and the butter. Brush or pour over the stollen.
23. It will be runny at first so you may have to spoon any that gooped onto your platter or counter back up onto the loaf.
24. You can leave it as it is or decorate  it however you wish.
25. I always make pretty flowers out of bits of fruit and cherries or sliced almonds. Such as a flower made with slices of almonds for the petals bits of candied cherries for the center and citron or green candied cherries for the leaves and stems. Very pretty.
26. Let the loaves sit until the glaze has set (it will still be slightly squishy to the touch) and then wrap in plastic wrap to keep them fresh until it's time to serve them.
27. That's another reason we add so much glaze since it helps keep the bread moist.
28. Place the loaves in a cool dark place or they even freeze well.
29. I put the serving size at 24 which would be 8 generous slices per loaf but you will probably get more out of it.
30. Note: Yeast equivalents are One package = 2 1/4 teaspoons = 1/4 ounce = 1 compressed cake.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350°F  Cover the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with wax paper then cover it with a fine dusting of powdered sugar.
2. For the batter mix eggs and sugar thoroughly.  A little at a time add sifted flour cocoa and salt mixing slowly by hand.  (If you mix with an electric mixer the dough may come out tough)   Place the batter in the prepared springform pan and bake 20 minutes.  Test for doneness with a toothpick and notice that the cake will begin pulling away from the sides of the springform when done.  (The original recipe calls for 30-40 minutes which always burned my cake).
3. Remove sides of springform.  Place a dinner plate over the top of the cake then flip it upside down carefully.  This will put the flat part of the cake on top--looks prettier.  Remove bottom of springform and wax paper.  Cut the torte in half horizontally with a sharp bread knife.  The top half can be lifted with two knives to a plate and set aside.   Wash all fresh cherries and let dry well.  Set aside 8 fresh cherries.   Remove the stems and pits from the remainder of the cherries then chop them into little bits with a knife.  Press them in a colander to remove the juice and set the juice aside.
4. Drizzle a tablespoon of Kirschwasser evenly over each of the cake halves with a tablespoon (or use a spritzer if you have one).  Then place the chopped cherries over the bottom cake half.  Mix whipping cream with electric mixer.  Mix 4 tablespoons Kirschwasser and up to 8 tablespoons of sugar depending on taste into whipping cream.  (If you don't have Kirschwasser you may use 2 tablespoons of the reserved cherry juice.) On bottom cake half with cherries  lay 1/3 of the whipped cream.
5. Gently replace top half of cake over bottom half.   Gently spread remaining whipping cream evenly over top and sides of cake to cover.  If you wish use a pastry bag with a star nozzle to make 8 little mounds of whipped cream on top of cake around the edges upon which you can place the 8 reserved cherries.
6. Optional:  you may grate 50 grams of chocolate and cover the sides of the cake with it.
7. Chill cake in refrigerator to firm up whipped cream frosting.,

instructions, 1. Peel the potatoes. Slice them very thinly.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a non-stick pan (a stainless steel pan will do too).
3. Lay half of the potatoes in a spiral form in the pan so that they overlap each other like the petals of a rose. Make sure that the middle of the spiral is closed. Cook at medium heat for about 8–10 minutes. Do not stir them around. The starch of the potatoes should keep them together. Also check the edges of the potatoes. They shouldn't get brown to fast. (Adjust heat accordingly).
4. Salt and pepper to taste.
5. While the potatoes are browning slice the ham and the cheese into 1 inch strips.
6. First layer half of the cheese strips across the top of the potato rosette then layer the ham. Finish off by topping the ham with the rest of the cheese. (The grandmotherly cook said "the cheese acts as glue and helps hold the rosette together).
7. Cover the potato rosette with the other half of the potatoes.
8. Next take a flat plate that fits into the pan place it over the potato rosette so that the bottom of the plate is facing upwards carefully turn the pan over holding plate and pan so that the potato rosette is now on the right side of the plate. (It sounds complicated but is easy). Be careful and protect your hands with oven mitts as some hot oil could spill out.
9. The rosette should still be intact. Using a spatula carefully slide the potato rosette back into the pan.
10. Brown another 10 minutes or until the potatoes are done.
11. Serve hot with a side of green salad.,

instructions, 1. This dough is a basic sweet dough.  I use it for cinnamon rolls and monkey bread as well.  Combine the milk yeast and sugar in a mixing bowl.  Let stand for 2 minutes to proof the yeast.  Add the egg butter nutmeg salt and half of the flour.  Mix until smooth then beat for 2 minutes.  Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough.
2. Turn dough onto floured surface and knead just enough to smooth the dough and thoroughly combine ingredients. Kneading makes gluten so don't overdo it or you'll lose tenderness.  Place in a greased bowl cover and let rise until doubled about 1 1/2 hours.
3. To assemble punch the dough down and divide in half.  Roll the dough into discs and spread into the greased pans.  Cover and let rise in the pan until doubled about 1 1/2 hours.  Meanwhile mix the sugars and cinnamon in a bowl.  Canned peach slices are usually too thick.  Slice them as necessary to get reasonably thin pieces about 1/2 inch.
4. When the cakes are risen brush the dough with melted butter and sprinkle with a mixture of sugars and cinnamon.  Spread peaches over the top covering as much dough as possible and then sprinkle again with the sugar and cinnamon mix.  You want a good thick coating of sugar to glaze the top.
5. Bake in a 350-degree Fahrenheit oven for 20-25 minutes.  The coffee cakes should be golden around the edges but somewhat pasty where risen between the peach slices.  Let cool for at least 15 minutes.,

instructions, 1. WARNING: This part has to be done the day before you want to serve. Stir together all of the marinade ingredients in a nonreactive bowl. Place the roast in a nonreactive container (or large ziplock bag) and marinate overnight. The day before is also a good time to make the gingersnaps if like me you are using homemade.
2. The next day: Remove the meat and pour the marinade in the slow cooker. In a large skillet quickly brown all sides of the meat in the canola oil. Add the meat into the slow cooker and turn on low for 6 hours.
3. During the last hour or so of cooking time: Start to make the dumplings. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. In a large bowl combine the cooled mashed potatoes and salt and the egg. Stir in the baking powder and add the flour in 1/2 cup increments until the it resembles a dough and the mixture holds its shape when molded (roughly 3 cups). Form into 2 to 4 inch balls. They should be able to hold their shape but not be too floury. Drop them into the water. They should sink then rise to the surface when cooked through. Set aside.
4. During the last 1/2 hour of cooking time: Skim off any visible fat that may have risen to the top then add the gingersnaps and turn the heat to high.
5. After the time is up shred the meat a bit with a fork or break it into pieces. Serve hot with dumplings on the side.,

instructions, 1. Mix all spices and onion in a ziploc bag.
2. Generously oil both sides of meat and place in bag.
3. Zip up bag shake around to coat chops well. Remove excess air from bag reseal and place in the refrigerator for 3-5 days.
4. Every day gently knead bag to mix up spices a little.
5. After 3-5 days remove chops from bag discard bag containing spices and onion.
6. Cook chops on the grill and serve on buttered hard rolls.
7. Things I have learned by making these:
8. You can mix up the dry spice blend in advance (Except the fresh parsley) and keep in a sealed jar. Typically I use it within a month.
9. The spice amounts may seem excessive but they are correct.
10. Do not use chops thicker than 1/2 inch or they are too tough.
11. I oil the chops up really good and even add a tablespoon or 2 to the bag to make it a little more liquidy (is that a word?).
12. When you remove them from the bag they are messy.
13. The spices stick pretty thick to the chop. That's ok grill them like this and if you like you can scrap a little seasoning off after grilling.
14. When I use Hot Hungarian Paprika DS likes to put ranch dressing on his sandwich.
15. Grilling does them more justice than broiling and only takes about 10 minutes.,

2. In a large measuring cup stir the flour into the reserved liquid (or 1 1/2 cups water) whisking briskly with a fork until smooth.

4. Cook and stir constantly (I use a wire whisk or wooden spoon) over medium-high heat until mixture comes to a boil. When mixture comes to a boil continue to cook and stir on medium-high heat for 3 minutes more (at this stage you may want to add a touch more of water or flour depending on how thick you want the sauce to be).
5. Add the green beans lemon zest salt and pepper and the fresh parsley (except one tablespoon snipped parsley for garnish); stir to combine. Reduce heat to medium stir occasionally until beans are hot (8 to 10 minutes).
6. Remove from heat. Finish with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and garnish with snipped parsley. Serve immediately.
7. If making beans ahead to serve later:

instructions, 1. NOTE: The jelly topping is optional and many people don't like it because it is rather flavorless. It helps to fix the berries in place and keep them fresh longer. You can leave it completely or use a store-bought raspberry jelly heated until liquid  and pour this over fruit.
2. Grease round 11 in (28 cm) form and dust with flour or fine dry breadcrumbs.

7. With a rubber spatula carefully fold egg whites and flour into egg yolks just until blended.
8. Pour batter in form and bake in the lower third of the oven for 18-22 minutes until golden yellow. Let rest in the turned-off oven for another 15 minutes.
9. Remove cake from form and let cool completely. You can prepare ahead until this step and keep well wrapped cake for a day or freeze.
10. For jelly (optional see note on top) soak gelatin in 2 Tbs cold water for 10 minutes. Heat over low heat until liquid. Add 2 Tbs sugar and rest of water and heat stirring until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and cool until it is just pourable (20-30 minutes).
11. For topping whip the cream with 1 Tbs sugar until stiff*(for stabilizing cream see note at the bottom). Put 1/4 of cream aside for decoration and spread rest evenly on cake.
12. Arrange raspberries on top of cream. Pour jelly over fruit. Let jelly set for 30 minutes. Garnish cake with leftover whipped cream.
13. Serve immediately cut into 12 wedges.
14. NOTE: If you can't serve it right away stabilize cream before assembling the cake:
15. Soak 1 teaspoon gelatin 10 minutes in 2 Tbs cold water. Heat until just dissolved. Let cool until barely warm. Stir in about 1/4 cup whipped cream. Fold this quickly but carefully into the  rest of the cream (volume will deflate somewhat).,

instructions, 1. For the filling: In a large pan bring the apples to a simmer you have to add a little amount (about 2 tbsp) of water just to stop them from burning at the beginning.
2. Stirring occasionally continue to simmer until they start to fall apart approx 10 minutes. You want to keep most of the chunks and not cook them so long that you have applesauce.
3. Take of the heat and allow to cool completely.
4. Stir in all other ingredients adding more or less sugar to your liking. The mix should still be a little tart as the sweetness of the crust and the sweetness of the whipped cream will make up for it.
5. For the crust: In a large bowl mix the butter and sugar using in electric mixer until well combined and creamy.
6. Add the egg and continue to mix until you have a soft fluffy mix.
7. Using the dough hooks on your mixer beat in the flour and baking powder bit by bit until well incorporated.
8. You might need to chill the dough a little to be able to roll it out.
9. On a floured surface roll out the dough with a floured rolling pin quite thin about 2-3mm.
10. Take a 10 1/4 inch spring form and cut out two circles one to fit the bottom and another one that will eventually cover the top.
11. Place one of the dough circles on the bottom of your greased spring form and prick in an couple of places with a fork.
12. Bake in a preheated oven (200°C/400°F) for 10 minutes.
13. Remove from oven and using the left-over bits of dough cover the sides of the pan all the way up.
14. Carefully place the filling inside and spread evenly to fill the pan. If it doesn't fill most of it just chop another apple or two and spread them over the top they'll cook in the oven.
15. Now comes the most tricky bit and I always ask somebody to lend me another pair of hands if I can. Carefully lift the other circle of dough you cut out earlier and place it over the top. If you do this on your own it's quite difficult to get it on without ripping but with four hands it's a lot easier. Otherwise try loosely rolling it and the un-rolling it on top of the filling.
16. Using a small knife just loosen the top of the sides and fold over onto the 'lid' crimping it shut. Don't worry if you haven't got much dough to fold and crimp there shouldn't be a lot.
17. Return the cake to the oven an bake for approx 50-60 minutes.
18. After 35-45 minutes of the total baking time when the top is starting to become golden briefly take the cake out of the oven and top with little knobs of butter and sprinkle with sugar.
19. Quickly return to the oven and bake for the remaining 15 minutes the cake should be a rich golden colour but not brown.
20. Remove from oven. Carefully cut around the outside of the pie with a long thin knife and allow to cool before removing the ring of the spring form. Otherwise the hot weight of the apples will cause the crust to tear around the side.
21. When completely cool cut into wedges and serve with a generous helping of whipped cream.,

2. Mix the last four wet ingredients together in large separate bowl. Blend well.
3. On low speed on your mixer add dry ingredients in three separate batches. After the last batch is added mix about five minutes more using a spatula to clean the sides of the bowl from time to time.
4. Preheat oven 350*.
5. Spray Pam on all sides and bottom of 9X13 pan. Sprinkle a little flour over the Pam to prevent batter from sticking.
6. Bake about 45-50 minutes in the middle rack of your oven. If you touch the middle of the cake and the dent comes back up the cake is done or insert toothpick and if it comes out clean it is done. There will be a slight crispyness on the edges. This cake freezes well.
7. Cool for at least 10 minutes.
8. Note: You may use muffin pans and fill a 1/4 measuring cup. Make sure you use Pam and flour in the muffin cups  before you fill. Bake about 15 minutes. Makes about 36.

instructions, 1. Place the flour in the large bowl. Create a "crater" in the flour. Place the sugar and the yeast (if using fresh yeast crumble it into the crater).
2. While stirring with the fork add the lukewarm water. Mix until the fluid is thick and creamy. You want to leave a wall of flour around the fluid.
3. Cover the bowl with a well fitting lid a large plate or a clean freshly ironed tea towel. Place in a warm draft free area for 15 minutes. Tip: I fill a smaller bowl with very warm water and set the big bowl on top of it. This helps the yeast activate if your kitchen is cold or drafty.
4. After 15 minutes uncover the large bowl. The fluid should be frothy or bubbly with a yeasty smell. If it isn't then the yeast did not activate properly. You will have to start again. (If using the second bowl set the second bowl aside).
5. Add the butter the salt and the baking powder. Mix until well blended using a mixer or a wooden spoon.
6. Then knead the dough for 15 minutes. The dough should feel smooth and silky. If it is sticky knead in a little flour at a time (appx. 1 tablespoon at a time). If it is too dry then add some soft butter (appx. 1 teaspoon at a time). Do not add more water.
7. Cover the dough again with the lid the plate or the towel. Leave in a warm draft free place to rise. (Again you can set the mixing bowl on top of the smaller bowl. Just remember to put fresh warm water in the smaller bowl). Leave until the dough has doubled in size approximately 25–40 minutes.
8. In a large pot bring the water to a boil. Add the baking soda. Turn down to simmer.
9. Uncover the dough. (If using the second bowl set the second bowl aside) Punch down the dough and knead it for about 5 minutes. Cut into 10 equal pieces.
10. Lay out a piece of parchment paper or set out the large wooden cutting board to use as a work space.
11. Take a piece of dough roll out into a long snake form. The middle should be slightly thicker then the ends.
12. Make the tips meet (you will now have a U form with an open loop ). Twist the string of dough twice around itself. Form a kringle by braiding one tip of dough over the loop and the other tip under the loop. Place on baking sheet. Repeat with the other pieces of dough.
13. Take the baking sheet to the stove. One at a time slip the kringle into the simmering water. Turn over and return to baking sheet. Repeat with the other kringles.
14. Sprinkle the kringles with course salt.
15. Turn off stove. Cover baking sheet with a clean freshly ironed towel. Place over the large pot or in a warm non-drafty place. Leave for about 15 minutes or until the kringles have doubled in size.
16. Place the vegetable steamer in the wok. Fill the bottom of the wok with water. It should be not come through the vegetable steamer.
17. Place as many kringles on the steamer as you can (5 worked for me). Cover the wok with the lid. Turn on to high till the water boils then turn down to medium-low. Steam the kringles for about 20 minutes until they have a golden brown pretzel color. Then they are done and the second batch can be steamed.You will have to add water to the wok occasionally so DO NOT LEAVE THE WOK UNATTENDED AT THE STOVE.
18. Best served warm but I do like them at room temperature too.,

2. Now add the rest of the ingredients including the juice you reserved from the beans to this and process until forms a dough.
3. Separate the dough into an even 7 sections and roll them into hot dog shapes with your hands approximately 5 inches long and 3/4 inch thick. Use the first one to gauge the size of the other ones. Create 7 5 inch X 8 inch parchment paper sheets to roll the hot dogs inches Roll them up into the paper and pinch the ends shut. Place in a steamer for 45 minutes. You can make your own steamer if you don't have one by placing a stainless steel colander into a large pot with water in the bottom and a lid on top. And you would cook them on medium to low heat. Bring water to a complete boil before placing the hot dogs in the colander. Make sure you don't put too much water in the bottom of the pot so it doesn't wet the hot dogs.
4. After cooking let rest 10 minutes. If the hot dogs are stacked on top of each other switch them around in the middle of cooking. Use the remaining beans for a chili dog.
5. These hot dogs can be frozen and microwaved for 1 minute while still frozen to heat.

instructions, 1. Put 1 kg flour in a very large bowl make a crater add about a tablespoon of sugar and the yeast into the crater and stir in the milk to make a creamy starter dough (You won't stir in all the flour just some of it to make a thick "sauce". Cover and keep warm for 20 minutes.
2. Mix the rest of the sugar with the eggs the vanilla bean the lemon zest and the salt until creamy. Combine with the starter mixture. Cover and let rise in a warm area for about 40 minutes.
3. Knead the 400 g of butter and the other 200 grams of flour with the spices. Combine with the risen dough kneading thoroughly. Let rise for another 30 minutes.
4. Knead in the chocolate chips or chopped chocolate. Let rise about another 30 minutes.
5. Divide the dough into 2 parts and form a long log out of each. Roll this a little flat so that it is about a an inch and a half or two inches thick making a long rectangle. Fold a third of the long side towards the middle. Repeat with the other part of dough.
6. Place on a baking sheet covered with parchement. You will need to separate the loaves. Do this by rolling up baking parchement loosely and covering it with aluminum foil placing it between the two loaves. I recommend doing this to the outside of the loaves two otherwise the loaves will spread and not rise properly. You could also use a special form but these are hard to get. Let rise for another 20 minutes. The Stollen should double in size.
7. Bake at 200° C for 1 hour to 1 hour and 20 minutes.
8. While the stollen is still warm melt the 150 g of butter. Spoon over one stollen and sift the powdered sugar over it covering it completely. Repeat with the other one. Wrap tightly in aluminum foil and store for two weeks before eating so that the flavor develops. (You can eat it right away if you'd like).,

instructions, 1. Combine the flour eggs and salt in a bowl and mix to   make a pasta dough.
2. Then add a little water and knead   until it has a firm but elastic consistency.
3. To make the filling melt the butter in a skillet and   fry the bacon with the onions until both are quite   translucent.  Combine the bacon mixture with the   sausage meat.   Moisten the hard roll in water press dry and put   through the meat grinder (better than the food mill or   food processor) along with the bacon mixture cooked   spinach ground meat or smoked farm sausage leftover   roast etc.  Then fold in the eggs parsley and   seasonings; mix together.
4. The filling should be very   spicy indeed.
5. On a board that has been sprinkled with flour roll   out the dough into rectangular sheets (about twice as   wide as you want your 'Maultaschen' to be).  Take a   tablespoon measure and put little dabs of filling at   equally spaced 3-inch intervals all down the middle of   one side of the sheet of dough.
6. Mix together the egg   and canned milk and apply it to the spaces in between   the outer edge and the fold line.  Fold the plain half   of the sheet of dough over to cover the filling press   down firmly on the spaces around the little packets of   filling and use a pastry wheel or knife to separate   the packets into 3-inch square or diamond- shaped   'Maultaschen'.
7. The process is similar to making   ravioli.
8. Cook thoroughly in beef stock or boiling   salted water for about 10 to 15 minutes depending   upon the size of the 'Maultaschen'.
9. They'll bob up to   the surface when they're done; remove them with a   slotted spoon and allow to drain.
10. Serving suggestions:   Cut an onion or two into half-rings fry in butter   until golden brown and empty the contents of the   skillet over the 'Maultaschen' on the serving dish.
11. Serve with slippery potato salad or a mixed green   salad.,

instructions, 1. Beat eggs one at a time in the mixing bowl until light and fluffy.
2. Add water and beat again. You will see the mixture rise and air bubbles floating on top. This is essential and excellent. When you see this it means that air has worked its magic by being incorporated into the mixture and thereby it has risen on beating.
3. Add a little of the German chocolate cake mix at a time and mix well. You can start with the lowest mixing power level of your hand mixer and gradually go from 1 to 2 to 3(maximum power).
4. Fold in the Nesquik chocolate powder and cocoa powder. Mix as above.
5. Add the remaining German chocolate cake mix and mix as above.
6. Now add the orange juice and mix as above.
7. Next add the raspberry and almond essences alongwith the olive oil and mix as above.
8. Make sure you have mixed thoroughly and you must remember to scrape the mixture remaining on the sides of the mixing bowl.
9. Now your mixture is ready to bake.
10. Bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean(about 50-55 minutes).
11. If you end up having extra cake batter you can prepare muffins.
12. I had extra batter and prepared 4 muffins.
13. Bake the muffins at 180C for 20 minutes in a pre-heated oven until a knife inserted in the middle of each muffin comes out clean.
14. Allow to cool in the muffin tray for 10 minutes.
15. Invert onto a wire rack and allow to cool completely.
16. Likewise allow the cake to cool for 10 minutes and then invert on to a wire rack and allow to cool completely.
17. Slice and serve or store wrapped in aluminium foil in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
18. You may use an icing of your choice I think whipped cream mixed with some chocolate frosting and sugar would be wonderful.

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
2. In a Dutch oven  over medium-low heat cook the bacon crisp to render the fat. Once the bacon is cooked remove from pan and set aside. Reserve the rendered bacon fat in pan.
3. Begin prepping the meat: If the meat is too thick you may butterfly to make thinner.
4. Salt and pepper the steaks and lay flat on a large cutting board. Pound to tenderize. Flatten to 1/2" if possible. Flip & pound the other side. Repeat as necessary to ensure  thinness.  I like to cover the meat over & under with a piece of clear plastic wrap to minimize messiness while tenderizing the meat.
5. Brush the top side of the slices with enough mustard just to coat.
6. Spread with dill pickle relish and bacon / lardons.
7. Sprinkle HALF the onion on top of the pickle relish.
8. Starting at the short end roll the meat up jellyroll style and secure with kitchen twine in 3-4 places. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
9. Reheat the bacon fat to the  Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the meat and brown all sides of the meat.
10. Remove the meat from the pan. Add oil if necessary and add the remaining onion carrot and celery; cook until tender about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute.
11. Deglaze the pan with the wine. Scrape up any bits off the bottom of the pan  then add in the canned tomatoes with their juice. Add the beef stock.
12. Nestle the meat back into the pan bring to a simmer cover and bake until the meat is tender about 90 minutes. Turn the meat once halfway through cooking. If you need to add a bit more stock do so.  The sauce will be on the thick side and full of the veggies.
13. Let rest for 5-10 minutes. Do not remove the twine just yet.
14. Slice meat  1" thick  with the twine in place or not. It will be fall apart tender and the beef may shred. No worries it still tastes fantastic! I would suggest using a sharp knife or an electric knife.
15. Serve with mashed potatoes YUM! Ladle the sauce over the meat and potatoes. Enjoy!,

5. Pour into pie shell. Bake 15 minutes; reduce heat to 350 and bake another 35-40 minutes until golden brown.
6. Mrs. G. used to add about 1/4 teaspoon baking powder to the pie shell dough. (She did not use yeast which some German onion pie recipes use.).
7. These are the changes that I made from the original recipe that I found in a book:  the written recipe calls for 2 whole eggs plus 2 egg yolks; Mrs. G. used 3 whole eggs.
8. The written recipe calls for 1 cup butter; I am guessing that it may not need that much.,

3. Note:  People in the United States should NOT be looking for "Sahnesteif" they should be looking for "Whip it".  If you're in a German speaking country - you should be looking for "Sahnesteif" not "Whip it". No matter if you are in America or Europe - it's in the baking aisle and "Whip it"/"Sahnesteif" is ALWAYS in a blue envelope right next to the yellow envelopes of Vanilla Sugar.

instructions, 1. Sift the confectioners' sugar.
2. Put 1/2 cup of the sifted confectioners' sugar 10 ounces (3 heaping cups) of the almonds and all the cinnamon in a food processor. Process until the nuts are finely ground with just a few larger pieces.
3. Whip the egg whites in a large clean bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until they hold soft peaks about 1 minute. Gradually add the remaining 1 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar while whipping until the whites are thick creamy and somewhat stiff about 2 minutes more. Set aside 2/3 cup of this meringue for topping the cookies.
4. Fold the ground almond mixture and the lemon zest into the remaining meringue to make a stiff dough.
5. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
6. Lay a sheet of parchment or waxed paper on the work surface and lightly dust with confectioners' sugar. Turn the dough out onto the dusted paper flatten and dust with more sugar as needed and then lay another sheet of parchment or waxed paper on top. Roll the dough between the papers until it is about 1/4-inch thick. Flip the dough over and gently peel off a sheet of the paper. For ease when cutting lay the paper back on the dough flip again and gently pull off the other side of the paper so that the dough is fully released from it.
7. Cut cookies with a 3-inch star cutter and place about 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. (Excess dough can be rerolled.) Use a small spoon brush or offset spatula to spread the reserved meringue over the top of each cookie taking care not to let the meringue drip over the sides. Press or sprinkle remaining sliced almonds in a decorative pattern into the meringue.
8. Bake cookies until bottoms are light golden brown and meringue is set and crisp about 30 minutes. Turn off the oven and open the oven door to release heat and dry cookies out in the oven for 10 more minutes.
9. Busy baker's tips: The dough can be frozen between the sheets of paper for up to 2 weeks. Store baked cookies in an airtight container for up to 10 days.,

instructions, 1. In a saucepan combine sauerkraut including canning liquid bell pepper onion celery vinegar sugar and water.
2. Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered for 1 to 3 hours (3 hours is best) while occasionally stirring to prevent sticking. Add more water as needed to keep from drying out but not too much because relish should not be watery. Note: do not inhale steam from relish while cooking it because boiling vinegar can take one's breath away and is really painful (I learned this the hard way) lol.
3. Can be eaten right way. Tastes even better the next day. Store in refrigerator.,

instructions, 1. Grind the almonds in a food processor for about two minutes: it will first become crumbly and the crumbs will get successively smaller until it is more of a fine powder. Keep it going through this stage and when it nearly forms clumps that’s when you’ve got it right.
2. Add the confectioners’ sugar and almond extract then the corn syrup processing until well-combined.
3. Turn the mixture out onto a work surface and knead until it makes a smooth dough. If the dough seems too sticky knead in a little more confectioners’ sugar. If it seems too dry add more corn syrup. At this point the dough can be tightly wrapped in foil and refrigerated until needed.
4. If you would like to dip in chocolate mold marzipan into desired shapes (I used a small marble-sized heart cookie cutter). Heat chocolate in microwave or in a double boiler stirring regularly until melted and smooth. dip marzipan shapes one by one into melted chocolate and place on parchment paper until set. You can also put in the fridge to speed up the process.,

cuisine, European >> Deutschland >> German, 
time, ,

instructions, 1. Wash Canaroli rice under running water until water is almost clear.
2. Put rice into pot. Add two cups of milk the lemon rind and salt. Bring to a boil. Stirring frequently to avoid sticking of rice and burning.
3. Reduce heat to medium high and boil for 15 to 20 minutes. It should be a soft boiling. Stir frequently to avoid burning.
4. If the milk is absorbed before the rice is done add a little more milk. The rice is done when it is soft but still has a bite. This should be after 15 minutes. If you like the rice more soft cook it longer. You should taste some rice corns from time to time (see not on cooking time).
5. After the rice is cooked to the consistency you like remove from heat and remove lemon rind.  Add butter sugar and vanilla extract. Stir.
6. If the consistency of the milk rice is too firm add some more milk or cream for desired consistency.
7. For serving: mix sugar with cinnamon.
8. Serve milk risotto warm. Serve sugar-cinnamon mixture so that everyone can adjust sweetness. If you like not overly sweet just sprinkle some cinnamon over the milk risotto.
9. NOTE on "Cooking Time": Carnaroli Rice needs about 15 minutes to be "al dente". If you like it more soft cook it longer for about 5 minutes. Taste from time to time some rice corns. I always start with 2 cups of milk but depending on cooking time and desired "softness" of rice you may need more (up to 3 cups). If the milk is absorbed add just a little more milk. If you like the "pure" Risotto consistency the consistnecy should be creamy and the spoon should build a wave when you stir the rice.
10. NOTE on "Carnaroli Rice": I use this rice because it gives the best results. You could use other rice varieties like Arborio but it should be a high quality short grain rice which is suitable for making a Risotto.,

2. If using frozen lingonberries let them thaw slowly in refrigerator. Bring the quark and the butter to room temperature.
3. Prepare the dough for the bottom crust. Stir the quark until smooth add the soft butter. Mix thoroughly. Finally add the flour mixing it in gently by hand. Stir just until combined do not overmix.
4. Cut a disk of parchment paper and place on the bottom of a small springform cake pan (Ø 20 cm). Using your hands lightly press the soft dough onto the bottom and the sides (about 3 cm up) of the pan.
5. Although the amount of dough may seem inadequate just keep spreading it patiently. The crust will be fairly thin. Place the pan in refrigerator.
6. For the filling mix the quark until smooth. Mix in the sugar and the vanilla sugar then the flour the cream and the egg. Mix until smooth.
7. Gently mix the lingonberries with the brown sugar. Spread the mixture on the bottom crust. Pour the quark mixture evenly on top. Bake for about 30-40 minutes
8. Bake the cake in the lower part of the oven preferably using the bottom heat. Otherwise the bottom crust may easily remain half-baked and soggy. Using a glass pie dish will also help to determine when the bottom crust is cooked enough. The centre of the filling will remain slightly wobbly.
9. In room temperature let the cake cool thoroughly in the pan.
10. When the centre of the cake is firm enough remove the cake from the pan cut in slices and serve. The cake may also be served chilled.,

instructions, 1. In a large pan stir together the first list of ingredients.
2. Heat and boil lightly for 5 minutes.
3. Stirring occasionaly.
4. This smells so good as it's cooking that I usually stand at the stove the whole time just stirring and smelling.
5. MMM Allow to cool.
6. My family traditionally cooks this in the evening.
7. We leave the pan on the stove and just put a lid on it before bed.
8. Some time the next day it's baked.
9. When cool add the flour and soda dissolved in water into the mixture in the pan.
10. Ok here's the tricky part.
11. The pans need to be prepared.
12. Preheat oven to 350°F while preparing pans.
13. Cut the grocery bags open and cut each bag in halve crosswise.
14. You'll need two loaf pans.
15. Place a pan on the counter upside down.
16. Now take a piece of paper and wrap the pan.
17. Use masking tape to secure.
18. Keep any printing on the outside.
19. Now turn the pan over and place the shaped piece of paper inside the pan as a lining.
20. Trim the paper so it meets or is just a little taller than the pan edges.
21. Repeat this process three more times so that each loaf pan has a double liner.
22. I hope this makes sense.
23. Some in my family have experimented succuesfully with lining the pans with wax paper instead of brown paper.
24. Divide the batter into the two pans.
25. Bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
26. Cover with another piece of paper if the top starts getting too done.
27. Baking time will need experimentation.
28. Oven temperature weather ingredient variables etc can lead to bread that's a little too dry or too gooey.
29. But it will still taste great even if the cooking time needs to be adjusted just a little.
30. When done remove from pan to cool.
31. WARNING: The bread will be stuck to the inside liner.
32. Discard the outside liner and cool the bread still stuck to the inside liner.
33. Unfortunatly You'll be smelling the wonderful smells fill your kitchen but it can't be eaten yet.
34. The bread needs to be frozen for at least a day or two to meld the flavors and get the consistency just right.
35. Stick the bread into a bag and into the freezer.
36. When thawed we peel the paper off just a little at a time as we eat it.
37. (Unless we are wanting to slice the whole loaf at once.) Store on the counter inside the plastic bag.,

3. Defrost salmon and pat dry with paper towels.
4. Remove any bones you detect with clean pliers.

6. Take the salt sugar and pepper and mix thoroughly in a bowl.
7. Evenly apply the salt/sugar/pepper mix onto the salmon flesh being careful to cover every part with a little less for the thin ends and more on the thicker parts.
8. Sprinkle the dill over the salted fish.
9. Flip one side over onto the other making a sandwich.
10. Place one end of a long strip of muslin underneath the fish.
11. Roll the fish over toward you and tug a little on the muslin to tighten. Repeat until out of muslin.

13. Place the fish on the baking sheet to catch drips and place in the fridge.
14. Turn once or twice per day for three days.

instructions, 1. Take a leg of lamb with bone Wash under running cold water and pat dry. Season with salt and pepper. you can also use Aromat (flavour enhancer) Season-All garlic and coriander.
2. Quarter an onion and put in a roasting pan with the meat. It's good to rub the meat with the onion before seasoning.
3. Cover and insert into a heated oven (175-200° C.).
4. Allow the meat to brown on the outside about 15-20 minutes.
5. Pour in some water to cover the bottom of the pan and add more water as it evaporates.
6. Baste the meat with the water and juices. The roast should stay in the oven for about 2 hours. After about 1 1/2 hours take the roast out and pour off the cooking liquid. Return to the oven without covering to brown. Use the cooking liquid to make the sauce (see recipe below).
7. Alternate method: If you have enough time slow-roast the meat. Treat as above cover and insert into a 200°C oven. Lower heat immediately to about 125°C Allow to brown and add water.
8. Slow roast at 125°C for 1 hour then turn up the heat to 150°C and roast for another hour.
9. Turn up the heat to 175°C and roast for a third hour. Pour off the liquid and put uncovered into a 200°C oven to brown. Icelandic lamb is very tender and this slow cooking method makes it so soft that it almost melts off the bone while still retaining the flavour.
10. Sauce to serve with Sunday roast: Pour the cooking liquid off the meat through a strainer. Put the onions in the strainer and mash into the liquid. Skim off the fat. Heat to boiling. Mix together some water and flour into a smooth thin paste. When the liquid boils add the flour paste stirring constantly until sauce begins to thicken. Stir well to mix. Strain if the sauce is lumpy (sift the flour to avoid this). Heat to boiling again and add some cream (not strictly necessary but improves the flavour and smoothness). Adjust the flavour with salt/spices if necessary.
11. For an authentic Icelandic Sunday roast serve with the sauce on the side boiled or caramelized potatoes green peas and rhubarb jam. For my part I like to leave out the peas and jam and serve instead a fresh salad and some sautéed mushrooms. If you feel like eating anything else after this heavy repast ice-cream is the favoured dessert. Home-made ice-cream is especially good.,

instructions, 1. Preheat your gas or charcoal grill to a hot to medium hot level. You want your fire to be just under the hot level but not to the medium hot level yet.
2. Meanwhile allow your scallops to come to room temp while your prepare the vinaigrette.
3. Combine the vinegar honey mustard and oil in a bowl and whisk together with a fork. If it does not whisk together well just pop it into the microwave for about 30 seconds. Warming makes the honey mix more easily with the other ingredients.
4. Pour half the vinaigrette into a small serving bowl. Set aside. Toss the scallops with the remaining vinaigrette remove them from the bowl and season with salt pepper and thyme.
5. The grilling has to be done very quickly. Grill the scallops for a minute or two on one side then throw the black peppercorns onto the hottest part of the fire. (This really only works on a charcoal fire. You could try putting the peppercorns in foil with the top open and place the packet on the hottest part of the grill. Put the packet on as soon as you start your gas grill) Allow the scallops to cook for about 2 or 3 minutes more.
6. Turn the scallops and allow them to cook for about 4 to 5 minutes on this side then remove them and serve immediately using the remaining vinaigrette as a salad dressing for the greens.
7. NOTE: You could do the same with shrimp or half shrimp and half scallops. Please adjust your time with the size of your seafood.
8. One MORE NOTE: Please allow your ingredients to warm up to room temp before placing on the grill for more accurate cooking times. Thanks!,

2. Make the gingerbread syrup by combining water sugar ginger cinnamon and vanilla in a medium saucepan. Be sure the pan is not too small or the mixture could easily bubble over.
3. Bring mixture to a boil then reduce heat and simmer the syrup uncovered for about 15 minutes. Remove the syrup from the heat when it's done - thickened glossy and clear - and then cover it. This can now be stored in a bottle or jar in the fridge for about a month.
4. Gingerbread Coffee.
5. Make the fresh coffee in your coffee filter machine to personal taste - I have suggested 1/2 scoop of medium blend coffee per person for a tall mug of coffee.
6. Just before serving the gingerbread coffees whip the cream with a hand held mixer until it just holds its shape - then add the cognac cinnamon and icing sugar and whip until it is firm. If you have a cream siphon - decant the cream into the siphon for piping later.
7. When you are ready to serve the gingerbread coffees pour some fresh coffee into each tall mug until about two thirds full; add a tablespoon of ginger syrup and stir the coffee - taste it and adjust the flavour by adding more syrup if needed. Then carefully spoon or pipe the cream on to the top of the coffee. Sprinkle with ground cinnamon and serve with a cinnamon stick as a stirrer!
8. If you have any cream left over - make another gingerbread coffee!,

2. Meanwhile roll and tie the loin so that you'll be able to stuff things into the inside.
3. Drain the rehydrated plums reserving the liquid.

8. When it's done carefully remove the meat from the roasting pan and let the meat sit covered for a few minutes on a platter (probably the one you'll serve it on).
9. Move the roasting pan back to the stovetop and set on medium low then pour in a cup of half and half into the remaining liquid in the pan.
10. Stir in one to two tablespoons of current jelly (to taste) and let it reduce to your preferred thickness for the sauce.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

instructions, 1. Pan fry chicken in half of the butter just until no longer pink in the middle turning once to ensure both sides are browned.
2. Remove chicken from pan and keep in a warm place or cover with foil.
3. Core and slice apples as desired. I like to use my apple slicer- looks like a wagon wheel with handles- and then slice each lengthwise to make them thinner. To peel or not to peel- hehehehe- up to you. Likewise red or green- the choice is yours. I like peel on and red for color!
4. Add the rest of the butter apples and thyme and fry until apples are as crisp or tender as you like.
5. Pour apples over chicken and keep warm.
6. Deglaze the pan with wine cider or juice scraping all the yummy bits off the bottom.
7. Add the cream- could use reduced fat sour cream or reduced fat or nonfat yogurt to reduce fat/calories. Yogurt will and a nice ‘tang’ to the sauce.
8. Cook until slightly thickened.
9. Return the chicken and apple mixture to the pan to make sure apples and chicken are nice and warm.
10. When you are satisfied with the temperature of the dish serve and enjoy!

11. Mix the following wet ingredients together in a mixer: 1 cup butter 1.5 cups sugar 2 eggs 1 tspn almond extract 2 tbsp light cream.
12. Mix dry ingredients in another mixing bowl: 4 cups flour 1 pinch of salt 1 tspn baking powder 1/2 cup ground almonds (optional) 1 tspn cardamom (optional).
13. Add dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix well in the mixer.
14. Remove the doughy mixture from the mixer and knead it around 10 times on countertop until it binds together.  You will barely need to knead this as it is not leavened.
15. Chill dough for 20 minutes in refrigerator.
16. Spread the dough into six 9" ungreased circular pans with palms until spread evenly across the bottom.  If you don not have 6 pans you can repeat this process 6 times with 1 pan it will just take longer (or 3 times with 2 pans et cetera).
17. Bake at 350F for 20 minutes.  (Jump ahead and do the icing if you are impatient.).
18. Pop the layers out of the pans and cool on cooling racks.
19. When all 6 layers are complete assemble layers and prune filling by starting with a layer for the bottom.  Spread on 1/5th of your filling onto the base layer then add another layer cake add another 1/5th - etc.  repeat until your vineterta is complete.
20. Prepare your icing by mixing the following with a beater in a mixing bowl: 3 tbsp softened butter 3/4 cup powdered icing sugar 2 tspn light cream 1/4 cup ground almonds (optional) 1/8 tspn almond extract.
21. Spread the icing on top of the vineterta.
22. Decorate with icing with the sliced almonds.
23. Chill everything and let it set.
24. This torte may be kept in the fridge for extended length of time and is better for having been “aged” in the fridge for at least a couple of weeks to a month.
25. When serving slice into small rectangular pieces (about 2" by 1" or smaller) and serve cold.,

instructions, 1. Brown butter in a Dutch oven or other thick bottomed roasting pan. Add the curry powder and brown it until fragrant.
2. Add paprika powder and then the chopped onion.
3. When the onion are almost tender/clear add the flour and bake it while stirring thoroughly. It is importaint to bake the flour thoroughly or the gravy can end up tasting like flour.
4. Add warm milk and bake it all until it thickens.
5. Add tomato paste garlic heavy cream and salt and pepper and mix well. Keep the sauce warm but do NOT allow it to boil.
6. Cut the tenderloins into stroganoff-like strips. Be sure the strips are cut crosswise! Tip: Split the tenderloin lenghwise one or two times then cut crosswise into strips.
7. In a frying pan brown some additional butter and quickly brown the meat. Do NOT attempt to fry too much at a time! Overcrowding the pan and you risk boiling the meat instead of browning it. The meat need just be browned - no need to fully cook it.
8. Add the browned meat to the warm sauce and let it sit for about 20 minutes to give flavor and finish cooking. Still do NOT let it boil under any circumstances but on the other hand it should be kept warm.
9. Finally stir in whiskey.,

time, ,

instructions, 1. Boil 5 lbs (this equals about 15 c of potatoes mashed) of peeled potatoes cut in chunks.
2. When they are tender drain well and put through a potato ricer.
3. While they are still hot add the margerine (in small chunks) and sugar.
4. Stir well and then add the cream inches Potatoes should be a soft smooth consistency but still hold shape. Divide into 3 bowls and let cool overnight in the fridge.
5. In the morning add 1/14 c flour to each bowl and mix well into a paste.
6. Divide into balls that are about 1/2 c to 3/4 in size and place on cookie sheets. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to cook them.
7. Heat lefse griddle (or other heavy griddle) to about 400 degrees (may have to do a few testers to get the temp right-be sure to eat the evidence!).
8. Only take 1 dough ball out of the fridge at a time. Flour the cloth covered surface well and roll the dough ball in circles to cover all sides in a light coating of flour.
9. Then roll in several directions with a heavy rolling pin covered in cloth until paper thin. Use the lefse stick to lift the dough circle through the center place on the griddle and UNROLL the dough onto the griddle.  1st side will bubble up within a few minutes when the heat is right and the center will appear "dry".
10. Flip to the other side with the lefse stick using the same "unrolling" technique. Cook another minute or two or until the bubbles have even browning on them. You can flip them multiple times to get the correct browing on each side. Cooking them too long will create dry lefse so cook the minimum amount of time for them to be cooked through and the bubbles browned.
11. As each lefse piece is finished stack them into a pile and brush off any excess flour. Also brush the browned flour off of the griddle. Add more flour to rolling board as needed - just enough to keep things from sticking.
12. After they have cooled completely (a few hours) they should be stored in air tight containers. A suggested idea is to fold 3 lefse pieces into wedge shapes then store in  quart sized ziploc bags then put in the freezer. As needed take them out and thaw at room temp for a while.
13. Traditionally lefse is served spread with butter and/or sugar and then rolled up. Some people use jam on them as well. A little cinnamon sugar on them is also delicious. I prefer them warm but can be served cold as well.,

Cook for 2 to 3 minutes then fold over one of the edges of the egg using a spoon or fork. Fold it down about an inch. Fold the opposite end over as well. Then fold the remaining two edges over creating a small rectangular or square mini-omelet.
7. Repeat with peppers onions and one egg EACH until you have four square mini omelets.

11. When the bagels are toasted spread about 1/2 tablespoon of the sauce onto the face of the top bagel half. Place a slice of American cheese onto the face of the top bagel half. Place a slice of Monterey Jack cheese over the face of the bottom bagel half. Place a sausage patty on the cheese on the bottom bagel half. Place the finished omelet onto the sausage on the bottom half of the sandwich.

instructions, 1. Brown the diced beef in olive oil in the saucepan and leave aside for later.
2. Chop the onion the garlic clove and the pepper very thinly. In the remaining oil sauté the finely chopped vegetables. Note: if you're not going to use a blender with the sauce and prefer it with chunks a thinly chopped pepper will release its flavour more efficiently.
3. Once the onion is golden and translucent add the white wine the salt and the black pepper. Add some water (for now fairly roughly just to keep it liquid). Now it's the moment (OPTIONAL) to emulsify it with a blender.
4. Add the thyme the rosemary the bay leaf and the cloves.
5. Add the meat and the potato (chopped chunky) cover with more warm water. Place a lid on top and leave on medium heat to finish cooking. Don't allow the mixture to boil very vigorously just enough to cook the meat. In a pressure cooker it will take around 15 minutes but it varies a lot depending on the model. With a saucepan it will usually take around 45-50 minutes.
6. Remember to keep watching the water level if in a saucepan to avoid too much water loss. Add water when needed try the sauce if in doubt to tell whether it needs further adjusting with salt/pepper.,

instructions, 1. It's best to have all of your ingredients prepared before you start cooking.
2. Prepare the rabbit by separating the legs cutting remaining meat into small slices and lightly salting. (In my area rabbit is seasonal. During the summer and fall I substitute with chicken legs).
3. I peel my shrimp leaving only the tail and then salt them. In Spain they tend to leave the shrimp unshelled.
4. I always try to make my chicken stock from scratch (time permitting) adding a bit of rosemary a tiny pinch of saffron and a bit of thyme. If you're going to use bouillon I'd recommend at least heating it up with these herbs and then straining before you start.
5. Keep your stock hot but not boiling as you cook.
6. Coat the bottom of your pallera/pan with olive oil.
7. Brown your chorizo over high heat for 1-2 minutes. Do not fully cook just get the outside well browned. Set aside. This should add a nice red color and a hell of a flavor to your oil.
8. Brown the Rabbit for 2-3 minutes. It should not be fully cooked. Set aside.
9. Brown garlic onion and bell pepper until they're softened adding plum tomatoes shortly before the mixture is finished.
10. Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and on the other add the half can of tomato paste. Caramelize it flipping it and spreading it until it begins to loosen (1-2 min over hight heat).
11. Mix all of the vegetables and meats together with the caramelized tomato paste also adding the paprika parsley and thyme.
12. Add rice mixing together and stirring as the rice browns (1-1 1/2) minutes. As the rice browns mix in the saffron. Make sure to break it between your fingers and stir it in to release all those tasty oils.
13. When the rice is slightly translucent add enough chicken stock to cover the whole mixture. If it's been kept warm it will begin to boil almost immediately. Lower to a medium heat but keep it at a steady boil.
14. This is where paella is made and broken. I stir a few times in the first 5-10 minutes adding broth as necessary to keep the rice fully covered. After this you must let the paella SIT! Let it cook another 10-20 minutes (I find that this step takes longer on a stovetop) adding broth bit by bit to keep the rice submerged until the rice on the top is al dente. Don't worry about rice burning to the bottom this part (which actually has a name which escapes me at the moment it's something like socarrat) is a tasty delicacy.
15. Once you've stirred the paella for the last time and are letting cook when you have about 8 minutes left to cook lay shrimp on top turning over after 2-4 minutes to cook other side.
16. When the rice on top is still quite al dente take paella off of heat and cover. You must let it sit for 15-20 minutes. I've taken the lid off prematurely and ended up with a crunchy mess. Patience is the key.
17. Once you're sure it's ready uncover garnish with lemon wedges and enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Stir packet of gelatin into 1/4 cup water and set aside.
2. Arrange 12 small heat proof containers for the caramel sauce. If you intend to flip them out of the containers onto a plate later you can lightly grease them. I eat them out of the cups.
3. Put 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water into a medium pot on high heat till mixture begins to boil then turn to medium. Swirl the pot occasionally to distribute the heat; be careful of little specks of sugar water that splatter.
4. Have your 3/4 cup boiling water ready. When the mixture turns amber (lighter or darker according to your taste) remove pot from the heat and tilt away from you. With oven mitted hand pour the boiling water into the pot. The mixture will bubble and steam vehemently swirl the pot to mix the boiling water and sugar so that the sugar does not seize.
5. Pour a little over 1 tablespoon of caramel in each cup.
6. Set a pot of water to boil. You essentially will be setting up a double boiler by placing your glass/metal bowl of custard (in the step below) atop it. Make sure that the boiling water will not touch the bottom of your glass/metal bowl when it rests on top.
7. Optional: set up a second container with an ice bath to place your glass bowl into once you're done cooking the custard. This will chill the mixture quicker so that you can sooner put your flans in the fridge but it's not necessary.
8. In a glass/metal bowl beat 5 eggs 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tsp vanilla together until smooth. Meanwhile heat 1 cup of milk in the microwave until almost boiling.
9. Stirring the egg mixture constantly pour the scalded milk in a slow stream into the eggs to temper them.
10. Set aside 3/4 cup of milk.
11. Once the water is boiling turn the heat down to a simmer (for me this is medium low) and nestle your custard bowl on top making sure it doesn't tilt and spew your liquids onto the burner.
12. Add your gelatin mixture and stir gently (to minimize any bubbles) and constantly for fifteen minutes or until your custard reaches a temperature of 170 degrees F (77 degrees C). You'll see the custard thicken slightly up the sides of the bowl. Check the texture to ensure it's smooth if you see it start to curdle this means the double boiler is too hot. Take the bowl off and turn the heat down to give your pot of water and custard a brief moment to cool down.
13. Once the time is up or the temperature is reached transfer your bowl of custard to the ice bath or alternately a pot holder.
14. As with tempering the eggs stir your milk into the mixture and then continue stirring till your custard has cooled. At this point it will still be fairly liquid.
15. Pour the custard through a sieve and into another bowl to capture any large curds that may have developed. Then portion a little under 1/3 cup of custard into each container and let them cool to room temperature.
16. If you care about appearances before putting the flans in the fridge tap/drop them lightly on the counter to remove any air bubbles that may be trapped and/or have formed on the surface. Otherwise just cover and hide them away in the icebox for at least an hour.
17. After that you can guzzle them straight out of the cup. Or there are two other options. You can dip the cup in hot water or slide a slim object around the edge of the container and plop it on onto a dish.,

name, Shrimp Wrapped Chorizo Skewers With Onions & Olives, 
cuisine, European >> Spanish and Portuguese >> Spanish, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Skewers  --  The first thing is to soak the wooden skewers (if using wood ones) I soak them for 15-20 minutes.
2. Chorizo and Shrimp  --  Slice up the chorizo into 1/4-1/2" slices or rounds; you should be able to get 5-6 slices per link depending on the brand of chorizo. Make as many rounds or slices as you have shrimp. Jumbo shrimp are usually 12-16 shrimp per pound. Wrap each shrimp around the outside edge of the chorizo they should wrap around the chorizo pretty well then thread the skewer through the shrimp then through the chorizo (horizontally) and back out through the shrimp on the other side. The shrimp and chorizo will lay flat.
3. After you skewer a shrimp/chorizo combination then alternate with the onions and olives and back to another shrimp/chorizo.  There is no right or wrong; add as many of each as you want. But remember to leave a little room in between each ingredient so they can grill evenly - don't over crowd.  For an appetizer just add one of each on small skewers they are great at parties.  And as I mentioned adding mozzarella balls also are a great addition to these skewers if you want.
4. Grilling  --  An outdoor grill works best but an indoor grill pan will work fine. Medium high to high heat and brush with the Italian dressing before you grill and a couple of times during cooking. Five (5) to 7 min per side until the shrimp turn pink and begin to curl and the chorizo gets a light char. They don't take long at all. The onions will get lightly brown and the olives get warm and salty.
5. Serve  --  I like to serve these on a big family platter over cheesy polenta but these are also wonderful appetizers. Add some grilled bread with my anchovy butter and you have a very easy dinner but elegant enough to serve to company. ENJOY!,

instructions, 1. Boil 2 cups of water with salt and cook the clams and the mussels until they are open. If any of them are still closed remove them. Boil in the same water the remaining sea food for a couple of minutes. Drain the liquid and set aside for the fish stock.
2. Peel the prawns king prawns and/or Norway lobster leaving some of them unpeeled for decoration.
3. Prepare 1 litre fish stock using the water we set aside before fish/ chicken powdered stock (or stock cubes) and the prawn skins. Add the yellow food colouring. Drain and set aside.
4. Put the frying pan/ paella onto heat with 2-4 tablespoons olive oil. Fry on a heavy fire the sliced chicken until slightly brown but not completely cooked. Set aside.
5. Do the same with the squid stripes.
6. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and the onion finely chopped. When the chopped onion is transparent add the red pepper finely chopped and cook until tender.
7. Now add the tomatoes finely chopped and cook for 10 minutes approximately until you have a thick tomato sauce or just add the 100 cl. tomato sauce.
8. Peel the garlic and smash it with some parsley until you get a paste.
9. Add 1 lt. fish stock the garlic and parsley paste and the remaining vegetables to the frying pan with the thick sauce and let it simmer. The resulting "soup"  must have a salty  taste as the rice will absorb much of the salt and flavour. Cook for 10 minutes or until vegetables are "al dente".
10. Now add the rice to the soup (you can choose to rinse it in order to remove some starch before). Mix all ingredients with a wooden spoon. Put fire higher for 7-10 minutes.
11. Add the fish sea food and chicken and set a low fire for another 5-10 minutes. This part of the cooking is quite important as you may need to add some boiling water when necessary. It is advisable not to stir the ingredients to avoid breaking the rice grains and  paella becoming sticky. You are only allowed to shake gently the pan in this part of the process.
12. After this time if rice is not yet cooked and it has little water cover the paella with aluminium paper and let it cook for 2 minutes more or so. Anyway it is always preferable a paella with some liquid than overcooked.
13. Uncover the paella decorate with the unpeeled king prawns and/or Norway lobsters and let the rice rest for at least 5 minutes so it absorbs the remaining water.

instructions, 1. In a large bowl combine the meat eggs garlic parsley salt and pepper.  In a small bowl soften the bread crumbs with the wine for 10 minutes  Add the crumbs and wine to the meat mixture and mix well - you will need to do this with your hands in order to get everything incorporated well.
2. Make your balls.  For appetizers I make 1-inch wide balls for a main dish you can make them about 3-inches wide.
3. In a large non-stick casserole (a large Le Creuset dutch oven is my preferred vessel for this - whatever you use it needs to be large enough to hold all the balls and heavy enough to cook evenly and it needs a lid) heat the oil over medium-high heat and brown the balls.  If you are making the appetizer-sized balls you will probably have to do this in batches adding oil as needed.  Move the browned ones to paper towels to drain while you’re cooking the rest.
4. When the balls are all browned add additional oil if needed and cook the onion gently over medium heat until it’s wilted (make sure you do not burn the onion - reduce heat and wait for a few minutes if your stove tends to over heat).
5. After the onion has wilted put the balls back in the pan and stir gently to get them warmed back up.  Pour the brandy into the pan and stand back.  Light a match and touch it just over the top of the meatballs - the brandy should ignite and flame up.  Without panicking stir the meatballs gently until the flames completely subside.  Add the tomato sauce and broth.  Salt to taste stir to combine and cover.
6. Cook over low heat for 45 minutes.  You may want to check from time to time to make sure there is enough liquid.  I have sometimes added more wine or broth about halfway through.  You want enough sauce to coat the meatballs but not so much that it's soupy.
7. These can sit in a chafing dish and are even better the next day.  If serving as a main meal steamed rice or boiled new potatoes are a great addition.,

instructions, 1. In a 450-degree Fahrenheit (230-degrees Celsius) oven roast the peeled cloves of garlic in canola oil. Wrap the garlic cloves and oil tightly in tin foil. To make the garlic cloves soft like butter this will take between 30 and 40 minutes. To prevent scorching add a half teaspoon of water to the tinfoil:  this will keep it from browning however and the taste won't be quite the same. But it should protect the delicate garlic from burning.
2. In a blender place the roasted garlic with the egg lemon juice salt and white pepper. Starting at medium speed blend for about a minute until the garlic has been fully incorporated into the blend.
3. Start with a few drops rising to a drizzle and add the olive oil. Keep blending for about 5 minutes until the aioli comes together into a thick white sauce.

instructions, 1. Start by peeling the potatoes and slicing them roughly. Then peel and thinly slice both the onion and the garlic. Pour the oil into a saucepan and let it warm on the hob until it starts to smoke. Then add the potatoes the onion and the garlic and let these cook for about 5 minutes turning occasionaly.
2. Next add the bay leaves the cayenne pepper and finally a tsp of sweet paprika. Be careful at this point you need to get the paprika coated in the oil without burning it - to do this successfully stir non-stop for between 20 to 30 seconds then immediately add the water until the potato mixture is covered. Remove the cayenne pepper and let the stew boil for 20 minutes.
3. Meanwhile prepare the tomatoes and the fish. To easily peel the tomatoes scald them (cover for half a minute with boiling water) and then remove the skin. Chop the tomatoes roughly and purée them using a fork. Next cut the fish into small cubes carefully removing any remaining bones.
4. When the 20 minutes are up (this time really depends on the type of potatoes) add the tomato purée and leave the dish simmering on the hob for a further 7 minutes. Then add the tuna and cook it for just 5 to 7 minutes more - you really have to be careful not to overcook the fish or it won’t be tender. Sprinkle with the chopped parsley and serve in bowls.,

cuisine, European >> Spanish and Portuguese >> Spanish, 
time, ,

instructions, 1. Sage Walnut Pesto:  Start by making the pesto.  Place the sage leaves walnuts and crushed garlic in a food processor or high speed blender.  Process on low to allow everything to be broken down into little shreds.  Add the olive oil lemon 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a few grinds of pepper and process again until well combined but still rustic looking.  Taste for salt and olive oil and add more if necessary.
2. Sweet Potato Spanish  Tortilla:  Turn on the broiler.  Heat a tablespoon of ghee in a large heavy skillet over medium heat.  Add sweet potatoes in an even layer.  Once you've finished layering them approximately 2 minutes later begin stirring the potatoes so that they flip and cook evenly.  Add the onions and continue to cook until both the potatoes and onions are just soft.  Sprinkle generously with kosher salt and pepper.  Remove the sweet potato and onion mixture to a plate.
3. Whisk the eggs milk and salt and pepper together in a medium bowl.
4. Meanwhile melt the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of ghee in the pan being sure to coat the sides.  Add that potato-onion mixture back in in as even a layer as you can.
5. Pour the egg mixture over top gently lifting the potatoes from around the sides of the pan to allow the egg to get into all the crevices.  As the tortilla begins to turn you want to continuously run a small spatula along the side of the tortilla tilting the pan so that the egg can run under.  Alternate this with flattening the mixture down gently with your spatula.
6. Once the tortilla is just about set take the pan and place it under the broiler.  Cook for approximately 2 minutes or until set set but not browned.  Take it out and top with the optional goat cheese if using.  Place under the broiler again for another minute or two until browned but not burned.  If you're not using the goat cheese just keep the pan under the broiler for another minute or two until browned but not burned.
7. Remove from the oven and allow it to cool slightly.
8. You should be able to lift the whole thing right out of the pan.
9. Top with a sprinkling of parsley and a dollop of sage walnut pesto.,

instructions, 1. Make sure you prepare this in the morning and leave it bubbling away for at least 8 hours (make sure you don't leave it unattended and follow the guidelines of your slow-cooker).

2. 1.  Prepare all veggies and chop into about inch size pieces or bigger if you like (I prefer big chunks).
3. 2.  Prepare the tomatoes as above.
4. 3.  Chop the stewing beef into inch size pieces you don't really want them much bigger as they will go chewy and not soft.
5. 4.  Chop the chorizo sausages as above into cm size slices.
6. 5.  place all ingredients (except the gravy granules and worcester sauce) into your slow cooker along with the water or vegetable stock and turn on as per guidelines.  Leave until it comes to the boil and when it starts to simmer add the gravy granules and worcester sauce.  Leave bubbling away for approx 8 hours (3 hours if not using a slow cooker) and then serve.   be careful as can be very hot!,

If you must make ahead or need to save leftovers add the pits of the Avocados to the dip and put lime juice on the top layer and then cover with plastic wrap pushing down onto the dip.

Then place in a pan of boiling water for 10 seconds remove and plunge into a bowl of iced or very cold water (this latter step is to stop the tomatoes from cooking and going mushy).
2. Slice the tops off the tomatoes and just enough of their bases to remove the rounded ends so that they will sit squarely on the plate. Keep the tops if using small tomatoes but discard those large tomatoes. Remove the seeds and insides either with a teaspoon or small sharp knife.
3. Mash the eggs with the allioli -or the mayonnaise if using- salt pepper and parsley. Stuff the tomatoes firmly pressing the filling down. With small tomatoes replace the lids at a jaunty angle. If keeping to serve later brush them with olive oil and black pepper to prevent them from drying out. Cover with plastic wrap and keep.
4. For large tomatoes the filling must be firm enough to be sliced. If you make your own mayonnaise thicken it by using more egg yolks. If you use shop-bought mayonnaise or allioli add white breadcrumbs until the mixture reaches the consistency of mashed potatoes.
5. Season. Fill the tomatoes pressing down firmly until level. Refrigerate for 1 hour then slice with a sharp carving knife into rings. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.,

2. Trim any excess fat off the topside already in 1/2-inch thick slices. You might want to brown before adding it but I've found that it ends up equally well without doing so however you prefer.
3. Stir the flour into the saucepan as a thickener and soon after that add the cup of white wine or sherry. Add the salt and pepper.
4. Put the topside in the saucepan with the rest of the ingredients. Heat up some water and pour it in to cover the topside fully. Add the thyme rosemary and cloves.
5. Cover the pot cook at medium heat so that it is boiling constantly but nothing too vigorous. This should be ready in about an hour if you are preparing it in a normal saucepan. In a pressure cooker it shouldn't take as long. Keep adding water if the water level falls too much and when it's almost done (you can tell because the meat should be very tender soft and fairly easy to cut into even with a spoon) take the lid off to allow to reduce.
6. About 10 minutes before the meat is ready (don't worry it won't overcook) start preparing the rice. Heat up some olive oil in a pan. Gently squash the garlic clove and add it to the pan.
7. Once it's golden add the rice and stir around. Immediately add the same volume of water. Heat up some more water (again one cup of water per cup of rice added) and add it to the rice. Add salt pepper and a bay leaf. Lower the heat to medium so that it boils but doesn't get too vigorous.
8. After 10-12 minutes the rice should be ready. It should go fairly dry the bottom can go very crispy but shouldn't burn. Serve the rice discarding the bay leaf.
9. Serve the topside with the sauce on top of the rice or next to it. You may wish to serve the meat only then use a blender with all the carrot and onion to get a smooth (and somewhat thicker) sauce to pour over the meat. I prefer it with all the pieces of onion and carrot.,

instructions, 1. Lay out 6 flan molds or  8 oz. shallow dishes out in a row or you may use a single 9" round tart pan or pie plate.
2. Now place sugar in saucepan and place directly over medium heat on the stove top. Watch closely and constantly stir. The sugar will brown and turn to liquid. (Do not add water or other liquids.)Watch closely and  do not allow the sugar to scorch. Remove from heat and distribute the caramelized sugar equally across the bottom of the flan molds. The sugar will almost immediately harden but once it is baked with the custard it will liquefy and remain liquid.
3. In a mixing bowl combine evaporated milk whole milk eggs and vanilla and whisk together until the eggs are mixed well. While mixing you may add a few tablespoons of sugar or honey to sweeten to taste. Distribute the custard mixture in the flan molds.
4. Pour about an inch of water into a large roasting pan. Set on an oven rack and then place the molds in the roasting pan. (Do not allow water level to go over the side of your flan molds.) Carefully push in the rack and close the oven door.
5. Set oven to 350*F. Do not preheat. Bake for one hour. Test for doneness by inserting a knife. If it comes out clean then the custard has fully cooked.
6. When done remove individual flans from roasting pan and place on a rack to cool.
7. Flan can be served slightly warm or chilled in the refrigerator.
8. To serve run a knife around the top of the flan where it is connected to the mold. Flip over the mold onto the serving plate and then jiggle the flan loose so that it falls in one piece onto the plate. The caramelized sugar will form a sauce over the flan. There will be hard sugar remaining in the bottom of the molds do not attempt to scrape this out to add to the sauce. Serve  and enjoy!,

This should take about 1 hour; depending on how much juice you started with you may need to add up to 1/2 cup water during simmering to keep the consistency saucy rather than dry.
4. Fish out the thyme springs. Puree the sauce with an immersion blender or a regular blender (vent the top and hold a folded dishtowel over the lid) until it's smooth if needed. Stir in the sherry vinegar. Taste and add salt and pepper if needed. The sauce should be slightly spicy and you should have about 1 1/2 cups.
5. ROAST THE POTATOES: Heat the oven to 425°F Toss the potatoes with the olive oil 1 teaspoons salt and rosemary (if using) on a large rimmed baking sheet. Roast turning the potatoes with a metal spatula every 15 minutes until they're browned and crisp outside and tender inside about 45 minutes.

instructions, 1. In a large heavy-bottomed (preferably non-stick) pot heat the olive oil and vegetable oil until hot but not smoking.  Add the potato slices onion and about ½ teaspoon salt.  Lift and turn the mixture frequently.  The potatoes will soften as they boil in the oil but should not brown.  Cook until the potatoes are soft (not mushy) and are easily cut with a knife.
2. While the potatoes cook crack the eggs into a large bowl and beat with ½ teaspoon salt until frothy.
3. When potatoes are soft remove the mixture with a slotted spoon to drain the oil and add to the beaten egg.  Gently push down the mixture until it is submerged and let rest 15 minutes.
4. Before cooking the tortilla in the skillet make sure that you have a plate that is larger than the skillet!  It may be easier to make 2 smaller tortillas than one large one.  You will also need a lid for the skillet.
5. In a non-stick (very important to use non-stick!) skillet heat 1Tablespoon oil (you can use the leftover oil from the pot) until quite hot.  Slide in the egg/potato mixture and push down to fill the skillet.  Shake the pan lower the heat to medium high and cover with a lid.  Shake the pan to prevent sticking.  When it starts to brown on the bottom (lift gently with fork to check) cover the skillet with a plate and flip the tortilla onto the plate (first flip is best done over the sink).  Slide tortilla back into skillet and cook on the other side in the same manner.  Lower heat to medium and continue to flip 4-5 more times until tortilla is cooked through – 15-20 minutes.
6. Before serving I press a paper towel onto both sides to absorb excess oil.  Serve with sliced baguette.,

6. This technique makes a hard-boiled egg that is cooked through without being tough or rubbery.
7. It also has a yolk that is a beautiful color with none of that over-cooked grayish-green rim.
8. Once the eggs have cooled; peel quarter and place into a decorative plate or bowl.

instructions, 1. This is sort of 3 recipes in 1 but it's worth the effort if you have small kids and are fighting to get them to eat something other than mac and cheese!
2. I put all of the Spanish Rice ingredients in my rice cooker and press the button - that's it.  For anybody who hasn't discovered the absolute glory of rice cookers - you can do the same thing on a stovetop - and in either case you may need to add extra water - make sure to check after about 30 minutes. Keep in mind that whole grain rice can take nearly an hour to cook.
3. The Orange Puree seems like a pain but is not hard. I do it about once a week - cut up the carrots into 1 or 1/2 inch pieces and slice up the yam - then stick that in a steamer for 20 minutes or so. If you don't have any steamer you can boil them for a similar amount of time - maybe less -  but I haven't tried boiling.
4. Make sure the carrots and yam are plenty softened then put them in your food processor (better than a blender although it can get the job done) - put at least 5 or 6 tablespoons of water - and puree until smooth. The Sneaky Chef lady says you only need 2 or 3 tablespoons - but I think it's better with a bit more.
5. This gets you maybe 2 cups of puree - which I freeze in 1/2 cup containers. I take 1 out every few days or so and it's good for 2 to 3 days once you put it in the fridge.  One day I forgot to thaw some out - and my son wanted his rice - so I chipped away at the frozen stuff and put it in the stovetop rice mix and it worked out fine.
6. Then for the final product!  Put around 1 cup of the Spanish Rice into a pan with 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 or 3 tablespoons of the Orange Puree (tablespoons can be heaping or not depending on how much of that sweet/carrot flavor you want). Add the cheese - I put around 3 oz or so - and heat up on medium-low - until the butter puree and cheese are all nicely melted and mixed.
7. Now serve to a hungry kid!  With the above recipe you'll have plenty of Spanish Rice and Orange Puree left over - freeze the extra puree and refrigerate the rice which will be good for 4 or 5 days.,

5. (While rice is simmering check it to see if you need a little more water.  I don't add much water as I don't like my rice mushy and keep in mind that the veggies added have moisture as well---be sure to taste it before serving -- I actually add more chili powder than this as I like mine spicy).
