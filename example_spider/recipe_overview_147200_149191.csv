2. Beat in sugar cream salt rum or brandy (or extract).
3. Stir in the flour.
4. This dough should be soft.
5. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
6. Roll out small amounts of dough at a time with LOTS of flour on your rolling surface put flour on top of the dough and on your rolling pin.
7. (this dough is very sticky otherwise).
8. Roll to 1/8 inch or thinner.
9. Keep the un-used dough covered to prevent drying out.
10. Cut the dough into long strips about 1 1/4 inches wide.
11. Then further cut the strips into 2 1/2 or 3 inch segments diagonally (they will look like 2 1/2 inch long and 1 1/4 inch wide diamonds.) Make a slit in the center (about 1/2 inch long in the middle lengthwise...) Grasp the bottom tail of the Khrustyky put it through the slit in the middle and pull it gently back down to the bottom.
12. (this will form a twist in the dough) continue to do this to each piece of dough.
13. (I roll out a small portion cut and form my Khrustyky and set them on a plate. Once my small bit of dough that I've rolled out is all used up I fry these in the deep fryer before moving on to another piece of dough to roll and cut).
14. Deep fry a few at a time (I'm comfortable doing 7 at a time) in oil at 375 F until light brown.
15. These puff up as you fry them making a delectible treat.
16. Drain on paper towels.
17. Sprinkle confectioner's sugar over the drained Khrustyky.

instructions, 1. For the pie shell: Mix flour salt and sugar in food processor fitted with steel blade. Scatter butter pieces over flour mixture tossing to coat butter with a little of the flour. Cut butter into flour with five 1 second pulses. Add shortening; continue cutting in until flour is pale yellow and resembles coarse cornmeal with butter bits no larger than a small pea about four more 1-second pulses. Turn mixture into medium bowl sprinkle 3 tablespoons cold water over mixture. Using rubber spatula fold water into mixture; press down on dough mixture with broad side of spatula until dough sticks together. If dough will not come together add up to 1 tablespoon more cold water. Shape dough into ball then flatten into 4-inch-wide disk. Dust lightly with flour wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling. Generously sprinkle work area with 2 tablespoons graham cracker crumbs. Place dough on work area scatter a few more crumbs over dough. Roll dough from center to edges turning it into a 9-inch disk rotating a quarter turn after each stroke and sprinkling additional crumbs underneath and on top as necessary to coat heavily. Flip dough over and continue to roll but not rotate to form a 13-inch disk slightly less than 1/8-inch thick. Fold dough into quarters; place dough point in center of 9-inch Pyrex pie pan. Unfold to cover pan completely letting excess dough drape over pan lip. To fit dough to pan lift edge of dough with one hand and press dough in pan bottom with other hand; repeat process around circumferences of pan to ensure dough fits properly and is not stretched. Trim all around 1/2-inch past lip of pan. Tuck 1/2 inch of overhanging dough under so folded edge is flush with lip of pan; press to seal. Press thumb and index finger about 1/2-inch apart against outside edge of dough then use index finger or knuckle of other hand to poke a dent on inside edge of dough through opening created by the other fingers. Repeat to flute around perimeter of pie shell. Refrigerate until firm about 30 minutes. Use fork to prick shell at 1/2-inch intervals; press a doubled 12-inch square of aluminum foil into pie shell; prick again and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
2. Adjust oven rack to lowest position heat oven to 400 degrees. Bake checking occasionally for ballooning until crust is firmly set about 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees remove foil and continue to bake until crust is crisp and rich brown in color about 10 minutes longer.
3. For the filling: Mix sugar cornstarch salt and water in a large nonreactive saucepan. Bring mixture to simmer over medium heat whisking occasionally at beginning of the process and more frequently as mixture begins to thicken. When mixture starts to simmer and turn translucent whisk in egg yolks two at a time. Whisk in zest then lemon juice and finally butter. Bring mixture to a brisk simmer whisking constantly. Remove from heat place plastic wrap directly on surface of filling to keep hot and prevent skin from forming.
4. For the meringue: Mix cornstarch with 1/3 cup water in small saucepan; bring to simmer whisking occasionally at beginning and more frequently as mixture thickens. When mixture starts to simmer and turn translucent remove from heat. Let cool while beating egg whites.
5. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Mix cream of tartar and sugar together. Beat egg whites and vanilla until frothy. Beat in sugar mixture 1 tablespoon at a time; until sugar is incorporated and mixture forms soft peaks. Add cornstarch mixture 1 tablespoon at a time; continue to beat meringue to stiff peaks. Remove plastic from filling and return to very low heat during last minute or so of beating meringue (to ensure filling is hot) pour filling into pie shell. Using a rubber spatula immediately distribute meringue evenly around edge then center of pie to keep it from sinking into filling. Make sure meringue attaches to pie crust to prevent shrinking. Use spoon to create peaks all over meringue. Bake pie until meringue is golden brown about 20 minutes. Transfer to wire rack and cool to room temperature serve.
6. Note:Sprinkle an 18-inch work area with 2 tablespoons graham cracker crumbs; place the dough disk in the center. Scatter a few more crumbs over the disk top. Roll the dough from the center to the edges to form a 9-inch disk rotating it a quarter turn after each stroke and sprinkling additional crumbs underneath and on top to heavily coat the dough. Distribute the meringue evenly around the edge then the center of the pie. Use a rubber spatula to spread the meringue making sure the meringue attaches to the pie.,

instructions, 1. Start with a ripe banana-it should be sweet and soft. Peel the banana and cut it into coins. It doesn't matter what shape or size the pieces are in as long as they are chopped up into evenly-sized and somewhat small pieces. Put the banana pieces in an airtight container. Freeze the banana pieces for at least 2 hours but ideally overnight.
2. Blend the frozen banana pieces in a small food processor or powerful blender. Pulse the frozen banana pieces. A small food processor or chopper works best. Keep blending-the banana will look crumbly.
3. Scrape down the food processor. Keep blending-the banana will look gooey. Scrape down the food processor. Keep blending-the banana will look like oatmeal: It will get smoother but still have chunks of banana in it. Scrape down the food processor.
4. Suddenly as the last bits of banana smooth out you'll see the mixture shift from blended banana to creamy soft-serve ice cream texture. Blend for a few more seconds to aerate the ice cream. (If adding any mix-ins this is the moment to do it).
5. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until solid. You can eat the ice cream immediately but it will be quite soft.,

Flip the patties over with a spatula when they start to turn brown and firm. Recheck the patties again in another 10-15 minutes and remove when done to your liking!
11. Special note: (If you want a crispier veggie burger put them under the broiler (checking frequently) for no more than 5 minutes.).,

instructions, 1. Chop your onions while you preheat a non-stick frypan or barbeque at medium heat.
2. Place all ingredients in a large bowl and mix thoroughly. I use my hands but you can use a fork or spoon. Wear gloves for safety against bacteria and food-borne illnesses!
3. If you have to let the mixture sit DO NOT mix in the oats and cornflake crumbs until just before you will cook them. Otherwise the grains absorb too mcuh liquid and get mushy making the mixture fall apart.
4. The mixture should hold together quite well and not crumble. If it does you probably need a little more of the oats and cornflake crumbs.
5. Form the mixture into 4-6 patties (depending on the size of your buns). Keep in mind these do not shrink at much as beef burgers normally do - they hardly shrink at all actually.
6. Fry or barbeque on medium heat for a few minutes per side.
7. Garnish with your favourite toppings and enjoy!,

Pour the rest of the oil over the top and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Use your hands to ensure the potatoes are coated with oil salt and pepper and evenly spread across the pan. Place them in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.

5. Dice the cheese.
6. After the fries have baked for 20 minutes remove them from the oven. Lift them with a spatula and test their tenderness with a fork. If it goes through easily the fries are ready. If you want them a little more crispy flip them over and put them back in the over for a few more minutes.
7. Once theyâre done pile one layer of fries onto a plate. Top with cheese and then the hot gravy. Repeat with a second layer before sprinkling with scallions and more freshly ground black pepper.,

instructions, 1. Heat the oven to 325Â°F Remove the neck giblets and tail (save these for the broth recipe) from the turkey as well as any plastic parts like leg connectors. Rinse the turkey well inside and out and pat it dry thoroughly with paper towels. Either stuff now or bake the stuffing separately.  Truss the turkey if you like. Rub the turkey all over with the rub.
2. For the rub:  Combine all the rub ingredients together hold back 1 1/2 tablespoonfuls of the rub and lovingly massage the rest into your turkey making sure you get some under the skin to flavour the meat underneath as well.
3. Put the turkey breast side down on a V-shaped rack in a roasting pan preferably a heavy-duty flameproof pan so that you can make the gravy in it later. Roast the turkey (with the legs pointing to the back of the oven if possible) for 1 hour.
4. With wads of paper towels in both hands lift the turkey at the neck and tail ends and flip it breast side up. Carefully rub the rest of your herbs onto the breast.  Continue roasting until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thighs reads 170Â°F another 2 to 2-1/2 hours (you also have to get a reading of 165F). While the turkey roasts baste it every 30 minutes or so with  pan drippings and rotate the pan occasionally for even browning. Transfer the turkey to a carving board or platter tent it loosely with foil and let it rest for 20 to 30 minutes (you can use the juices to make gravy at this point). Remove the trussing strings before carving.,

instructions, 1. If any silver skin on loins is present cut away and discard.
2. Sprinkle sage garlic salt and pepper all over loins. Place loins closely together lengthwise with thick ends meeting thin ends to even out roast thickness.
3. Lay out slices of bacon snugly together on a cutting board forming a rectangle. Place loins across bacon so bacon ends emerge from each side. Beginning at one end lift a bacon end up over loins at a 45Â° angle. Then alternating sides continue lifting bacon ends down the length of roast forming a chevron pattern of bacon on top.
4. Cut five 12-inch (30-cm) lengths of twine and one 30-inch (75-cm) length. Place 5 shorter lengths of twine under loins widthwise. Working out from roast centre firmly (but not causing deep indents to form) tie up each piece of twine spacing evenly apart. Then tie up roast lengthwise with longer piece of twine. Trim twine ends; discard. (Roast can be prepared covered and refrigerated for up to half a day. Add 10 to 15 minutes to roasting time.).
5. When ready to roast preheat oven to 425Â°F (220Â°C).
6. Heat a large frying pan over medium heat. Lightly brown roast on all sides about 15 minutes in total.
7. Transfer to a baking pan lined with a rack. Place in oven; set time for 30 minutes. Check and continue roasting until a meat thermometer reads 145Â°F (63Â°C).
8. Remove from oven: transfer to cutting board. Cover roast with foil; let rest 15 to 20 minutes.
9. Meanwhile peel core and slice apples. Thinly slice onion.
10. Drain most of fat from frying pan; place back over medium heat. Add onion; cook 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Stir in flour; cook 1 minute. Stir in chicken broth; add apple slices.
11. Bring to a boil; simmer covered 5 to 10 minutes or until apples are tender and sauce is lightly thickened. Add more broth if too thick; keep covered and hot.
12. To slice pork roast snip off lengthwise string. Then slice about Â¾ inch (2 cm) thick removing crosswise strings as they are encountered.
13. Place a few saucy apples on each warm serving plate top with a couple of slices of roast and drizzle with more sauce. Serve with mashed potatoes and a steamed julienne of carrots.,

instructions, 1. 1. In a large bowl mix together pudding mix pineapple with juice marshmallows and nuts. Fold in whipped topping. Chill.
2. My Note:   This is a good recipe that you may needs some modifications. To get the pineapple to pudding mix ration right I make it with a 20 ounce can of fruit with two boxes of pudding adding double the whipped cream. Sometimes it is good to add coconut as well.
3. Sometime I would add more pineapple than called for - I used a 20-oz. can of (unsweetened) pineapple chunks. The second time I made this I wanted to make it less soupy (adding all the juice was just too much liquid) so I drained the entire 20-oz. can of pineapple (chunks) into a measuring cup then added 1/2 cup juice to the pudding. Letting it sit overnight is key as it will taste too much like unprepared pudding if you don't. I used pecans instead of walnuts and cut down on the amount (used 1/4 cup instead of 1/2) and would do that again. I also used the entire 8-oz. tub of whipped topping.
4. My wilf had tons of requests at a baby shower for this recipe. Here it is wath she did -- 2 (3.4 oz) packages of instant pistachio pudding 2 (20oz) cans of crushed pineapple drained (1/4 cup reserved juice) 1/2 cup chopped walnuts 1(16 oz) cool whip thawed. Fold all ingredients into the cool whip and chill for several hours.,

instructions, 1. Choose a casserole or baking dish with just enough room to lay the pears head to tail in a single layer.
2. Peel the pears thinly leaving the stalks on and then immediately roll each one in a saucer containing the juice of the lemon.
3. Put the pears into the dish.
4. Spoon on a scant 4 tablespoons of maple syrup and add any lemon juice remaining in the saucer.
5. Bring the grape juice to simmering point and pour it over the pears.
6. Cover the dish and bake at 350Â°F until the fruit is beautifully tender.
7. How long this will take varies enormously- 1 hour is enough for semi-ripe dessert pears; 3 hours or more may be needed for pears that are so hard that they seem to be carved from wood.
8. Baste the pears frequently as they bake and turn them occasionally to encourage even cooking.
9. When the pears are ready transfer them to a serving dish standing them upright.
10. Boil the cooking liquid until it turns syrupy and is reduced by about half.
11. Stir in an extra tablespoon or two of maple if you think a little more sweetness is desirable but avoid the temptation to make the juices too sweet; the appeal of the dish lies in its fruitiness.
12. Spoon the syrupy glaze over the pears.
13. Serve warm or cold.,
