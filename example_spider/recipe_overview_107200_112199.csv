10. Note:.
11. Use a head of cabbage that has been in your refrigerator a while; try not to use a new cabbage. Why? The old one seems to hold up better in the cooking. Age has its rewards.
12. A tasty sausage sliced or smoked pork hock can also substitute for the bacon but there ought to be some flavor and fat in it. I sometimes add a couple of bouillon cubes too.,

6. There are two methods for making the Spaetzle but in both cases they should be prepared in batches: 1) on a small board spread some of the dough flat and over the boiling water use a chef's knife to cut thin strips or ribbons and push them into the water. 2) using a potato ricer or spaetzle press take a portion of dough and extrude the spaetzle into the boiling water.
7. With either method when the spaetzle float to the top they are done skim them off rinse them in cold water and brown for a minute or two in a skillet with some of the sauteed onions.

2. Begin by pounding out the chicken breast gently between 2 pieces of plastic wrap.
3. Prepare a breading station with flour whisked eggs and milk and panko crumbs. Season all with salt and pepper. Coat the breasts in flour egg then panko. Lay the coated breasts out on a flat tray and refrigerate to let the crust dry out (about 10 minutes) this will ensure there is less moisture and less chance your coating will break when frying.
4. Shallow fry the paillard in hot oil for approximately 2 to 3 minutes per side depending on how thick the breasts are. Drain well season with salt and set aside when done.
5. For the dressing:
6. Put the anchovies egg yolks garlic lemon juice and water into a blender and process for 30 seconds until the mixture is smooth. With the blender running pour the olive oil in slowly for the dressing to emulsify. Stir in the Parmesan season with salt and a couple of grinds of black pepper; set aside. (Refrigerate the dressing if you will not be using it right away.).
7. Prepare the salad by splitting the grape tomatoes in half through the middle lengthwise mixing all ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Add the dressing and toss the salad well.
8. To serve lay the warm crispy chicken paillard on the base of the plate and top with the salad. Garnish with shaved parmesan cheese a wedge of lemon and a drizzle of olive oil.

2. (ad ingredients:  026 gallons of veil schnitzel (already 1cm (04 inch) "thick" sliced) (=800g).
3. Do tenderise meat by hammering on it with a pan. (in Austrian we have special "Schnitzelklopfer" or "Plattiereisen" to do so) In the end it shall be about half a centimeter (so 02 inches). - caution! it gets loud! ;).
4. Then salt and pepper each Schnitzel.
5. Heat the oil (or the Schmalz) in a pan.
6. Then turn the meat in the farina draw it through the slightly mixed eggs and finally put it onto the bread crumbs. Press the bread crumbs onto each side of the Schnitzel so it´s all covered with our "coat".
7. Put a tiny amount of bread crumbs into the oil. when they swim on the surface of the oil: the oil is ready. if they soak the oil up and "fall to the ground of the pan" - > oil not hot enough.
8. so when the oil is really hot (bread crumbs get golden-brown immediately) put as many Schnitzel into you pan as can be without touching each other. They shall swim in the oil. Often turn them around.
9. We have such a high temperature (and the meat is thin enough) that they are ready to serve as soon as they are golden-brown. Which can be after a minute or maybe (if you don´t want to go to such high temperatures) 4 minutes.
10. Hope i helped a little and you enjoy the original recipe of a (Wiener) Schnitzel. :).

instructions, 1. To prepare for baking seven layers (the usual number): Tear off seven piece of aluminum foil or baking pan liner paper (NOTE 1) each about 11-inches long.
2. Spread softened butter lightly over a 10-inch square area in the center of each piece of foil or paper.
3. Sprinkle with flour.
4. Shake and tilt the foil or paper to make sure the buttered area is thoroughly floured and shake off any excess.
5. On the floured area trace a 9-inch circle.
6. (Use any 9-inch circular object as a pattern: the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan an inverted 9-inch cake tin or a 9-inch pot cover.) Repeat with remaining pieces of foil or paper.
7. Set aside.
8. Place rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees.
9. In the large bowl of an electric mixer at high speed beat the 10 egg yolks for a few minutes til they are pale and lemon-colored.
10. Reduce speed and gradually add sugar.
11. Increase speed to high again and beat for 5 minutes or until very thick.
12. Reduce speed and gradually add the flour then again increase it to high and beat for 5 minutes more (mixture will be almost stiff) scraping the bowl occasionally with a rubber spatula.
13. Mix in the lemon juice and remove from the mixer.
14. (The mixture will be very thick-use your fingers to get it all off the beaters.) Beat the seven whites with the salt until they hold a point- stiff but not dry.
15. Since the yolk mixture is very thick actually stir a few spoonfuls of the whites in to lighten it a bit.
16. Then fold in a few large spoonfuls three or four times til the mixture lightens.
17. Gently fold in the remaining whites.
18. With a large serving spoon place two or three large spoonfuls of the batter on one of the pieces of prepared foil or paper.
19. Using the back of the spoon spread the batter thin slowly rotaing the paper with your left hand as you spread the batter with your right hand.
20. Make it thin but do not leave any holes in it.
21. A 1/4- inch thickness should give you seven layers.
22. Do not make the edges too thin.
23. Follow the lines closely but don't worry the edges can be trimmed later.
24. Slide a cookie sheet under the foil or paper and bake for 5 to 7 minutes or until the top is golden brown with dark brown spots.
25. If the layers are thicker than mine are they will take longer to bake.
26. If they are not baked long enough they will stick to the foil or paper.
27. Repeat with remaining layers.
28. If you bake more than one layer at a time rotate the positions of the pans during baking to insure even browning.
29. When a layer is baked and out of the oven lift the corners of the foil or paper and invert onto a rack.
30. Peel off the paper and immediately invert the layer onto another rack to cool right side up.
31. (Letting the layer cool upside down will make it stick to the rack.) When you run out of racks layers may cool on smooth toweling that has been dusted with confectioner's sugar.
32. When you run out of room cooled layers may be stacked if you sprinkle the tops lightly with confectioner's sugar and place wax paper between them.
33. Cooled layers may be trimmed to even the edges.
34. Working on a board place an 8-1/2 inch or 9-inch pot cover or cake pan on the layer.
35. Cut around with a small sharp knife and then cut with scissors.
36. FILLING AND ICING: Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over hot water on moderate heat.
37. Remove from heat stir until smooth and set aside to cool completely.
38. In small bowl of electric mixer cream the butter.
39. Add vanilla and egg yolks and beat well.
40. Add sugar and cooled chocolate.
41. Beat until thoroughly mixed scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula.
42. Place four strips of wax paper around the outer edges of a cake plate.
43. Place one cake layer on the plate and with a long narrow metal spatula spread with a thin layer of the chocolate filling.
44. If you have made more than seven layers the filling must be spread very thin in order to have enough for all.
45. Place another layer on top adjusting it carefully so that the edges are lined up evenly.
46. Continue icing the layers stacking them as evenly as possible.
47. Spread the remaining chocolate smoothly around the sides first and then over the top.
48. Remove wax paper strips by pulling each one out by a narrow end and refrigerate cake for at least several hours to set the icing.
49. Store in refrigerator and serve cold.
50. NOTES:If you use baking pan liner paper it must be buttered and flourd for this recipe or the layers will stick to it.
51. This is a very firm cake; use a sharp heavy knife for serving.
52. Dobosh Torte may be made a day ahead or it may be frozen.
53. For a variation you can put cherry raspberry or strawberry jam or preserves between one or two layers instead of the chocolate filling.,

instructions, 1. For the aioli: Put the chopped rosemary into a little saucepan with 3 tablespoons of oil and warm gently for 2 or 3 minutes careful not to burn. Keep aside
2. Put the egg yolks into a bowl with the mustard salt and the white wine vinegar and add the crushed garlic.
3. Put the oil into a measuring cup. Take a whisk in one hand and the oil in the other and drip the oil onto the egg yolks drop by drop whisking at the same time. Within a minute you will notice that the mixture is beginning to thicken. When this happens you can add the oil a little faster but don't get too cheeky or it will suddenly curdle because the egg yolks can only absorb the oil at a certain pace. Taste and add a little more seasoning and vinegar if necessar.
4. If the mayonnaise curdles it will suddenly become quite thin and if left sitting the oil will start to float to the top of the sauce. If this happens you can quite easily rectify the situation by putting another egg yolk or 1 to 2 tablespoons plus 1 to 2 teaspoons of boiling water into a clean bowl. Then whisk in the curdled mayonnaise a half teaspoon at a time until it emulsifies again.

instructions, 1. Beat the egg whites until they are very stiff.
2. Sieve the powdered sugar into the beaten egg whites and continue to beat until the mixture is very glossy.
3. Put aside about five tablespoons of this mixture in a covered dish or container.
4. Add the cinnamon lemon juice and ground nuts to the egg whites and mix thoroughly.
5. (important) Refrigerate the dough (covered with buttered plastic wrap or foil) for at least an hour.
6. Sprinkle a large piece of baking parchment with powdered sugar and put the dough on it. More powdered sugar on the dough and another layer of baking parchment.  Don't skimp on the powdered sugar as it is important in the next step.
7. Roll the dough out quickly and with a light hand until it's about one centimeter thick. If the dough begins to stick to the parchment peel it back and sprinkle more powdered sugar.
8. Cut into star shapes with a small cookie cutter dipping it into sugar if the dought gets sticky.  Alternatively if you don't want to fuss with a cookie cutter (I really dislike the fuss myself) you can cut the rolled out dough into long strips and the strips into triangles.
9. Line a cookie sheet with more baking parchment and put the stars or triangles on the cookie sheet. They don't spread so you can put a lot on a single sheet.
10. Use the reserved beaten egg white/sugar mixture to frost the cookies (quickly).
11. If possible set the cookies on the sheet back in the refrigerator to cool down.
12. These are not so much baked as they are dried out in the oven. The temperature shouldn't be higher than 140 celsius about a half hour or until very lightly colored.
13. Let them cool on the sheet.
14. Note: the preparation time includes the refrigeration of the dough.,

4. Line a large nonstick springform pan with parchment paper and fill with the batter.
5. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 F (175 C or gas mark 2) for 30 minutes - it will only rise up partway.
6. Let cool completely.
7. Meanwhile heat 1/2 cup of the cream in a small pan over medium-low heat then stir in the milk chocolate until it melts and is smooth(takes about 5 minutes.)
8. Remove pan from heat and let cool for 1 hour at room temperature.
9. Finely grate the bittersweet chocolate using a microplane grater and divide into two portions.
10. Beat 1 1/2 cups of the cream until stiff peaks form.
11. Stir chopped nuts and half (one portion) of the grated chocolate gently into the cooled melted chocolate mixture.

16. Chill for 2 hours.
17. Knead the marzipan(with enough powdered sugar to make it sweet if unsweetened) until well blended and soft like playdough this takes about 5-10 minutes by hand (optional: you may use food coloring paste to dye the marzipan green if desired.)
18. Place marzipan between two sheets of wax papper and roll out into very flat circle about the size of your springform pan.
19. Set a plate on top of the marzipan and use the plate as a guide to cut out a perfect circle; then cut circle into 16 triangles.
20. Set the marzipan triangles in a spiral around the top of the chilled cake pressing down slightly so they stick - there should be very narrow gaps between each triangle - if desired curl up the pointy tips decoratively first.
21. Coat the sides of the cake with some the remaining grated chocolate (save just a bit to sprinkle on top later).
22. Beat the remaining 3/4 cups of cream with the vanilla sugar to taste until stiff peaks form.

instructions, 1. Cream the butter in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer) until soft and fluffy. Add the egg yolks and vanilla and mix well.
2. Mix the granulated sugar flour baking powder and salt together. Add to the butter and egg yolk mixture and mix just until incorporated and the dough starts to come together. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and form into two balls. Wrap each ball in plastic wrap and freeze at least 2 hours or overnight (or as long as a month if you like).
3. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease a 8x8 or 9x9 square baking pan or a 10-inch tart pan with removable bottom. (I use Baker's Joy spray).
4. Remove one ball of dough from the freezer and coarsely grate it by hand or with the grating disk in a food processor into the bottom of the greased baking pan (or tart pan). Make sure the surface is covered evenly with shreds of dough.
5. Gently mix the blueberries raspberries and the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Mix sugar flour lemon zest in a small bowl until combined then add to blueberry/raspberry mixture and mix gently with your hand to coat the berries with the flour mixture.
6. Cover the bottom layer of dough with the blueberry mixture as evenly as possible gently pressing the berries into the dough. Remove the remaining dough from the freezer and coarsely grate it over the entire surface. (I grate this second ball of dough onto a piece of plastic wrap then sprinkle over the berries.).
7. Place in oven and cover lightly with foil bake for 20 minutes then remove foil. Continue baking until lightly golden brown and the center no longer wiggles about 20-30 minutes longer. Remove from oven and allow to cool.
8. After the shortbread is cooled sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired or drizzle with lemon glaze. For lemon glaze mix 1/2 cup powdered sugar with 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Add enough milk 1 teaspoon at a time to thin out to thick drizzling consistency.
9. Cool on a wire rack then cut in the pan with a serrated knife. Chilling the pan in the fridge makes it a lot easier to get clean cuts.

instructions, 1. Lamb  --  Mix the olive oil red wine vinegar garlic fresh rosemary oregano and red pepper flakes in a baggie and add the lamb. I like to marinade the lamb at least 2-3 hours. Remove from the fridge and let it come to room temperature while you make the dressing and the salad.
2. Dressing  --  Mix the yogurt lemon juice and zest honey scallions garlic salt pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
3. Salad  --  In a large bowl add the lettuce cucumber olives and chickpeas and toss well.  Reserve the cherries and raisins for the topping as well as feta cheese which is optional.
4. Lamb  --  The lamb already has some olive oil in the marinade so I spray a grill pan or saute pan just with Pam or a non-stick spray and grill on medium high to high heat. They literally just take a minute or two on each side. I like my meat medium rare.
5. Finish  --  Add the warm grilled lamb to the salad add the chilled yogurt dressing toss lightly garnish with the cherries and raisins.
6. Feta cheese is another optional garnish which I like just a little but it is optional. And Grilled pia chips are perfect with this as well.,

instructions, 1. In a large bowl mix the dressing and balsamic vinegar together for a minute or two until well combined.
2. Add the other ingredients. There is no order that works best here; the dish is meant to be a simple and rustic one.
3. If you are using the olives feel free to add them at this time. My husband isn't fond of olives so when I make this dish I typically add them to my portion alone so that he doesn't have to "weed" them out. If there are no picky eaters in your family then just toss them in!
4. Toss the salad until all the ingredients are coated in the dressing.
5. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least one hour before serving. This will give the dressing time to thicken up and further coat the other ingredients.
6. Serve and enjoy! This is a great compliment to just about any dish and is wonderful for those summer meals when you're looking for something nice and cool to relax with!,

Fold in the flour mixed with the baking powder then stir in the rum. Carefully fold the stiffly beaten egg whites into the batter. Turn the batter into a buttered and floured pan (one 8 by 12 inch cake pan OR one 10-inch cake pan)  and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for about 30 minutes or until a tester inserted in the cake comes out clean.
2. Remove the cake from the oven and prick the entire surface with a toothpick. Pour the hot syrup over the cake before the cake cools. When the cake has cooled fold 1 teaspoon of sugar into the whipped cream and frost the cake lavishly with the sweetened cream. Cut the cake into squares and sprinkle with the remaining almonds. Decorate with the cherries.
3. FOR THE SUGAR SYRUP: Stir the sugar and water together in a deep heavy saucepan set over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. During this period use a dampened pastry brush to wipe down any stray sugar crystals that cling to the sides of the pan.
4. When the sugar has dissolved bring the syrup to a boil. Take of the heat and add fresh lemon juice and 1 tablespoons rum. This will make about 2 cups syrup.

2. Warm milk in large heavy pan; add 1 1/2 cups sugar and butter. Heat over medium high heat stirring frequently to prevent scorching bring to a boil (do not allow milk to boil over). Remove pan from heat and gradually stir in cream of wheat. Stir rapidly to prevent lumping. Return pan to medium heat stirring constantly bring back to a full rolling boil. Boil 1 minute. Remove from heat. Stir occasionally while cooling slightly (stirring prevents lumps and a thick crust forming on top). Mixture will continue to thicken as it cools.
3. While cream of wheat is cooling beat eggs and vanilla until very frothy and thick. Gradually stir eggs into still warm custard mixture. Continue to stir custard until eggs are thoroughly mixed. Pour custard mixture into prepared pan; smooth and lightly shake to level custard. Bake 40-50 minutes or until a tooth pick inserted in center comes out clean and the color is golden brown.
4. While custard is baking prepare syrup by combining 2 cups sugar and 1 3/4 cups hot water. Partially squeeze lemon wedges in syrup then drop wedge into syrup. Break stick of cinnamon in half and add. Bring to a boil stirring frequently to dissolve sugar. Once mixture boils and sugar is dissolved reduce heat to low. Cover and cook to 210-218 degrees (syrup cooked to this stage will fall in a thin stream from a cold spoon).* Discard lemon and cinnamon.
5. Remove cooked custard from oven and baste with warm syrup. Start basting edges and corners first syrup will puddle to the center. Syrup will soak into custard as custard cools. It may take a few minutes to completely add syrup. Cool. Sprinkle with ground cinnamon. Cut into squares or diamond shapes and serve with a maraschino cherry if desired.,

instructions, 1. Using a potato peeler or shap knife remove six 1-inch wide by 3-inch long strips from the orange peel and set aside. Be careful not to cut too deeply and remove any white part from the skin as it will add a bitter flavor. Cut the oranges in half. Use a fruit juicer to squeeze the oranges. Strain the juice through a small hand strainer to catch any seeds. Measure 1 1/2 cups juice and pour into a medium sized bowl. Repeat this step with the lemons measuring 1/2 cup and combine with the orange juice. Add three of the peeled orange strips to the juice and set aside. Lay the other three orange strips on top of each other and cut them into long thin strips. Then cut or mince the strips into tiny pieces and put in a small bowl and set aside.
2. Syrup: Put the confectioners' sugar orange peel and the citrus juices in a 2-3 quart saucepan and place over low heat. Stir well to dissolve the sugar and combine all the ingredients. Heat the mixture slowly and bring to a gentle boil. This will take 6-8 minutes. Reduce to a simmer and let it cook uncovered for 20 minutes while you prepare the cake.
3. Preheat oven to 350.
4. Butter a 12x18-inch ovenproof baking pan and set aside. Combine the flour Cream Of Wheat baking powder and baking soda together into a medium bowl. Sift the combined ingredients into a separate bowl. Melt butter slowly over low heat being careful it doesn't burn. In a large bowl beat the eggs on high with an electric mixer for 2 minutes or until light and foamy. Add granulated sugar and the minced orange pieces and contine to beat for another 1-2 minutes or until eggs and sugar are smooth golden and creamy. Turn the beater to low and add about 1 cup of the flour mixture and blend well. Add a little of the melted butter and blend well. Add another cup of the flour mixture and then a little more of the butter. Continue until all the butter and flour are combined into a smooth batter. Turn off the mixer and remove the beaters. Using a rubber spatula scape off any batter from the beaters into the bowl. Add the yogurt to the bowl. With a rubber spatula or wooden spoon fold or gently combine the ingredients in the batter.
5. Pour the batter into the buttered baking pan. Place the pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake the cake for 45 minutes to 1 hour until golden brown and firm when pressed lightly in its center. Remove the cake from the oven and place on a wire rack.
6. Make several holes in the surface of the cake with a butter knife or a wooden chopstick. Remove the strips of orange peels from the syrup and discard. Now pour the syrup evenly over the top of the cake. Let the cake stand at least 2 hours to absorb the syrup. When you are ready to serve the cake place the confectioners' sugar in a hand strainer and gently tap the side to sprinkle the sugar over the top. Cut into small squares and serve.,

2. Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a 13 x 9 inch metal baking pan with melted butter.
3. Pastry: in a small bowl combine the walnuts almonds sugar cinnamon cardamom and cloves; set aside.
4. On a clean work surface lay flat 1 sheet of phyllo and brush it lightly with melted butter.
5. Layer 7 more sheets of phyllo over the first buttering each one.
6. Carefully lay this stack of butter phyllo in the prepared pan.
7. Sprinkle evenly with 1 cup of the nut mixture.
8. Layer together 8 more sheets of phyllo buttering each sheet and lay this stack over the first layer of nuts.
9. Sprinkle the second stack of phyllo sheets with another 1 cup of the nut mixture.
10. Repeat this process until there are 5 stacks of buttered phyllo (8 sheets in each stack) separated by and ending with a layer of nut mixture (1 cup for each of 5 layers).
11. On a flat work surface prepare the top of the pastry by layering together 35 sheets of phyllo dough buttering each sheet.
12. Carefully place this stack of layered phyllo over the last layer of nuts in the pan.
13. The pan should be completely full of pastry.
14. With a sharp knife score the baklava into square or diamond-shape pieces by cutting through just the top layers of phyllo dough.
15. Bake until crisp throughout and the top layers are golden brown 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
16. While the baklava is baking make the honey syrup: combine all the syrup ingredients in a large stockpot and bring the syrup to a boil over med-high heat.
17. Decrease heat to medium and simmer until the mixture is the consistency of thick maple syrup about 10 minutes.
18. Remove the syrup from the heat and let cool slightly.
19. As soon as the baklava comes out of the oven spoon the slightly warm syrup over the pastry.
20. Let the baklava cool completely before cutting the scored pieces completely.
21. Don't be nervous if the baklava seems to be swimming in the syrup initially.
22. As the pastry cools the syrup is absorbed into the layers.
23. It is very important to allow the baklava to cool completely giving the syrup plenty of time to ease into the pastry layers and give the baklava its wonderful gooey-crisp texture.
24. Baklava will keep covered for 2 days at room temperature or 4 days refrigerated.,

instructions, 1. Put the corn oil butter beer (or orange juice) cinnamon cloves orange peel and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat until they are thoroughly blended.
2. Sift about one cup of flour with the baking soda baking powder and salt and blend into the oil mixture.
3. Add the semolina a cup at a time into this mixture.
4. Add enough of the remaining flour a cup at a time until you get a rather firm dough (you may need a bit more or less than the amount of flour mentioned in the ingredients list).
5. Use your hands to do the mixing as an electric mixer will be useless after the first two or three cups of flour have been added.
6. Roll the dough into cylinders about two inches long and one inch in diameter flatten them with your hands and place them on cookie sheets that have been greased with a little olive oil.
7. Bake at 350 degree Fahrenheit for half an hour.
8. Remove the cookies from the oven and pour hot syrup over them.
9. Lay the cookies out in a rimmed baking pan large enough to contain them and pour the hot syrup over the cookies sprinkle them with the chopped walnuts and let them soak overnight.
10. (Alternatively if you do not have enough rimmed baking sheets to accommodate all the cookies you can dip them in batches directly into the hot syrup - keeping the syrup at the lowest possible simmer - and allow to soak in the syrup for 8-10 minutes; remove with a slotted spoon).
11. For the syrup: mix the sugar honey and water and bring to a boil.
12. Cook on low heat for four minutes and skim off the foam that forms on top.
13. The next day put them on your prettiest platter sprinkle each layer evenly with the finely chopped walnuts and wrap with plastic wrap (or put in an airtight container) and serve.
14. These are great keepers and will last for months (my Mom's 'big' batches sometimes made it nearly up until Easter!).,

9. A word about kataïfi dough:
10. This dough comes commercially packaged in a long strip about 3 inches wide. To prepare it for this recipe lay the long strip out on a clean work surface and divide it into 18-24 pieces gently spreading the strands out a bit if they clump together. Each piece will be used to create an individual kataïfi roll. Keep unused dough covered with a piece of waxed paper and a damp towel on top of that to keep it from drying out.
11. Brush a strip with melted butter.
12. Place a tablespoon of the filling at one end of the strip and roll up into a cylinder tucking in any stray pieces of dough. Take care to roll the pastry tightly so that the filling is securely enclosed.
13. Place the rolls seam side down in a lightly buttered baking dish close together but not squashed and brush well with butter. Bake for 45-60 minutes until golden brown and crispy looking.
14. Remove from oven pour cool syrup over the pastry and cover with a clean towel. Let cool about 3-4 hours as it absorbs the syrup.

instructions, 1. . For the sugar syrup: Combine syrup ingredients except rosewater in small saucepan and bring to full boil over medium-high heat stirring occasionally to ensure that sugar dissolves. Transfer to 2-cup measuring cup and set aside to cool while making and baking baklava; when syrup is cool discard peppercorns and stir in rosewater. (Cooled syrup can be refrigerated in airtight container up to 4 days.).
2. Nut filling: Pulse pistachios in food processor until very finely chopped about fifteen 1-second pulses; transfer to bowl. Measure out 1 tablespoon nuts and set aside for garnish. Add ground cardamom sugar and salt; toss well to combine.
3. To assemble and bake: Brush 13- by 9-inch traditional (not nonstick) baking pan with butter. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Unwrap and unfold phyllo on large cutting board; carefully smooth with hands to flatten. Using baking pan as guide cut sheets crosswise with chef’s knife yielding two roughly evenly sized stacks of phyllo (one may be narrower than other). Cover with plastic wrap then damp kitchen towel to prevent drying.
4. Place one phyllo sheet (from wider stack) in bottom of baking pan and brush until completely coated with butter. Repeat with 7 more phyllo sheets (from wider stack) brushing each with butter.
5. Evenly distribute about 1 cup nuts over phyllo. Cover nuts with phyllo sheet (from narrower stack) and dab with butter (phyllo will slip if butter is brushed on). Repeat with 5 more phyllo sheets (from narrower stack) staggering sheets slightly if necessary to cover nuts and brushing each with butter. Repeat layering with additional 1 cup nuts 6 sheets phyllo and remaining 1 cup nuts. Finish with 8 to 10 sheets phyllo (from wider stack) using nicest and most intact sheets for uppermost layers and brushing each except final sheet with butter. Following illustration 6 use palms of hands to compress layers working from center outward to press out any air pockets. Spoon 4 tablespoons butter on top layer and brush to cover all surfaces. Following illustration 7 use bread knife or other serrated knife with pointed tip in gentle sawing motion to cut baklava into diamonds rotating pan as necessary to complete cuts. (Cut on bias into eighths on both diagonals.).
6. Bake until golden and crisped about 1 ½ hours rotating baking pan halfway through baking. Immediately after removing baklava from oven pour cooled syrup over cut lines until about 2 tablespoons remain (syrup will sizzle when it hits hot pan); drizzle remaining syrup over surface. Garnish center of each piece with pinch of reserved ground nuts. Cool to room temperature on wire rack about 3 hours then cover with foil and let stand at least 8 hours before serving. (Once cooled baklava can be served but flavor and texture improve if left to stand at least 8 hours. Baklava can be wrapped tightly in foil and kept at room temperature up to 10 days.).,

2. Add the flour baking powder and vanilla and mix until you have a pliable dough that doesn't stick to the sides of the mixing bowl (you may need to add a bit more flour as this recipe is from metric and actually calls for a kilo of flour which equals 2.2 lbs).
3. Shape the dough into whatever shapes you desire.  In Greece we shape it into rings snails Ss braids - you are only limited by your imagination.  Do try to keep the shape down to a size that will comfortably fit into your coffee cup for dunking though - and remember - they'll puff up in baking.  Brush shapes with water and sprinkle generously with sesame seeds.  Place on greased cookie sheets or parchment-lined cookie sheets or silpat.

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350F (330F for convection ovens). Beat/whip one stick of butter in an electric mixer until fluffy.
2. While the butter is being whipped in the mixer dry roast a generous half cup of slivered almonds in a pan until they come fragrant. Remove from heat. Place the toasted almond slivers into a food processor and process until they are nearly a flour. (Stop just before you reach flour consistency as the heat will cause the oils in the almond 'flour' to coalesce which you want to avoid. A course flour is the proper point at which to to stop blending.) Place almond flour in a bowl.
3. Add 1/4 cup sugar to whipped butter and continue to mix. Add remaining ingredients: 2 egg whites (or 4 tsps of dry egg white + 1/4 cup water) 1 tsp baking powder 3 tsp ouzo 3 tsp rose water dash of vanila extract 2 cups flour and almond 'flour.'.
4. The result should be just thick enough to handle with your hands after dashing a large spoonful of the mixture with a little flour. Form into a rough ball and flatten just slightly. (If the consistency isn't right go back and add a little flour or water to the cookie dough if necessary to achieve desired consistency.) Repeat with each cookie adding cookies to oiled/buttered cookie sheet. The mixture should make about 12 medium to large sized cookies.
5. Bake for 15 mins or until the cookies begin forming a slightly golden exterior. After removing from oven sprinkle with a little (okay a lot of) powdered sugar.,

instructions, 1. To make the syrup combine the honey and the water and heat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave.
2. Sift the flour with the baking powder into a bowl and set aside.
3. Using a mixer beat the egg yolks and whole egg on high speed until the eggs are thick and smooth and the color is light yellow about 4 -5 minutes.
4. Combine the melted butter orange juice and brandy. With the mixer running add to the egg mixture until incorporated.
5. Add the flour 1/2 cup at a time until the dough comes together and doesn’t stick to the sides of the bowl.
6. If you have a dough hook for your mixer you can attach it and knead the dough with the machine. If not turn the dough out on to a lightly floured surface and knead by hand. Continue kneading the dough until it has a smooth and elastic texture about 5 – 8 minutes.
7. Separate the dough into four pieces and let it rest covered with plastic wrap for about 30 minutes.
8. After the dough has rested roll out each section into rectangles. The dough should be very thin about 1/16th of an inch thick (the thickness of a piece of cardboard).
9. Using a knife or rolling cutter cut the dough into sheets that are about 5 inches wide and about 10 inches long. Lay the cut pieces on a tray separated by wax paper sheets to prevent them from sticking together.
10. To fry you will need a pan with a wide bottom and a depth of about 4 – 5 inches. The oil will need to about 3 inches deep.
11. The Diples cook quickly so be sure to have your ingredients tools and dough strips in place.
12. Heat the oil or vegetable shortening until shimmering but not smoking hot. If the oil is too hot the diples will cook too quickly making it difficult to roll them.
13. Place a strip of dough in the hot oil. Using two large cooking forks hold the end furthest away from you and roll the sheet away from you. You can pierce the sheet with the fork or simply place the edge between the tines of the fork.
14. Hold the roll in the oil until both sides are a light golden color.
15. Drain and remove the rolls to a tray layered with paper towels and stand them on their ends to prevent them from becoming mushy.
16. Place the diples on a serving platter and drizzle with the syrup. Sprinkle with ground walnuts and ground cinnamon.
17. To keep the diples crisp do not add the syrup until just before you are ready to serve.,

5. Pour 1 tablespoon of pineapple juice from can over each ladyfinger biscuit soaking them well.
6. Cover biscuits with half of the cream and cover with pineapple rings. ( I prefer to chop the rings and then scatter them over the cream layer as it makes it easier to slice).
7. Add another biscuit layer over the pineapple and soak with the remaining pineapple juice.
8. Cover with the remaining cream and smooth the layer well.
9. Arrange pineapple rings over the top and insert the glace cherries into the holes of the rings.

11. Edited to add: I recently made this with one tin sliced pineapple and one tin peach halves. I mixed the juices from the tins and decorated the layers and the top with both types of fruit. Personally I liked this version even better than the original one I posted and encourage anyone interested to try different combinations of fruit.,

6. NOTE:  You can also pipe the almond paste onto the baking sheets through a pastry tube as is traditionally done.
7. MACAROONS GREEK-AMERICAN STYLE.
8. When the Greeks were introduced to chocolate they went quite treloi “crazy” for it and now dozens of chocolate treats fill the display  cases in sweet stores. Chocolate is not however much used in home baking.  In a Greek-American touch a drizzle of chocolate adds just enough of the rich taste without overwhelming the subtleties of the macaroons.
9. Heat the chocolate pieces and liquid together in a small saucepan or in a microwave oven until the chocolate is soft but not bubbling about 1 minutes.  Whisk to smooth the mixture and then heat it a few seconds longer until it is runny but not boiling.  Brush or drizzle a little of the chocolate over the top of each macaroon.  Set aside to cool until the chocolate hardens about 10 minutes.  Serve right away or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.

3. Add flour mixture to the butter and stir with the hand until all the flour is absorbed. You will notice that the dough will become very fragile and it should be like that.
4. Add the nuts and the rum (or brandy) and continue mixing well with your hand.
5. The right kourambies dough should just hold itself together.
6. Form round cookies 1 inch diameter and press them softly with your finger at the top. Don't worry if it gets easily destroyed. That's the way it should be. Apply small pressure and everything will go fine :).
7. Place in a baking sheet (keep some distance between them as they will rise softly).
8. Bake in preheated oven at 200°F (390°F) for 15 minutes. They should become lightly golden. I like mine baked until golden brown but the traditional ones shouldn't have color. Try for yourself and pick your favorite.
9. Let them cool completely. Arrange a layer in a dish and sift icing sugar on top. Repeat with the next layer. The amount of icing sugar really depends on your taste. I recommend a 3mm layer of icing sugar on top but again find your favorite quantity.
10. Keep them airtight because they become soft very easily when left exposed in humidity and that's something terrible for a kourambies cookie.
11. This recipe requires some kitchen experience so don't be easily disappointed if at first you don't succeed.,

instructions, 1. Cube the chicken. I usually cut each breast into 5 pieces.
2. In a large non metallic bowl put the yoghurt honey olive oil oregano lemon juice and garlic salt and mix well to combine.
3. Add the cubed chicken and mix well again. The chicken now needs to be left to marinate. I usually put the meat and the marinade into a large freezer bag to ensure it is really covered. Marinate in the fridge for at least 4 hours.
4. When you are ready to cook thread the chicken cubes onto skewers about 5 pieces per skewer. Remember if you are using wooden skewers to soak them first so they don't burn.
5. Grill under a medium grill until each side is browned. Cut one piece of the chicken in half to ensure it is cooked through. These can also be cooked on the BBQ.,

instructions, 1. 1.Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Discard any tough stems from spinach wash and drain well.  Coarsely chop.
2. 2.Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the spinach and cook until wilted.  Drain well in a colander (set the pan aside) and press with the back of a large spoon to push out excess moister.
3. 3.Melt the butter in the same skillet over medium heat and cook the onions garlic and scallions until wilted stirring often.  When the mixture starts to brown transfer it to a mixing bowl.  Let cool.
4. 4.Add the spinach feta Parmesan chees dill and parsley to the onion mixture.  Beat the egg and yolk together lightly and add to the spinach mixture.  Add very little salt and season with pepper.  Stir in the pine nuts—be careful not to overmix you want the ingredients to remain distinct.
5. 5.Use 1 sheet of phyllo pastry for each 2 spinach triangles.  Brush a smooth work surface (or sheet of plastic wrap) with melted butter.  Spread out 1 sheet of phyllo and brush with butter. (keep the rest of the phyllo covered with a slightly dampened cloth or it will dry out.)  Using a sharp knife cut it lengthwise in half.  Fold eadh rectangle lengthwise in half to make a smaller rectangle.  Place 1½ tablespoons of the spinach mixture in the bottom of one of the rectangles.  Fold one corner of the rectangle over the spinach filling to make a triangle.  Fold this triangle over itself toward the top—as you would fold a flag—and continue folding up until triangle is produced.  Brush this all over with butter and put on the baking sheet.  Continue making triangles until all the spinach filling is used.
6. 6.Bake the triangles for about 20 minutes or until puffed and golden brown.  Serve warm.,

instructions, 1. Olive Mixture:
2. Mix with celery then  totally cover with olive oil cover and put in fridge while you prepare bread or even the day before to save time.
3. Gut bread drizzle and spread olive oil on both sides then lightly sprinkle each side with either a balsamic or red wine vinegar. Spread a thin layer of minced garlic on the bread.end to end( everything you do to one side is done for both sides).
4. Now spread a generous layer about 2 tablespoons of the celery mixture on each side.
5. Now we put the sandwich together -- LOL.
6. I am going to list the meats I buy and the amounts. I buy from the deli and have it sliced sandwich thin.
7. Makeing The Sandwich:
8. Now begin your layers remember duplicate each side.
9. I usually layer 3 different meats then a layer of cheese --  I alternate the 2 cheeses and just sprinkle parmesan at will.
10. Then add a thin layer of the celery mix and start all over making sure to use all the different meats before repeating them fill both sides completely full making sure  they are totally full then add cheese on one layer before putting the 2 sides together. *Make sure you have a piece of heavy duty aluminum foil laid out under the bread that is big enough to completely wrap the entire sandwich.  I slide the 2 sides right next to each other then carefully flip one on top of the other then tightly wrap and seal the entire sandwich and place in frig at least 2 hours --  Overnight is even better but 2 hours will do. Then leaving it wrapped put it in a 350 oven and bake for 45 minutes to an hour has to heat all the way through and let the cheese melt. Carefully unwrap and make sure it is hot all the way through( if needed rewrap and cook a bit longer) Once it is done let it sit 15-20 minutes then  you can cut into sandwich slices( electric knife works best or a good serrated edged bread knife) I like my portions cut into 2 inch slices  remember it is a rich sandwich and larger portions tend to fall apart on you. Best served hot to at least warm and it keeps in frig real well and reheats  fairly well in microwave.
11. Hope this is easy enough to understand. In New Orleans they just use Italian ham and don't gut and stuff the bread like I do but I LOVE mine best -- lol.,

cuisine, European >> Greek >> Greek, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Before starting anything it must be noted that Moussaka in every Greek home is made in 3 'stages'.  The preparation of the meat sauce the vegetable cooking and layering and finally the bechamel cream.
2. FOR THE MEAT SAUCE:
3. Pour the oil into a deep large pan and heat it slightly.  Crumble the minced beef into the oil together with the onion and garlic.  Brown everything well stirring constantly so the beef does not clump.  Pour in the wine and allow everything to boil until the wine evaporates.  Add the fresh tomato oregano bay leaf salt and pepper and stir regularly while waiting for the tomato to soften well.  Pour in the tomato juice stir everything and allow it to cook and thicken.  Finally pour in the water and over a medium flame allow the sauce to cook until the beef is tender and the liquids have evaporated by at least 2/3 and the sauce is thick.
4. WHILE THE MEAT SAUCE IS COOKING PREPARE THE VEGETABLES:
5. Cut the eggplants into medium slices and soak them in salted water for 1 hour before your commence your sauce so everything will be more conveniently timed.  This soaking removes the bitterness in the eggplant skins and also helps them not to absorb so much oil while frying.  Remove the eggplants from the eater strain them well and then dry them on a kitchen towel to absorb any excess water.  Fry the potato slices and then strain them on kitchen paper.  Oil your moussaka plan with the tablespoons of olive oil and created a layer with the fried potatoes taking care not to leave any gaps.  Fry the eggplants and again strain them on kitchen paper and place then in a layer on top of the sliced potatoes.  Sprinkle some salt pepper and 1 tablespoon of the grated cheese on the eggplant layer.
6. Strain the meat sauce of any excess oil (otherwise your moussaka will be too greasy) and then pour it evenly on top of the eggplant.  Sprinkle the sauce with the 2nd tablespoon of grated cheese and then prepare your Bechamel Cream.
7. FOR THE BECHAMEL CREAM:
8. This is an age old recipe handed down from mother to daughter in my family and then finally from my mother down to me.  I strongly recommend that you avoid the temptation to adjust it as the extraordinary delight you will get when you taste it atop of traditional country moussaka will leave an aftertaste that will linger in your memory for days.
9. Melt the butter in a pot over a low flame and add the flour stirring with a wooden spoon until the flour and butter combine to make a roux.  Quickly add the 4 of the cups of milk and keep stirring with a whisk until the mixture becomes almost creamy and when it starts to thicken a lot add the remaining milk and the beaten eggs (after the milk).  Continue stirring until everything has combined evenly and is a thick creamy texture - this may take some effort (if you have lumps use an electric hand mixer in it for a couple of minutes and they will dissolve).  Add the sugar mix it in well the salt pepper cinnamon and cheese and mix everything well until it acquires its creamy texture again.  Allow it to bubble over a low flame for about 1 minute while stirring constantly.  If your cream is too thick add a little more milk or water and stir it in well until it obtains the desired thickness.  If on the other hand your cream is a little too thin let it stand for about 5 minutes and it will thicken as it cools and then use it.
10. Pour the Bechamel cream evenly on top of the meat sauce and add the dabs of margarine to the surface of the cream in various places.  Bake the moussaka in a medium preheated oven at 180ºC - 350ºF for about 30 minutes or until the cream unevenly gently browns in places.  Allow the moussaka to cool for about 20 minutes and then cut it into servings.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Spread walnuts in a single layer on a ungreased cookie sheet and toast for 5-7 minutes.  Stir occasionally to ensure even toasting.  Remove from oven and let cool.
2. In a large bowl combine flour baking powder baking soda cloves. Set aside.
3. In a food processor (or blender) combine the lemon and orange zest with the sugar.  Process for several minutes stopping to scrape down the sides. You want the zest to be chopped very fine and well incorporated into the sugar. Add the walnuts and canola oil and continue processing until the walnuts have been pureed into the sugar.  Transfer to a small bowl.
4. Place the butter into the food processor and mix for a minute until the butter is light and fluffy. Add the sugar zest walnut mixture egg and egg yolk and either brandy or juice. Process just until these ingredients are well mixed into the butter.
5. Gradually add in the flour pulsing quickly after each addition.  Use as little mixing time at this point as over-processing the dough toughens the cookie. Once mixed divide dough into two balls wrap each ball in wax paper and place in fridge for 90 minutes or longer.
6. Preheat (or reheat) oven to 350 degrees. Prepare cookie sheets with a light brush of oil or cooking spray.
7. Take one ball of dough and split in half.  Return half to fridge while working with the other.  With the half you are working with pinch off a ball of dough about the size of a shelled walnut. Quickly roll into a rope about 4 to 6 inches long.  Ropes can be shaped into rings horseshoes or an ‘S.’ Place on cookie sheet 2 inches apart.  If the dough warms and becomes difficult to handle return it to the fridge and continue working with another piece of well-chilled dough.
8. Bake cookies for 10 to 12 minutes until they are browned on the edges and just a little golden on the tops.  Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 2 or 3 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. Once fully cooled dust with powdered sugar.,

cuisine, European >> Greek >> Greek, 
time, ,

instructions, 1. Unpackage and prep a roasting chicken or stew hen (take off the plastic remove the giblets and neck from inside (save for stock) look over the skin and pluck any feathers with a washed pair of needlenose pliers singe off any pinfeathers with a grill lighter drain excess liquid from the cavity).
2. Set it into a small roaster or dutch oven that has a secure lid.
3. Sprinkle half the garlic and half the oregano over the chicken.
4. Put the other half of the seasonings into the cavity.
5. Put half the liquids into the cavity and pour the other half over the bird (you want to wash some but not all the seasonings into the pot).
6. Cover and roast at 300 for 2-3 hours or at 250 for 3 hours. You can remove the lid for the last half hour or so to get better browning.
7. The meat will be very tender -- falling off the bones (a stew hen may have more integrity depending on how tough it started before you tenderized it with the moist heat).
8. Suggestion -- Serve over plain rice pilaf (try Recipe #213303 ) or couscous. For a vegetable I'd go with a mixed green salad with olives and feta in it or a spinach salad. If I needed to use a hot veggie green beans with butter and sesame would be good.,

instructions, 1. Wash lamb pieces well and throw them in a tall pot covering them with cold water.
2. Bring to the boil skimming the pot frequently and then turn the heat down and simmer for 2 hours.
3. Add the spring onion which has been washed and chopped coarsely (around 2cm pieces.)  Add salt and pepper to taste.
4. Simmer for another 20 minutes then add the rice which has been rinsed and boil for another 15 minutes until the rice is cooked.
5. Allow the soup to cool slightly and make an avgolemono or egg-lemon sauce.
6. Separate the eggs and beat the whites for 5 minutes on low speed with a hand-held mixer until white. (It must not be firm or meringue-like.).
7. Add yolks and beat briefly then add the lemon juice in a thin stream until the mixture is fluffy.
8. Then add hot soup in a thin trickle beating all the while at a low speed until most of the broth has been incorporated. You will need a large bowl to do this and you should tilt it at the beginning when you beat the egg whites so they are covered by the beaters.
9. Be careful not to go too quickly or the egg will cook and curdle it must be warmed up gradually.
10. Tip the contents of the bowl back into the pot and mix lightly with a ladle.
11. NOTE: The lamb here in Greece is very fatty so I don't add any oil at all to the soup but if you use leaner types of lamb (e.g. Australian or New Zealand) you may like to add 1/3 cup of oil to the soup.,

22. Note: you can change the proportion of the ingredient on your taste or on what available.
23. Note: if you have bigger zucchini they will contain to much water. Put your sliced or grated zucchini in a bowl; add 1-2 teaspoons of salt. Stir. After 30 minutes rinse and drain prior use. Or perhaps another solution is to spread some breadcrumbs on fillo prior filling it with potatoes and zucchini. If you try this please let me know!,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 450°F  Prepare a brown grocery bag for baking (see Note).
2. Place the squid in the center of the prepared bag.  Top with the tomatoes garlic and mint and then sprinkle the salt over all.  Fold up the bag envelope style to enclose the ingredients.  Place the bag seam side up on a baking sheet.
3. Bake until the bag is puffed out a bit 20 minutes.  Transfer the bag to a platter and ease it open taking care to avoid the escaping steam.  Arrange 12 to 18 small toasts around the squid and serve right away. Serves 6.
4. NOTE:  To prepare a brown bag for baking cut it lengthwise and open it out.  Coat the face-up side (inside) with a thin film of olive oil (about 2 tablespoons for a large grocery bag).  The oil will seep through to the other side and will prevent the bag from crumbling or burning in the oven during baking.
5. PREPARING SQUID:  While already cleaned squid are an excellent time-saver and ounce for ounce a good buy too much of the flavor of the sea is washed away in the commercial cleaning.  I recommend buying whole squid and preparing them yourself.
6. With a paring knife sever the tentacles from the squid body just above the eyes where you feel a hard ball.  With your fingers push out the hard ball from the center of the tentacles and discard the ball.  Gently pull out inside material trying to avoid tearing the bodies.  Rinse the prepared tentacles and bodies in a colander.
7. To cut cleaned squid bodies into rings slice crosswise to the thickness desired.  If the tentacles section is small leave it whole; if large halve it lengthwise through the area where the hard ball was located.
8. If stuffing the whole squid bodies fill the squid close and secure with toothpicks.
9. THYME TOASTS: 1 baguette cut into 1/2 inch thick slices.  Several sprigs fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried. 2  tablespoons olive oil.  Preheat the oven to 450°F.
10. Arrange the bread slices in one layer on a baking sheet and bake until barely golden around the edges 5 minutes.
11. Using the thyme sprigs as a brush rub one side of each toast with oil.  (Or if using dried thyme stir it into the oil and use a pastry brush to rub the toasts.)  Use right away or store in an airtight container for up to 2 days.

instructions, 1. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan and add the onion finely chopped.
2. Allow the onion to soften on a medium heat for about 10 minutes. Slightly caramelise but don't allow to become brown or crispy.
3. Add the minced lamb to the frying pan and turn up the heat a bit. Fry the mixture stirring frequently for about 5 minutes until the lamb is browned. Or you could use quorn in which case omit this step- see step 5.
4. Drain off some of the oil and put the mince and onions into a large saucepan.
5. Add the tin of tomatoes the purees and the spinach. If you are using quorn add at this stage and you'll need a bit more water. Allow to simmer for about 5 minutes until the spinach is defrosted and heated through stirring often (or you can use fresh spinach which may be quicker).
6. Drain and rinse the tin of chickpeas. Add them and the lemon juice to the pot and continue to simmer until they are warmed through and the sauce has thickened to your preferred consistency.
7. Taste and season to your preference. You might like to use a little sugar to balance the sharp flavours but the tomato puree should hopefully have done that already. Serve with hearty bread if you like. My soda bread is perfect! This also tastes great reheated the next day.,

instructions, 1. In a small container stir the yeast into 1/2 cup of warm water then whisk in 1/4 cup of flour to make the sponge. Leave it in a warm place for 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.
2. When sponge is ready in a large mixing bowl whisk together the remaining flour & the salt then make a well in the center.
3. Into the well add the sponge along with 3-4 tablespoons water the oil & sugar gradually incorporating the flour into the other ingredients.
4. Knead for 10-15 minutes or until the dough is smooth & elastic then leave it in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.
5. When ready punch the dough down & divide it into 8 pieces. Lightly flour a working surface AND hands & roll each piece into a sausage shape then let rest 10-15 minutes.
6. After that roll the dough into a longer sausage shape ~ You will probably have to let the rolls rest once more in order to stretch them to the length they need to be 20-25 inches long.
7. During the 15 minutes that the dough is resting for the last time line a large baking sheet with parchment paper then spread the sesame seeds in a large baking dish & have the egg whites ready in a wide shallow bowl.
8. Dip the long rolls into the egg white & then roll them in the sesame seeds. Twist 2 of them together & join the ends to form a ring about 4-5 inches in diameter. Shape the remaining rolls in the same way then let them rise for about half an hour.
9. About half way through this rising preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
10. When ready bake the galettes for 15-20 minutes or until golden & slightly crisp on the outside. Let cool on a wire rack & serve at room temperature the same day OR freeze for later use. Simply reheat before serving any that have been frozen & then defrosted.,

instructions, 1. Soak the chickpeas overnight in a large bowl of water to which a pinch of salt has been added.  Next morning discard the water and rinse the chickpeas under cold running water.
2. Sauté the onions and garlic until they are soft but not browned at all in about 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a pan. Add the chickpeas cover with water and bring to the boil.  Turn down the heat to a simmer and cook for anywhere between 30 and 60 minutes uncovered until the chickpeas are soft and fully cooked.  If necessary keep topping up with boiling water.  (This is the only recipe in the book of those I've read or madewhich is a bit vague about the cooking times in this step.  I can but conclude that chickpeas vary in how long it takes for them to be cooked.  The important thing is to ensure that the chickpeas are throughly cooked.  Cut one open before completing this step.)  Strain off the water and set aside.
3. Preheat the oven to 200C°/400°F/Gas 6.  Place the aubergines whole on an oiled baking sheet and roast them until they are very soft.  When they have cooled down enough to handle remove the skins and mash the flesh in a bowl with a fork.  Season with salt and pepper to taste stir in the cumin and the chickpeas and mix well so that all ingredients are thoroughly combined.

instructions, 1. In a large Dutch Oven heat the olive oil till smoking and in it brown the pieces of lamb (you may have to do this in 2-3 batches) until golden-brown all over.
2. When all the pieces are browned add onion garlic water and wine (you could use just water if you wanted to) salt and pepper to taste and simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until meat is very tender.
3. Add lettuce and dill.  You may have to cram it into the pot but it will reduce to practically nothing.  Put the lid on the Dutch Oven and cook for 8 minutes.  Remove lid stir carefully not to break up meat and cook another 2 minutes.  Turn off heat.
4. In a large heatproof bowl whisk together eggs cornstarch lemon juice and a little salt and pepper to taste (remember there is more in the pot).
5. With a ladle remove ladlefuls of the cooking liquid the meat and lettuce have cooked in and VERY slowly whisk it into the egg/lemon mixture.  Keep doing this until whisking all the while until you have incorporated most of your cooking liquid - this tempers the egg-lemon sauce so it won't curdle when added to your lamb.
6. Pour all the sauce into the pot covering the lamb and lettuce.  Turn heat up to medium-high and just bring to the boil.  Cook for 1-2 minutes.
7. Dinner is ready.  Have lots of crusty bread around to sop up the delicious avgolemono sauce.,

instructions, 1. Making fake feta: Cube tofu into 1" cubes.
2. Submerge in boiling water & simmer for about 5 minutes. Drain.
3. Whisk together water miso vinegar & salt. Add tofu to marinade. Stir gently and refrigerate. Marinate for at least 2 days - up to 1 week. Shake the container periodically.
4. Before using remove marinade from tofu & crumble tofu with fingers. Use within 2 weeks after it's been crumbled. Side note; my 2 year old actually likes this all by itself!
5. From this point it should take about 3 hours:
6. "Sweat" your eggplant slices in a single layer on towels by sprinkling generously with salt (kosher or regular) for 45 min - 1 hour blotting every 15 min or so flip after 30 min and salt other side. Rinse after eggplant has begun looking brown in color. then squeeze with hands to remove as much water as possible finishing with a squeeze from some paper towels. Small batches of squeezing is necessary. Dip dried off eggplant slices in flour to lightly coat both sides. Fry in 1/4" oil until edges are lightly browned on one side + 2 minutes on the flip side. Drain on towel or on cooling rack.
7. While eggplant is sweating preheat oven to 350. Line a baking sheet w/ parchment paper. Spread potatoes evenly and bake for 30 minutes.
8. Also while eggplant is sweating for the "meat" sauce:
9. Add boiling water to the TVP. Add in the worcestershire sauce and gently stir. In a pan saute onion in 1 tsp oil until tender. Add garlic continue to cook for 1-2 minutes over med low heat. Add TVP vinegar tomato sauce oregano parsley salt pepper and cinnamon. Stir.
10. To assemble: Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
11. Grease or oil an 8x8 or 9x9 baking dish that's at least 2" tall.
12. Cover the bottom with 1/2 of the eggplant then 1/2 of the potatoes then 1/2 of the zucchini (uncooked) then all the meat mixture and 1/2 of the fake feta.
13. Finish by layering the rest of the eggplant potatoes zucchini and "feta". Bake for 1 hour.
14. While it's baking prepare the bechamel sauce which you will add to the moussaka and continue to cook until an hour is up:
15. Melt the oil or butter whisk continuously as you add the flour then slowly add the milk. Keep at it until it begins to thicken which will happen all of a sudden. When this happens turn off the heat and add 1/4 C egg beater (optional) and the salt. Whisk again just to mix.
16. At this point it might be 20-30 minutes into cooking. Take out the moussaka and pour the bechamel sauce evenly to coat. Try to fill in any large gaps. If you have extra just pour it on the middle it should spread a little while cooking. Sprinkle lightly with cinnamon. Back into the oven it goes to complete the total of 1 hour cook time. Be sure the bechamel has a little bit of browning before taking it out just for looks.
17. Let sit for 20 minutes before serving.
18. If you want to make ahead prepare dish and just don't make the bechamel sauce until you're ready to stick it in the oven. Same with freezing. No bechamel sauce for the freezer.,

6. Stir ricotta into mixture.
7. Taste the mixture and season with salt and pepper to taste. The feta cheese is salty so be careful not to over-salt.
8. Allow the mixture to cool slightly. Pour beaten eggs over mixture and stir.
9. Unroll phyllo dough. Cover with a damp paper towel to keep it from drying out.
10. Generously spray a 11x13 baking dish (glass or metal will work) with olive oil spray.
11. Place one sheet of phyllo in the bottom of the dish. Spray the sheet with olive oil spray. Continue layering the phyllo spraying each sheet well with olive oil until you've built about 10 layers.
12. Spoon half of the spinach filling over the layered phyllo dough.
13. Place two or three sheets of phyllo over the spinach mixture. Do not spray these layers. They are just to absorb some moisture from the filling.
14. Spoon the rest of the spinach mixture evenly over the phyllo.
15. Layer 10 more sheets of phyllo over the spinach spraying each layer.
16. Score the upper layer of phyllo into 9 square pieces with a sharp knife. Cut all the way through the top ten sheets but be careful not to cut the bottom ones. This makes it easy to cut and serve when it's done. If you want larger servings cut it into 6 pieces.
17. Bake in the oven for 45 minutes or until phyllo dough is golden.
18. Allow to cool for at least 10 minutes then cut and serve. Spanakopita is traditionally served just warm or even cold but I enjoy this when it is still hot.
19. Enjoy!,

2. Add all the remaining ingredients except for the bell pepper and the kidney beans bring to a boil and then lower the heat to a simmer (slightly bubbling).
3. Cover and allow the chili to simmer for three hours stirring often.
4. At the end of three hours remove the garlic clove and the bay leaves and drop in the red bell pepper (or substitute a jalapena pepper if you prefer just a litle heat).
5. Simmer for two more hours again stirring often.
6. At the end of the two hours remove the whole pepper and add the drained/rinsed kidney beans. Simmer for one additional hour covered and continue frequent stirring.
7. Tips: If you see a need to add just a little additional chicken stock along the way go ahead and do so remembering that you will be topping spaghetti and/or hot dogs with this chili. Also this is a very old recipe (1922) and any "tweaking" will probably not serve to improve it. Finally make sure that your spices are fresh -- I prefer ancho chili powder but any variety will do.
8. Condiments for the spaghetti dish version include diced sweet onion sharp cheddar cheese and Tabasco sauce. Servings are based on spaghetti not hot dogs.,

2. Core the cleaned apples and cut in 1/2-inch rings.
3. Measure out the cider.
4. Preheat two frying pans on low heat. Turn the heat up under one of the frying pans to medium-high and add 4 ounces of butter.
5. As soon as the butter stops frothing and starts to turn a pale brown add the pork chops and brown well on both sides.
6. Start the next step while the pork chops are browning. While the pork chops are browning use the remaining 2 ounces of butter for the apples.
7. Add the butter to the second preheated frying pan and turn the heat up to medium. As soon as the butter stops frothing sauté the apple rings until golden brown.
8. They will brown very quickly. Use a spatula to turn.
9. As soon as the pork chops are browned - about 2 1/2 minutes per side - while the apples are still being sautéd add the cider to the meat and reduce heat to low.
10. It is unlikely that all the apple rings will fit in the frying pan at the same time so divide the butter appropriately. Have a plate ready to hold the cooked apples until all the rings are done.
11. Using a spatula carefully place the apple rings on top of the pork chops. Simmer together for 5 minutes.
12. Serve on a platter or individual plates spooned over with sauce. Add a sprinkle of cinnamon and serve.,

instructions, 1. Start by preparing the potatoes.  This can be done well in advance.  Bring a large pot of water to the boil.  Add the potatoes whole and unpeeled and boil uncovered for 25 minutes or until very soft.  Remove potatoes from the water to a plate until needed.  It doesn't matter if they get cold.
2. Now divide each bunch of herbs roughly into four:  one quarter to go between the skin and the breast; one quarter to go in the cavity; one quarter to scatter over the chicken; and one quarter reserved for garnish.  Strip the leaves from one quarter of the oregano and one quarter of the thyme discarding any woody stalks.  Leave the remaining herbs intact.
3. Now wash the cavity of the chicken with cold running water and dry the chicken very well inside and out with paper towels.  Using a pair of kitchen shears or a sharp pair of scissors trim the wing tips from the chicken as these will burn at the high temperature you're going to cook at.
4. Preheat your oven to 240C or 230C fan-forced and make sure there's a rack in the centre or just below the centre and plenty of room above for the chicken.
5. Place the chicken on a plate and carefully working from the neck end slip your finger between the skin and the flesh on the right breast of the chicken breaking through the membrane and separating the skin from the flesh being careful not to pierce the skin with your fingernail.  Try to wriggle your finger down near the drumstick and separate some of the skin from it too.  Repeat for the left breast.
6. In a bowl roughly mix together the butter cubes the herb leaves you've stripped from their stalks and the chopped peeled garlic.
7. Using your fingers push this mixture carefully into the pockets you've formed between the skin and the flesh of the chicken breasts and if possible a little way down towards the drumsticks.  It doesn't matter if a bit falls out you can just shove that into the cavity later.
8. Put the chopped unpeeled garlic and one 'one-quarter' bunch each of the oregano and thyme into the cavity of the chicken. You should now have two bunches each of the oregano and thyme left and one bulb of unpeeled garlic cloves.
9. If using a large lemon cut in half and squeeze the juice from one half only.  If using two small lemons squeeze one whole lemon.  Drizzle the lemon juice over the top of the chicken and place the squeezed portion/s of the lemon into the cavity.
10. Thinly slice the unsqueezed large lemon half or whole small lemon and set slices aside.
11. Line a large baking pan with silicone (baking) paper.  (Be sure to use a pan that will withstand a high heat.  Non-stick pans are probably not suitable for this as you may ruin the coating.)  Lining the pan is optional but it makes washing up a lot easier and stops stuff from sticking.
12. Place the sliced onion in the base of the pan and place the chicken on top.
13. Now arrange the lemon slices over the top of the chicken and scatter the unpeeled garlic cloves over the top being sure to tuck some of the garlic and the lemon slices down between the breast and the leg.
14. Sprinkle generously with sea salt and cracked black pepper.
15. Now take the potatoes you cooked earlier and using a potato masher push down on each one gently until the skin splits and the potato inside breaks up a bit.  Don't worry if they fall apart a little bit.  It's supposed to look rustic!  They should look squashed but not flattened.
16. Now arrange the potatoes around the chicken in the baking pan and sprinkle them with salt and pepper then drizzle the potatoes and the chicken generously with olive oil.  By all means use extra virgin olive oil if you like it but it's not essential ordinary olive oil will do.
17. Finally scatter the remaining herbs over the chicken and the potatoes.

2. In food processor or blender add cucumbers garlic lemon juice dill and/or mint and a few grinds of black pepper. Process until well blended then stir into yogurt. Taste before adding any extra salt then salt if needed. Place in refrigerator for at least two hours before serving so flavors can blend.
3. This will keep for a few days in the refrigerator but you will need to drain off any water and stir each time you use it.
4. ** If you can’t find the thicker Greek Yogurt Cheese you can use regular plain yogurt that is either full fat or low fat. To thicken spoon yogurt into cheese cloth that has been quadrupled. Draw the corners of the cloth up and tie together. Suspend above a bowl for 2 hours so that water can drip out. The consistency of the yogurt should be like that of sour cream.
5. You can skip this draining process if you want but you will have a moderately messier runnier result.,

cuisine, European >> Greek >> Greek, 
time, ,

instructions, 1. In a large saucepan over medium heat sauté eggplant and onion stirring occasionally until eggplant is soft and has become almost a puree about 20 minutes.
2. Add bacon or ham tomato paste and salt and pepper (careful with the salt - it may not seem like a lot but the bacon and the cheese that will be added later will add a lot more) and cook another 5 minutes.  You may have a dark brown film on the bottom of your skillet (I do not use non-stick surfaces - only stainless steel).  You will find that this scrapes up easily once you turn off the heat and the eggplant puree starts to cool.  Do scrape it back into the puree with a spoon as this is highly-flavoured and helps the overall taste (if it doesn't scrape easily in the beginning just wait a couple of minutes longer).  Allow to cool.
3. Note:  The eggplant puree can be made up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated.  Bring to room temperature before continuing with recipe.
4. In a large bowl combine well eggplant puree feta eggs parsley and mint.  Taste a small amount of the filling to decide if you would like it a bit saltier.
5. Preheat oven to 390°F.
6. Butter bottom and sides of a 15 X 11 inch baking pan.  Stagger sheets of phyllo in pan brushing each sheet with olive oil as you position it in the pan.
7. When you have used half the sheets of phyllo pastry empty the filling into the pan and spread it out evenly.
8. Continue staggering the remaining sheets of phyllo over top brushing each one with olive oil as you position it in the pan.  Tuck in any overhang you have and give a last generous brushing of olive oil to the whole pie.
9. With a sharp knife score the pie lengthwise into 4 strips and then score into 4 strips crosswise (resulting in 16 pieces of pie).  DO NOT CUT ALL THE WAY THROUGH PHYLLO - JUST THE TOP LAYERS.
10. Generously sprinkle the pie with some tap water using your fingertips (run your hand under the tap and sprinkle the water over the pie - do about 5 of these sprinkles - this results in a crisper crunchier crust).
11. Brush pie with egg wash and sprinkle with the sesame seeds.  Bake for 1 hour or until pie is a golden-brown.  You may need to reverse pan back to front midway through baking.
12. Allow to cool 15-20 minutes before cutting into.  Personally I like this pie just warm or at room temperature.

instructions, 1. NOTE: DO NOT SUBSTITUTE Recipe #488671 WITH ANY OTHER SEASONING! PREPARE THE BREADING EXACTLY AS WRITTEN (STEP 1): RINSE and blot chicken; CUT chicken into 8 pieces (or 10 pieces with breast portions cut in half).
2. POUR 7 3/4 cups cold water into a large wide saucepan (with an accompanying lid) then add 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons fine sea salt and slices of 1 thinly sliced lemon; STIR to mix well; ADD chicken pieces; COVER and transfer to refrigerator; MARINATE chicken between 4-36 hours in refrigerator turning chicken as needed (marinate 36 hours for the most tender flavorful chicken). NOTE: FOR A QUICKER STOVETOP MARINATION METHOD PIERCE CHICKEN PIECES WELL WITH A FORK THEN HEAT THE MARINADE WITH CHICKEN COVERED OVER LOW HEAT FOR 20-30 MINUTES (TURN CHICKEN ONCE MIDWAY THROUGH).
3. MEASURE the BREADING ingredients into a large sealable container such as a GLAD food storage container or a Ziploc bag: 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon fine sea salt and 1 tablespoon Recipe #488671; SEAL the container with mixture; SHAKE well until thoroughly combined.
4. REMOVE chicken from marinade with tongs; PLACE one piece chicken at a time into the breading mixture container; SEAL container firmly; SHAKE chicken gently in all motions to thoroughly coat chicken until evenly and generously breaded; PLACE breaded chicken piece onto a rack to rest; REPEAT with remaining pieces chicken; ALLOW breaded chicken to absorb the breading for a few minutes before frying.
5. ADD the manufacturer's recommended amount frying oil for deep-frying; PLACE deep-fryer basket into place in deep-fryer; PREHEAT fryer to 315°F (or preheat enough fat to immerse chicken completely in deep heavy stovetop pot between 315°F to 325°F using a standard deep-fryer thermometer to gauge).
6. CAREFULLY drop each piece breaded chicken one at a time gently into the deep-fryer basket without crowding (if a standard size home fryer is used add no more than 2-3 pieces at a time); (if stovetop frying gently place breaded chicken pieces into hot oil using tongs turning once halfway through frying duration).
7. FRY chicken between 16-20 minutes until golden brown and fully cooked depending on chicken portions/sizes (juices should run clear when chicken is done); FOR SOFT BREADING: Place cooked drained chicken into a large Ziploc bag to steam (the steam will soften the breading). Before serving reheat chicken if needed in sealed Ziploc bag in a microwave oven using the same setting for reheating 1-2 frozen pastries (just before bag will begin to swell from heat and steam). FOR CRISPY BREADING: Place chicken on wire rack over baking sheet. Transfer into a preheated 170°F oven until all chicken has been fried.
8. MAINTAIN frying fat temperature for remaining chicken; REPEAT the same cooking/steaming or warming procedures for the remaining chicken.
9. SERVE with lemon wedges if desired for a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.
10. ENJOY!,

instructions, 1. Cut the eggplant lengthways into thin strips finely chop the chicken (I find it easier to cut the chicken with kitchen scissors) peel and finely chop the onion and garlic.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a pan preferably non-stick and sauté the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes or until soft; add the chicken and sauté until browned and cooked through.
3. Transfer to a bowl season to taste and allow to cool slightly.  Stir in the basil lemon zest and cheese.
4. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in the cleaned pan add the eggplant slices in batches and sauté for 3-4 minutes turning until browned.  Remove and keep warm on a plate covered with foil.  Repeat the process with the remaining oil and eggplant slices until all of them have been browned.
5. Lay the eggplant slices on a work surface and spread with the chicken mixture (do not overfill the eggplant slice or the mixture will ooze out the sides when you roll it) and roll (Swiss-roll style) to enclose the roll and secure it with a cocktail stick so that the stick is flat and woven once through the eggplant slice where it closes.
6. Add the sauce to the cleaned pan and heat until simmering add the rolls cover and simmer for 5 minutes or until they are heated through.
7. Transfer to a warmed serving plate.  You may like to remove the cocktail sticks at this stage.  Garnish with basil and serve.
8. Chef's note:  I rarely salt eggplant before using it and haven't found it to be necessary in this recipe; but if you prefer to do so add in that step.  If you have any slices of eggplant left over once you have made your rolls chop them roughly and add them to the sauce in step 6.  If you have filling left over use it to stuff another vegetable: a tomato or mushroom would be ideal.  Refrigerate until you have time to deal with it!
9. Vegetarian Variation: For a vegetarian version replace the chicken with 350g (12 ounces) of fresh spinach.  Washdry and finely shred the spinach then add to the pan in step 2 with the onion and heat until wilted.  Or for a quicker version of this use a thawed and thoroughly squeeze-dried packet of frozen spinach.  And add a pinch of nutmeg cumin or cinnamon.,

2. Drizzle the garlic infused oil over the mix until it looks juicy and perfect for dipping your bread into.
3. Spray a skillet with olive oil baking spray or pour enough olive oil in the skillet to just coat the bottom.  Heat over medium-high heat.  Warm your pita bread in the skillet.  Remove and cut into quarters.  Repeat with the other piece of pita bread.  (When desperate I've seen this eaten with yeast rolls. lol).
4. Serve the bread warm from the skillet with the feta cheese mix. The feta cheese/olive mix should be at room temperature or just slightly warmer.  You don't want the olive oil congealed so if made ahead of time zap it at 50% in the microwave to knock the chill off of it. It's almost like Greek crostini!,

3. Wash eggplants and potatoes (peel). Cut lengthwise down the middle then into ½ inch slices.
4. Sprinkle salt on both sides of the eggplant and potato slices.
5. Coat 2 baking trays with olive oil (one for each vegetable because potatoes will cook faster than the eggplant).
6. Use paper towels to pat the salt absorbed moisture from the eggplant and potato slices (I suggest leaving a little moisture on the potatoes because they tend to dry out).
7. Coat eggplant and potato slices with olive oil and place in oven until browned (light to medium). Flip and repeat.
8. Coat a non-stick 9 x13-inch baking dish with olive oil.
9. Cover the bottom with your eggplant slices (potatoes will be used later).

16. Very important: taste after mixing and adjust ingredients accordingly (some people might like a little more of a kick).
17. Heavy Construction:
18. Pour enough beef mixture to cover eggplant.
19. Layer with the potato slices.
20. Cover with beef.
21. Layer with eggplant slices.
22. Make all the layers you can! Have fun with it but remember to leave enough room for the cream sauce!  Set aside.

26. Remove from heat and slowly stir in milk.
27. Return to heat until slightly thickened.
28. In a small bowl beat the eggs and additional yolk.

instructions, 1. Mix together the yeast sugar 1/2 cup of the barley flour and the warm water in a large bowl.  Cover with a cloth and set aside in a warm place until bubbly 30 minutes.
2. Add the 1/4 cup oil remaining 3 cups barley flour the salt and the 1/2 cup water.  Stir until you can gather the mixture into a sticky ball.
3. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic about 5 minutes.
4. Coat the dough with oil transfer to a bowl cover with a cloth and set it aside in a warm place until a bit spongy but not nearly doubled 2 hours.
5. Divide the dough into 12 pieces.  With your hands press each piece out to form a flat oval about 12 inches long 6 1/2 inches wide and 1/4 inch thick.  Fold in the long sides of each oval so that they overlap forming a roll.  Then pull the roll around with the side seam on the inside to form a ring.  Squeeze the ends together and press any cracks closed.
6. Place the rings on an ungreased baking sheet.  Cover with a cloth and let rest until a little spongy again 30 minutes.
7. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
8. Brush the rings with water and bake until beginning to brown 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow them to cool completely on the baking sheet.
9. When the rings have cooled preheat the oven to 200°F.
10. Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the rings until dry all the way through 7 hours (overnight is fine).  Store in an airtight container for up to 1 year.  To use soak the rings briefly in water coffee tea or other liquid until just soft about 5 minutes.
11. NOTE:  If stone ground barley flour is hard to find or time is short commercially made barley rings can be purchased at any Greek specialty grocery store.
12. In Greece barley rings are made of just plain barley flour.  Their height may be helped by the fact that the rings are folded over but also the barley flour in Greece is different from that found in the United States; it is quite fibrous.  Because of the flour differences the barley rings in this recipe though delicious are lighter in color and shorter in stature than the native ones.

instructions, 1. Make sure the squid bodies gave been thoroughly gutted. Rinse them pat dry and set aside. Place the chopped tentacles in a dish and set them aside.
2. Prepare the stuffing: Briefly heat the olive oil in a medium-sized skillet add the onion and garlic and saute the vegetables 1 minute. Add the chopped tentacles and saute 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat add all the remaining stuffing ingredients EXCEPT the squid bodies stirring to combine thoroughly.
3. Stuff the squid: With your fingers or a very narrow small spoon (like a demitasse spoon) place about 2 1/2 tablespoons of the stuffing into each body leaving some room in the cavity to allow for shrinkage as the squid cooks. After the stuff has been divided into the squid bodies secure the opening of each by weaving a toothpick through it horizontally.
4. Prepare the braising sauce: Use a skillet or braising pan with a tight fitting lid that is just large enough to hold all the squid in a single layer. Briefly heat the olive oil add the onion and garlic and saute for 1-2 minutes until the onion is just soft. Add the remaining sauce ingredients and bring to a simmer.
5. Braise the squid:
6. Add the stuffed squid to the sauce in a single layer. Bring to a simmer then turn the heat to low and cover the pan tightly. Gently simmer for 50 minutes to 1 hour (the longer time for larger squid) checking after about 40 minutes to be sure the liquid has not evaporated and adding some wine or water if needed. Serve the squid hot with some of the sauce spooned over them.,

instructions, 1. FILLING -- Boil frozen chopped spinach about 15 minutes. Strain in a fine mesh colander and douse with plenty of cold water.  Grab handfuls and squeeze as much water as you can from them and make into golfball sized balls. Put these all into some cheesecloth and squeeze the remaining water -- this takes some wrist strength -- when no more water will come out you happy!
2. Place the strained spinach into a large bowl add eggs cream cheese onion and garlic.  Add dry spices and use your hands to mix all of this up.
3. Mix in feta gently but thoroughly -- try to leave some small chunks of feta.
4. Refrigerate if you are not going right into assembly but remove 15 minutes before you begin assembly.
5. ASSEMBLY -- this takes about one full hour -- Combine and warm the butter & olive oil in a small pot turn off burner.
6. Working on a flat surface brush one strip of phyllo with the oil/butter mixture only on one side.
7. At one end spoon a tablespoon of filling and flatten it so that it looks triangular and even along 2 of the outer edges.
8. Fold over to create your first triangle layer -- lightly brush with oil/butter and continue to fold the triangle and brush until you reach the end of the pastry (5-6 folds).
9. Seal the edge and brush the entire triangle lightly with oil/butter.
10. Place on cookie sheet -- when you have filled the cookie sheet cover with waxed paper and continue placing the triangles on top -- they will not stick together that way.  Repeat until you have run out of pastry or filling whichever comes first -- the leftover filling is great on pizza or baked pasta.
11. BAKING -- Bake in bunches seam side down on ungreased cookie sheet at 375 F for about 15 minutes (watch closely for last few minutes). Do not underbake -- all of the phyllo should be golden and crisp.  Cool on a rack.
12. FREEZING -- If not baking right away flash freeze for about 1 hour then wrap individual triangles in wax paper place in freezer bags. When baking from frozen increase baking time to about 20 minutes and watch closely for last 5 minutes.,

instructions, 1. Place zucchini herbs peppers onions and 1/4 cup dressing in a medium size bowl. Gently mix (I do this with my hands) to coat all vegetables with dressing. Refrigerate until ready to serve - this step can be done several hours ahead.
2. Just before serving time remove zucchini/veggie combination from refrigerator and transfer to serving platter or bowl. Sprinkle with peas tomatoes and olives and drizzle with more dressing to taste. Finish salad off by sprinkling with the Feta and pine nuts if desired. Serve slightly cool or at room temperature.
3. If serving as a dinner salad - Just before serving slice chicken sausage into 1/4 inch slices slice slightly on the diagonal. Heat a medium saute pan over medium high heat add 2 teaspoons olive oil and swirl pan to coat bottom completely. Add sliced sausage and cook 1-2 minutes or until golden then flip and repeat on other side. Remove from heat and add to salad.
4. Serves 6-8 as a side salad or 4 as a dinner salad.
5. Notes:
6. *To slice zucchini first make sure your vegetable peeler is fairly sharp - the first time I tried this it was a pain (and a mess)! I realized that my vegetable peeler was quite old and dull. I purchased a new one and the slicing was a breeze; cut stem and base ends off of zucchini and place on a flat surface. Slice a thin strip off of one long edge and turn zucchini over so cut surface is now on the bottom. This gives you a flat surface so the zucchini won't roll. Using a vegetable peeler cut thin strips or ribbons of zucchini. Slice 3 or 4 strips on the first side then rotate back to other side and continue slicing until you get to the seedy middle and what's left is too thin to slice anymore. Discard the core.
7. **If you haven't tried chicken sausage you're missing out on a wonderful secret. Chicken sausages come in all kinds of flavor combinations you need to try a few and find your favorites. There are several things I love about these sausages - they are low fat most of the time between 3-5 grams of saturated fat and 110-160 calories per sausage. They usually have a ton of protein anywhere from 12-18 grams! That means they keep you satiated for a long time! They are also just plain delicious and can be grilled sautéed used in pizzas panninis sandwiches quiches etc. etc. I always have some of these in my freezer. Currently my favorite is the Three Cheese variety from Sam's Club (15 gm. of protein with only 130 calories).,

instructions, 1. Place the flour cocoa sugar salt and pepper into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse to combine. Add the cold butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse oatmeal. Add the egg yolk and ice water and pulse just until a crumbly dough starts to form – do not overwork or your crusts will be tough.
2. Form the dough into a disk wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes or up to 3 days. The dough freezes for 1 month if wrapped well and sealed in a freezer-safe bag.
3. When ready to continue preheat the oven to 350 F and brush a baking sheet with melted butter.
4. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and allow to sit for 10 minutes – just to come up to a workable temperature. Scatter a clean work surface with a small amount of flour and roll the dough out to about 1/8 to ¼ inch thick. Remember that the less the dough is worked and heated the more tender it will be. So work quickly and use your fingertips rather than the palms of your hands.
5. Using a 3 ½ or 4 inch round cookie cutter (fluted if possible) cut out circles of dough and transfer to the baking sheet. Roll out the dough scraps again and cut out more circles. Continue until you’ve used up the dough.
6. Prick the dough circles all over with a fork and bake for 8 minutes. Rotate the pan and bake for another 4 to 8 minutes until the crusts are dry and firm. Place the baking sheet on a rack to cool.
7. In a medium bowl stir the mascarpone cheese until creamy. With a sharp knife split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds. Add them to the mascarpone with the Marsala wine and stir until well combined.
8. Just before serving divide the mascarpone cheese between the tart crusts and swirl out with the back of a spoon. Arrange the fig slices (about 9 - 11 for each tartlet) with their tops pointing in to the center of the circle (see photo above) and sprinkle each one with a few strips of orange zest. Serve immediately.,

2. Combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl or baking dish large enough to accommodate the lamb and mix well. Message marinade into lamb making sure it is in everywhere. Cover and refrigerate overnight turning often.
3. Remove from refrigerator to allow it to reach room temperature about 30 minutes.
4. Preheat grill.
5. Re-roll leg into a roast very tightly and tie.
6. Place lamb on middle of the rotisserie skewer making sure it is balanced and secure.
7. Reduce temperature to low. Cook for 2 hours brushing with remaining marinade every 1/2 hour.
8. When the middle of the meat reaches a temperature of about 145 degrees remove from grill.
9. Let a leg of lamb rest for 20 minutes before you start carving it up. This will even out the temperature make sure it’s completely done and allow the juices to flow back into the meat.
10. Carve the meat starting from the thick end and work our way down to the shank.
11. Alternate cooking Method:
12. Start by grilling the leg over a medium high direct heat to sear the surface. This will give the meat a crusty surface and add texture. Turn every 5 minutes to sear the surface evenly. On the rotisserie you won’t have to worry about this. Grill over this direct heat for about 15 minutes then move to indirect grilling and cut the temperature down to a medium heat. Watch for flare-ups during the direct grilling phase. The leg of lamb will need about 20 minutes per pound to cook so plan accordingly.,

3. Heat the oil and saute the onion and garlic until the onions are translucent.

Or you can spread the dough out in a cookie sheet.  Just make sure you leave a good "lip" for the edge of the crust.
8. Using a spatula spread the spinach-ricotta mixture over the dough in an even layer.

8. There will still be plenty of juices in the pan but these will be absorbed by the beans and thicken as the beans cool.
9. Like nearly all bean recipes these only improve the next day and the day after next.
10. In Greece these beans would constitute the main 'vegetarian' meal and would not include the bacon which is my own addition.  We often eat meatless especially when we're fasting.  With or without the bacon or sausage this is good eating especially with a big chunk of sharp feta cheese on the side to nibble on between bites of beans and slurps of sauce and some good honest crusty bread to clean your plate up with. :-).,

instructions, 1. To make the rhubarb sauce clean the rhubarb stalks by pulling off the heavy filaments much as you would pull strings from celery.
2. Cut crosswise into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Place the pieces in a saucepan and add the water. Bring to a boil over high heat reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered until the rhubarb has melted into a puree and is tender 8-10 minutes.
3. Warm the olive oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Add the tomatoes and cook stirring occasionally until the tomatoes are reduced to a thick sauce about 15 minutes.  If using canned tomatoes (I did) skip this step and proceed to 4.
4. Add the wine 1 tablespoon honey and the lemon juice and zest if using and stir well. Add the tomatoes to the rhubarb puree or vice versa and mix well.  NOTE:  I used 2 tablespoons of honey and omitted the lemon juice and zest.
5. Simmer uncovered over low heat until the sauce is thick and rich about 20 minutes. Season with salt pepper and the cinnamon if using. Taste and adjust the sweet-and-sour balance adding a bit more honey if needed. Keep warm.
6. While the sauce is cooking preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Arrange the fish fillets in a single layer in a baking dish. Spoon some of the sauce over them covering them completely. Cover and bake until the fish tests done when the point of a knife is inserted into the thickest part about 15 minutes.
7. Transfer the fillets to a platter and spoon the rest of the warm sauce over them. Serve at once.  I recommend a side of pasta brown rice or gnocchi to soak up the extra sauce!,

2. Sift together the flour baking powder salt and cinnamon.
3. Pour the tahini into a large mixing bowl and slowly drizzle in the orange juice while beating with an electric beater. Add the sugar and beat well for several minutes until this mixture is smooth and lighter in color.
4. Add the dry ingredients and continue mixing with the beaters. The dough will be thick like cookie dough so you'll have to stop and clean the beaters out when they get bogged down! Be patient it IS worth it. :-D When it's well mixed knead in the raisins and walnuts if using- they ARE tasty!
5. Press the dough into the prepared pan using a spatula or slightly moistened fingers to press the dough into place and smooth out the top.
6. Bake for 35 to 38 minutes until light golden brown on top- be sure it's baked through but careful not to let it dry out. Let the cake rest in the pan for several minutes then remove from the pan and cool on a wire rack.
7. You have three options: eat the cake just like this (YUMMM) dust it lightly with powdered sugar or as Jennifer says you can "be really Greek about it" and make a sugar syrup: Boil the sugar and water together in a small saucepan for about 10 minutes to form a slightly thick syrup. Drizzle the syrup liberally over the top of the cake and brush on the sides.
8. Whichever way you decide cut this edible Greek glory into squares or wedges and enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Sauce  --  Mix the feta yogurt half and half salt and pepper and lemon juice. Set to the side in a small bowl and refrigerate.  Done!
2. Couscous  --  As I said takes literally 5 minutes to boil stir in couscous and it's done.  Don't worry about that until the dinner is done.  Although you can put a pot on the stove with the broth lemon juice olive oil salt and pepper and put the couscous in a measuring cup on the side just so it is all ready.
3. Cucumber and Lemon  --  Now I use a English (or seedless cucumber and just dice it up and set to the side (it's done).  Same with slicing the lemon.  One less thing to do at the end of the meal.
4. Meatballs  --  Simply in a large bowl add the feta milk parsley scallions egg oregano salt and pepper.  I mix everything well and then add the meat last. You don't want to over mix the meat as it can make it tough.  Just mix enough to be combined.  Roll into golf ball size meatballs.
5. Saute  --  Just heat up the olive oil in a large saute pan on medium high and cook them until golden brown.  Remove to a plate while you make the sauce.
6. Sauce  --  In the same pan with the drippings from the meatballs add the olives garlic and red pepper and cook just a minute.  then stir in the tomatoes oregano and parsley and cook just another minute to heat up.  Add the meatballs back in to finish cooking.  They will take approximately 5-10 minutes depending on the size. Just keep them on a low simmer.
7. Couscous  --  As the meatballs finish cook the couscous.  Just bring the broth lemon olive oil and seasoning up to a boil. Add the couscous stir and remove from the heat and cover. Use foil a lid saran wrap a plate or anything you have will work just fine. Just let it set for 5 minutes and it is done.
8. Serve  --   Use a fork to fluff the couscous and then just spoon some on your plate. Top with 2-3 of the meatballs and some of the tomato and olive sauce and now the good part. Finish with a spoon of the yogurt sauce over the meatballs and some diced cucumber and then squeeze the lemon.
9. And trust me  --  now you have a totally amazing dish.,

instructions, 1. in a a non-reactive pot on med-high bring milk up to just below boiling while stirring gently but constantly. you'll see a bit of foam starting to form.
2. add the vinegar and stir gently. if the milk doesn't curdle and separate cleanly right away then let it heat a few min longer or add a touch more vinegar a tsp at a time.
3. drain in a strainer lined with several layers of cheesecloth or an old pillowslip that has been bleached and rinsed very well. that liquid you're pouring off is whey btw and useful. you might want to catch it in a big bowl.
4. move your cheese to a mixing bowl and stir in salt to taste. add heavy cream to make it smoother if desired.
5. you can press into mini quiche dishes (line with more cheesecloth so you can un-mold cleanly) and refrigerate overnight to solidify if desired. you can also form into a log and roll it in herbs or marinate it in flavored olive oil. be sure to wrap tightly before storing for up to two weeks but i doubt it will last that long! the whey can be used for baking or boiling in place of water to add some extra protein and vitamins. you can also give it to your pets or water your plants or lots of other things. make a protein shake with some fruit perhaps. happy cheese making!,

cuisine, European >> Greek >> Greek, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Begin by making sure that all your utensils pots and supplies are very clean.  Put the milk into a pot over medium heat.  Heat it to a low boil but keep careful that it doesn't scorch.  Cook it for about 5 minutes then set it aside to cool down until 'warm to the touch'.  Dilute the Pitia in the water and stir it into the warm milk.  Stir in the salt and cover the pot with a clean cloth towel and set it aside to thicken and curdle in a warm place.  This can take anywhere from 6 to 12 hours.
2. Pour the thickened milk into a basket or strainer that has been lined with cheese cloth or fine tulle/netting.  Cover the basket with another piece of net to keep the insects off and hang it over a sink or outside so it can drain thoroughly. Check on the draining cheese.  If it seems that the chunks of curd are too big you can slice through them with a knife to break them up so more of the water will drain out.   It takes about a full day for the cheese to drain to 'Feta' consistency but if you prefer a harder dryer cheese you can let it drain longer. You can also weight down the draining cheese with a dish and a heavy rock placed over it to aid in squeezing out more water and will also give you a thicker cheese.
3. Make the Brine:  You will need enough brine to cover the cheese completely so put an adequate amount of water into a pot and bring it to a boil.  Boil it for 5 minutes then remove it from the heat.  Add some salt to the water.  You will be using the egg as a gauge for the salinity of your brine.  Float the egg in the brine.  Some of the shell should float above water level if not remove the egg and add more salt to the brine.  Put the egg back in to test it again.  You want 1-2cm of shell to be exposed at the water level.  The more shell that floats the saltier the brine. Keep floating / adding salt until you get the salinity that you want.  Cover the brine and set it aside to cool down completely.
4. Invert the basket with the drained cheese onto a clean work surface and remove the cheese cloth.  Cut the cheese into large blocks and put them into a clean and sterile container.  Pour the cooled brine over the cheese.  Keep in mind that Feta has to be completely submerged in the brine or else it will go bad.  Use an inverted plate with a heavy rock placed on it to keep the Feta under the brine level.,

cuisine, European >> Greek >> Greek, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 350°F Oil a 13- by 9-inch heavy metal ceramic or glass baking dish and set aside.
2. Put the rice and 1 tablespoon of the salt in a medium saucepan cover with cold water by 2 inches and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook approximately 30 minutes until the rice is still a little chewy. Drain and reserve.
3. While the rice is cooking put the olive oil in a medium heavy-based saucepan and set over medium heat. Add the onion and gently sauté until translucent 5 to 7 minutes. Cut a good slice off the tomatoes at the stalk end for the lid and shave a little slice off the base so the tomatoes stand straight; set each top next to its tomato.
4. Use a teaspoon to scoop the pulp out into a small bowl chop the pulp and add it to the onions along with the accumulated tomato juices and the remaining teaspoon salt the garlic oregano and pepper. Cook briskly for 5 minutes.
5. Add the rice and stir for 3 minutes or until most of the liquid is absorbed; set aside to cool. Stir in the pine nuts then fill the tomatoes (making sure not to pack down too tightly) piling the mixture over the rim. Press each tomato lid down on top and place the stuffed tomatoes 1 inch apart in the baking dish. If there is any extra rice mixture spoon it around the tomatoes. The dish can be brought to this point the day before covered and refrigerated. When you're ready to bake the tomatoes drizzle with a little extra olive oil and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour depending on the size of the tomatoes adding 10 minutes if they are cold from the fridge.
6. These look most authentic if the tomato skin is slightly blackened on the top. If necessary turn the oven up to 450°F for the last 5 to 10 minutes. The good news is that these tomatoes are just as katapliktiko (unspeakably fabulous) warm or at room temperature so you could bake them earlier in the day if you need space in the oven. Cover with plastic wrap while the tomatoes are still just a little warm. The condensation that forms will keep them from drying out.,

3. Put the onions into a pan preferably non-stick with 50ml of the olive oil and the sugar.  Cook very slowly for about 1 hour until the onions are completely soft and the mixture is the consistency of a light jam.
4. Spread one third of the mixture over the base of an oiled casserole dish (it needs to be a casserole dish with a lid as you'll need to use the lid later) then add a layer of chopped tomatoes and set aside.
5. Add the remaining tomatoes to the fried onions in the pan; and add the nutmeg and half of the parsley; mix well and cook for 10 minutes.
6. Add the water to the pan contents and stir; arrange the eggplants on the onion mixture in the bottom of the casserole and with a spoon stuff the garlic slices into the slashes in the eggplants.
7. Add the pan contents to the casserole dish and work it into the slashes in the eggplants as well.  At this point the casserole dish should be really full!
8. Season to taste and pour the remaining oil over the contents; cover the casserole with a sheet of foil and then the lid.  This should ensure that it is thoroughly sealed.
9. Cook in the oven for 40 minutes or until the eggplants are really soft.  If you like a thick sauce remove the lid for the last 10 minutes to allow it to dry off a little.
10. Allow the dish to cool off until it is lukewarm then sprinkle with the remaining parsley and serve.,

Cook until meat is browned well stir in celery and cook 5 minutes longer.  Stir in rice and turkey liver and cook 3 minutes.  Add all remaining ingredients season generously with salt and pepper.
2. Your bird is ready to be stuffed!
3. To prepare chestnuts: I do them in the pressure cooker.  Rinse chestnuts and put them in the cooker.  Add enough water to cover by a good 2 inches and throw in 2 tblsps salt (this will be drained off anyway- but gives the chestnuts better flavour).  Boil for 5 minutes (after pressure starts).  Turn off heat and leave on element 15 minutes longer.  Drain.
4. When cool enough to handle cut off'nib' with a small sharp knife and peel.  Get the papery stuff off too.  This is not so easy- some chestnuts peel easer than others but they are so good and this is so totally worth it!
5. If you don't have a pressure cooker you can boil them in a regular pot for about 25 minutes.
6. You could also use the vacuum-packed cleaned chestnuts available but I don't know if they'd be as tasty.  I would guess that just over 1 lb of cleaned cooked chestnuts would equal a 2 lb uncleaned weight.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 420°F  A reviewer has suggested spraying the baking pan with Pam - that sounds like a great idea!
2. Put all the ingredients into a baking pan large enough to hold them.
3. Season generously with sea salt and black pepper.
4. Make sure your hands are very clean and put them in the pan and give everything a toss to distribute.
5. The garlic will drop into the water/oil solution but its flavour will permeate the potatoes and this way it won't burn.
6. Bake for 40 minutes.
7. When a nice golden-brown crust has formed on the potatoes give them a stir to bring the white underside up season lightly with a bit more sea salt and pepper and just a light sprinkling of oregano.
8. Add 1/2 cup more water if pan appears to be getting dry and pop back into oven to brown other side of potatoes.
9. This will take about another 40 minutes.
10. Do not be afraid of overcooking the potatoes- they will be delicious.

2. Trim the leeks wash thoroughly and pat the leaves dry with paper towelling then cut into 2.5cm (1 inch) pieces.  I find using the kitchen scissors is the quickest and easiest way to do this.
3. Peel and crush the garlic heat the oil in a pan or wok preferably non-stick and sauté the tomatoes and garlic for 2-3 minutes; then stir in the lemon juice the leeks and the 150ml (5 fluid ounces) of vegetable stock and bring to the boil.
4. Season the leek mixture and stir in the sugar cover with a lid or foil and cook for 5 minutes then remove the lid give the leek mixture a stir and cook for a further 5 minutes or until the leeks are just tender and the liquid has evaporated.
5. Transfer the leek mixture to a bowl stir in the olives cool it completely then chill for 30 minutes.  Crumble the feta then stir it into the leek mixture.  Garnish with parsley and lemon wedges and serve.
6. A fascinating fact about olive trees: Olive trees are extremely long-lived.  The famous olive tree under which Plato the ancient Greek philosopher sat in Athens is still growing!  Two and a half thousand years later!,

2. To make Walnut Feta add walnuts nutritional yeast and sea salt to a food processor.  Process until the walnuts become grainy making sure to stop and scrape down the sides when necessary.  Add olive oil and continue to process until small clumps form.  Do not over process it will eventually become a paste-like texture.

4. Preheat a cast iron skillet over medium heat.  Add olive oil shallots and garlic.  When it begins to sizzle add the salt.  Saute until shallots begin to lightly brown.  Add mushrooms artichokes and zucchini continually stirring mixture so that no sticking occurs.  Lightly salt and saute until mushrooms release their moisture and the vegetables are tender.  Remove from heat and add the nutritional yeast and cumin.  Mix thoroughly until vegetables are evenly coated.
5. Fill tomatoes to the brim with the vegetable mixture and then sprinkle on the walnut feta.  Place in a large casserole dish and bake in preheated oven for about 15 minutes or until walnut feta is lightly browned.  If left in the oven for too long tomatoes will begin to split down the sides.

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line two large cookie sheets with parchment paper; set aside. In a food processor combine blanched almonds and 1 cup of the powdered sugar. Cover and process until very finely ground. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl combine egg whites salt and vanilla. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form (tips curl). Gradually add the remaining 1 cup powdered sugar about 1 tablespoon at a time beating on high speed just until stiff peaks form (tips stand straight). Sprinkle about one-fourth of the almond mixture over the egg mixture; fold in with a large spatula. Continue sprinkling and folding in almond mixture one-fourth at a time until the two mixtures are combined.
3. Transfer macaroon mixture to a large pastry bag fitted with a large round tip (about 1/2-inch). Pipe half the macaroon mixture into 1-inch circles on prepared cookie sheets. Pipe remaining half of the macaroon mixture into 1-inch mounds on prepared cookie sheets. Sprinkle tops of mounds with finely chopped shredded coconut.
4. Bake in a preheated oven about 10 minutes or just until set (cookies shouldn't crack). Cool cookies completely on cookie sheets on wire racks. Peel cookies from parchment paper.

instructions, 1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Cut the dried base and green leaves from the cauliflower and discard them. Separate the head into florets about the size of walnuts and chop the stem into similar size pieces. Cut the potatoes into similar-size pieces as well.
2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high head and salt liberally. Add 1 tablespoon of vinegar and the cauliflower and potatoes (the vinegar will help keep the cauliflower white). Cook until the cauliflower pieces are tender enough to be easily cut with a spoon 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.
3. While the cauliflower is cooking make a cheese sauce. In a medium heavy-bottom saucepan melt the butter over medium-low heat and stir in the leeks. Cook until they are soft about 10 minutes. Add the flour and whisk to make a smooth paste. Add the milk a little at a time cooking until it thickens. When all the milk has been added reduce the heat and cook over medium-low heat for 5 to 10 minutes.
4. Stir in the crème fraiche and then one-half cup of the Gruyère 1 teaspoon salt and a generous grating of nutmeg (a little less than one-quarter teaspoon). Whisk until smooth then taste and add more salt or nutmeg if necessary.
5. Butter a 6-cup gratin dish and spread a thin layer of the sauce evenly over the bottom. Arrange the cooked cauliflower and potatoes in an even layer over the sauce. Pour the remaining sauce over the top and spread evenly with the back of a spoon. It should come about three-quarters of the way up the vegetables.
6. Scatter bread crumbs evenly over top and then scatter the remaining one-quarter cup Gruyère over that. Bake until the gratin is bubbling and the top is browned 30 to 40 minutes. Serve immediately.,

instructions, 1. Sprinkle the sliced apples with a few drops of lemon juice to prevent them from turning brown as well as to add a note of acidity to the finished sauce.
2. Cook the apples in a covered saucepan with 2 tablespoons of white wine. This may seem like a small amount of liquid but the apples themselves will release liquid as soon as they are heated by the steaming wine.
3. As soon as the apples are soft usually after about 10 minutes puree them in a food processor or food mill. If the sauce is very watery you can return the sauce to the pan and gently cook on medium-low heat until the liquid has evaporated reducing heat if necessary. However be careful to stir the mixture constantly with a wooden spoon and not allow it to burn.
4. The proportion of apple puree to mayonnaise will vary depending on the apples’ flavor; anywhere from one part apple puree and three parts good quality mayonnaise will work.
5. Flavor the apple/mayonnaise with grated horseradish about 1 tablespoon per cup.
6. I use freshly grated horseradish when I can find it (usually around Easter/Passover) and jarred all other times.

instructions, 1. In a 5 or 6 quart bowl or lidded food storage container dump in the water and add the yeast and salt (herbs as well if using). Because we are mixing in the flour so quickly it doesn’t matter that the salt and yeast are thrown in together. If you are using the fresh cake yeast break it up.
2. Dump in the flour all at once and stir with a long handled wooden spoon or a Danish dough whisk which is one of the tools that makes the job so much easier!
3. Stir it until all of the flour is incorporated into the dough. It will be a wet rough dough.
4. Put the lid on the container but do not snap it shut. You want the gases from the yeast to escape. (You could put a little hole in the top of the lids so that you could close the lids and still allow the gases to get out.).
5. Allow the dough to sit at room temperature for about 2 hours to rise. When you first mix the dough it will not occupy much of the container. But after the initial 2 hour rise it will pretty much fill it. (If you have decreased the yeast you will have to let it go longer than 2 hours.)  DO NOT PUNCH DOWN THE DOUGH! Just let it settle by itself.
6. The dough will be flat on the top and some of the bubbles may even appear to be popping. (If you intend to refrigerate the dough after this stage it can be placed in the refrigerator even if the dough is not perfectly flat. The yeast will continue to work even in the refrigerator.) The dough can be used right after the initial 2 hour rise but it is much easier to handle when it is chilled.  It is intended for refrigeration and use over the next two weeks ready for you anytime. The flavor will deepen over that time developing sourdough characteristics.
7. The next day when you pull the dough out of the refrigerator you will notice that it has collapsed and this is totally normal for this type of  dough. It will never rise up again in the container.
8. Dust the surface of the dough with a little flour just enough to prevent it from sticking to your hands when you reach in to pull a piece out.
9. You should notice that the dough has a lot of stretch once it has rested. (If your dough breaks off instead of stretching your dough is probably too dry and you can just add a few tablespoons of water and let it sit again until the dough absorbs the additional water.).
10. At this point you can divide the dough into 4 one pound balls and freeze them in airtight containers for up to three weeks. Allow 24 hours in refrigerator to thaw before use. You can also leave the dough in its container in the refrigerator for up to 14 days cutting off pieces as needed.
11. When ready to bake cut off a 1-pound piece of dough using kitchen shears and hold in your hands. Add a little more flour so it will not stick to your hands. Gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides rotating the ball a quarter turn as you go. Most of the dusting flour will fall off; it's not intended to be incorporated into the dough. The correctly shaped final product will be smooth and cohesive.
12. Rest the loaf on a generous layer of corn meal or a sheet of parchment paper on top of a pizza peel. Let the dough rest for at least 40 minutes (although letting it go 60 or even 90 minutes will give you a more open hole structure in the interior of the loaf. This may also improve the look of your loaf and prevent it from splitting on the bottom. ) You will notice that the loaf does not rise much during this rest in fact it may just spread sideways this is normal for this type of dough.
13. Twenty minutes before baking preheat the oven to 450 degrees F with a baking stone on the center rack with a metal broiler tray on the bottom (never use a glass vessel for this or it will shatter) which will be used to produce steam. (The tray needs to be at least 4 or 5 inches away from your stone to prevent it from cracking.).
14. Dust the top of the loaf with more flour so the knife will not stick. Cut the loaf with 1/4-inch slashes using a serrated knife. If your slashes are too shallow you will end up with an oddly shaped loaf and also prevent it from splitting on the bottom.
15. Slide the loaf into the oven onto the preheated stone and add a cup of hot water to the broiler tray. Quickly close the oven door. Bake the bread for 30-35 minutes or until a deep brown color. To insure that you get the best results it is crucial to have an Oven Thermometer to make sure your oven is accurate.
16. If you used parchment paper you will want to remove it after about 20-25 minutes to crisp up the bottom crust. Continue baking the loaf directly on the stone for the last 5-10 minutes.
17. Allow the loaf to cool on a rack until it is room temperature. If you cut into a loaf before it is cooled you will have a tough crust and a gummy interior. It is hard to wait but you will be happy you did! Make sure you have a nice sharp Bread Knife that will not crush the bread as you cut. Or you can tear it apart as they do in most of Europe.
18. If you have any leftover bread just let it sit uncovered on the cutting board or counter with the cut side down. If you cover a bread that has a crust it will get soggy.,

instructions, 1. Mixing and storing the dough: Whisk together the flour yeast salt and vital wheat gluten in a 5-quart bowl or a lidded (not airtight) food storage container.
2. Combine the liquid ingredients and mix them with the dry ingredients without kneading using a spoon a 14-cup food processor or a heavy duty stand mixer with paddle.
3. The dough will be loose but will firm up when chilled. Don't try to use it without chilling for at least 2 hours. You may notice lumps in the dough but they will be gone in the finished product.
4. Cover (not airtight) and allow the dough to rest at room temperature until it rises and collapses approximately 2 hours.
5. Refrigerate it for at least 2 hours before using. The dough can be stored and used over the next 5 days or store the dough in the freezer for up to two weeks in an airtight container. Freeze it in 2 lb portions. When using frozen dough thaw it in the refrigerator for 24 hours before use then allow the usual rest/rise times.
6. On baking day grease a non-stick brioche mold or an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch nonstick loaf pan. Dust the surface of the refrigerated dough with flour and cut off a 2-pound (cantaloupe-size) piece of dough (you can make a one-pounder as well). Dust the piece with more flour and quickly shape it into a ball. Place the ball into the prepared pan and allow to rest loosely covered with plastic wrap for about 1 hour 45 minutes. (dough should no longer feel cold and will have a bit of spring to it).
7. Thirty minutes before baking time preheat the oven to 350 degrees F with a rack in the middle of the oven where your baking stone should sit. If not using a baking stone a 5-minute preheat should be enough.
8. Just before baking use a pastry brush to paint the loaf’s top with egg wash.
9. Bake the loaf near the center of the oven for about 40-45 minutes. For smaller or larger loaves you will need to adjust the resting and baking times–a one-pounder should need only about 35 to 40 minutes in the oven.
10. Remove the brioche from the pan and allow it to cool on a rack before slicing. If it refuses to come out of the pan allow to rest in hot pan for 10 minutes and it should unstick to the sides and slide out.,

5. Line a flat tray with waxed paper; set aside. Melt the dark chocolate chips in a double boiler(or in microwave). Using toothpicks to hold the berries dip them in in the dark chocolate so they are completely coated. Work quickly so the cream doesn't melt. Allow the excess chocolate to drip off and then set the berries on the prepared tray. Repeat dipping the berries until a thick coating of chocolate has formed. Remove the toothpicks and while the chocolate is still soft sprinkle the berries lightly with the cacao nibs(if you don't have use grated dark or bittersweet chocolate) and fleur de sel so they stick to the berries. Freeze the raspberries until firm and serve cold.,

instructions, 1. Adjust rack to middle position in oven and then heat to 400.  Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.   Place the puff pastry on the parchment.   Bake until golden brown and puffed 10-15 minutes.  Transfer to a serving platter; press lightly to flatten if domed.
2. Meanwhile melt butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over  high heat.  Remove the pan from heat and spinkle evenly with the sugar.  Lay the apples in the skillet.  Return to heat.  Cook stirring apples halfway through until the juices in the pan turn a rich amber color and apples are carmelized about 15 minutes.
3. Remove apples from the pan one at a time.  Arrange them in overlapping rows on the pastry square leaving a 1/2-inch border.  Spoon about half of the pan juices over the apples.
4. Whisk the cream and Grand Marnier (if using) into the remaining juices in the pan.  Bring to a simmer.  Pour some sauce over the tart just before serving passing the remaining sauce separately.
5. FOR PEAR TATIN:  Substitute 2 lbs. pears (about 4) for the apples.  You may need to increase the carmelization time to 20-25 minutes.  Use Poire William instead of Grand Marnier if using a liquor.
6. LIQUOR OPTION FOR APPLES:  Cognac.  I believe it is a classically French pairing with apple desserts.  It's not the Cook's Illustrated version tho if you want to use strictly their recipe.  I used it in a different tart recipe once and it was awesome.  Thanks to the first reviewer for this idea!,

source, , 
instructions, 1. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 425°F Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.
2. Cut the carrots and leeks into slender batons or sticks: First cut the carrots lengthwise in half then place the halves cut side down on the cutting board and cut crosswise in half or cut into chunks about 3 inches long. Cut the pieces into 1/8- to ¼-inch-thick matchsticks. If your carrots were fat and you think your matchsticks don’t look svelte enough cut them lengthwise in half. Cut the leeks in the same way.
3. Fit a steamer basket into a saucepan. Pour in enough water to come almost up to the steamer cover and bring to a boil. Drop the carrots leeks and 1 rosemary sprig into the basket cover and steam until the vegetables are tender enough to be pierced easily with the tip of a knife 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the vegetables and pat them dry; discard the rosemary sprig.
4. In a medium bowl whisk the eggs together with the crème fraîche or heavy cream. Add the mustard season with salt and white pepper — mustard has a tendency to be salty so proceed accordingly and whisk to blend. Taste and see if you want to add a little more of one or the other mustards.
5. Put the tart pan on the lined baking sheet and pour the filling into the crust. Arrange the vegetables over the filling — they can go in any which way but they’re attractive arranged in spokes coming out from the center of the tart. Top with the remaining rosemary sprig and give the vegetables a sprinkling of salt and a couple of turns of the peppermill.
6. Bake the tart for about 30 minutes or until it is uniformly puffed and lightly browned here and there and a knife inserted into the center of the custard comes out clean. Transfer the tart to a cooling rack and let it rest for 5 minutes before removing the sides of the pan.  Serve hot warm or at room temperature (or lightly chilled).,

instructions, 1. FOOD PROCESSOR METHOD:  Put the flour sugar and salt in the processor and whir a few times until the butter is coarsely mixed into the flour. Beat the egg with the ice water and pour it into the bowl in 3 small additions whirring after each one (Don't overdo it - the dough shouldn't form a ball or ride on the blade) You'll have a moist malleable dough that will hold together when pinched. Turn the dough out onto a work surface gather it into a ball (if the dough doesn't come together easily push it a few spoonfuls at a time under the heel of your hand or knead it lightly) and flatten it into a disk.
2. HAND METHOD: Put the flour sugar and salt in a large bowl. Drop in the bits of butter and using your hands or a pastry blender work the butter into the flour until it is evenly distributed. You'll have large and small butter bits and that's fine - uniformity isn't a virtue here. Beat the egg and water together drizzle over the dough and using your fingertips mix and knead the dough until it comes together. Turn it out onto a work surface gather it into a ball (if the dough doesn't come together easily push it a few spoonfuls at a time under the heel of your hand or knead it some more) and flatten it into a disk.
3. Chill at least 3 hours or up to 5 days.
4. When you're ready to bake the tart shell butter a 9 - 91/2inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom (butter it even if it's nonstick).
5. To roll out the dough:  Roll out the dough between sheets of wax paper or plastic wrap or in a lightly floured rolling cover; or you can roll it out on a lightly floured work surface. If you're working between sheets of paper or plastic wrap lift it often so that it doesn't roll into the dough and turn the dough over frequently. If you're just rolling on the counter make sure to lift and turn the dough and reflour the counter often. The rolled-out dough should be about 1/4 inch thick and at least 12 inches in diameter.
6. Transfer the dough to the tart pan easing it into the pan without stretching it.  (What you stretch now will shrink in the oven later.)  If you'd like to reinforce the sides of the crust you can fold some of the excess dough over so that you have a double thickness around the sides. Using the back of a table knife trim the dough even with the top of the pan. Prick the base of the crust in several places with a fork.
7. Chill - freeze - the dough for at least 1 hour before baking.
8. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F Press a piece of buttered foil (or use nonstick foil) against the crust's surface. If you'd like you can fill the covered crust with rice or dried beans (which will be inedible after this but can be used for baking for months to come) to keep the dough flat but this isn't really necessary if the crust is well chilled. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper and put the tart pan on the sheet.
9. TO PARTIALLY BAKE THE CRUST:  Bake for 20 minutes then very carefully remove the foil (with the rice or beans). Return the crust to the oven and bake for another 3 - 5 minutes or until it is lightly golden. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and allow the crust to cool before you fill it.
10. TO FULLY BAKE THE CRUST:  Bake for an additional 10 minutes or until it is an even golden brown. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and allow the crust to cool before you fill it.,

instructions, 1. Process 1/2 cup pecans 1 tablespoon light brown sugar and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon in food processor until coarsely ground 12 to 15 one-second pulses (you should have about 1/2 cup crumbs).
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Place bread on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake bread until almost dry throughout (center should remain slightly moist) about 16 minutes flipping slices halfway through cooking. Remove bread from rack and let cool 5 minutes. Return baking sheet with wire rack to oven and reduce temperature to 200 degrees.
3. Whisk milk yolks sugar cinnamon 2 tablespoons melted butter salt vanilla and rum in large bowl until well blended. Transfer mixture to 13- by 9-inch baking pan.
4. Soak bread in milk mixture until saturated but not falling apart 20 seconds per side. Using firm slotted spatula pick up bread slice and allow excess milk mixture to drip off; repeat with remaining slices. Place soaked bread on another baking sheet or platter. Sprinkle each slice of soaked bread with 1 tablespoon nut mixture.
5. Heat ½ tablespoon butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-low heat. When foaming subsides use slotted spatula to transfer 2 slices soaked bread to skillet—nut mixture side down—and cook until golden brown 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and continue to cook until second side is golden brown 3 to 4 minutes longer. (If toast is cooking too quickly reduce temperature slightly.) Transfer to baking sheet in oven. Wipe out skillet with paper towels. Repeat cooking with remaining bread 2 pieces at a time adding ½ tablespoon of butter for each batch. Serve warm passing maple syrup separately.,

2. Warm the cream in a small saucepan. Don't bring to a boil just heat the cream.
3. Meanwhile beat the eggs well in a medium-sized bowl. Add the sugar and beat into the eggs. When cream is heated add gradually to the eggs while beating. Add vanilla while beating.
4. Prepare the water bath by placing both ramekins in the chosen baking dish. Fill the dish with warm water so it reaches two thirds up the sides of the ramekins. Fill the ramekins with the liquid custard.
5. Bake for 30 minutes at 300 degrees. Reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees and bake for another 30 to 60 minutes until custard is set. Custard is set if it only has a pudding-like jiggle when you gently jostle the ramekin. If it has a liquid-like slosh keep baking at 275. Chill the custard for at least two hours.
6. Add the garnish by covering the tops of the chilled custards with sugar (it should stick to the top of the custard so you can just pour out the excess). Preheat the broiler. Put the ramekins under the broiler for about a minute or two leaving the oven or broiler door open. In the alternative caramelize the sugar with a creme brulee torch.,

instructions, 1. Wash top and tail the small zucchinis.
2. Slice each in half then slice into julienne strips thin like thin french fries. At this stage they can be put into a plastic bag or bowl and kept until needed.
3. To prepare: Squeeze the juice from 1/2 of the lemon -- you should have about 3 - 4 tablespoons. In a bowl toss the zucchini strips using a large spoon with the lemon juice until damp. Use more lemon juice if necessary.
4. Mix the flour and cornflour (less than the 1/3 cup mentioned: my maths is bad) in a bowl and add the black pepper and seasoning salt. (You can actually leave out the salt and rather put flaky sea salt on the table for salting later).
5. Chuck this flour mixture into the bowl of zucchini fries and toss until more or less coated -- neat work is not necessary.
6. Heat about 1 inch of oil in a medium saucepan preferably with heavy bottom.
7. When hot using a slotted metal spoon add a good heaped spoonful of zucchini strips to the oil. (I find that it takes about 10 minutes for the zucchini to actually start browning).
8. You can fry them until just done (they won't be crisp but still nice) or you can fry them until golden brown. They do not colour evenly which doesn't matter.
9. Put out a few thicknesses of kitchen paper towels next to the pot. When the zucchini strips turn colour take out with slotted spoon and let drain on the kitchen paper. Repeat process.
10. The quantity given above was about 4 batches to fry (it depends on the saucepan and you!).
11. Tip each drained batch into an oven dish and keep warm -- but serve as soon as possible while crisp. Flaky sea salt on unseasoned fries is delicious.,

instructions, 1. Thoroughly wash and scrub the potatoes and  cut them into thin slices.
2. Add the potato slices to a non-stick pan (one that will fit easily under the grill) pour in the milk gently bring to the boil then reduce the heat and and simmer for 10-12 minutes or until the potato slices are just cooked but still firm.
3. Drain the potato slices thoroughly and reserve the milk in a jug or bowl.
4. Peel crush and finely chop the garlic.
5. Layer the drained potato slices in the pan.
6. Put the yoghurt in a bowl season to taste add the nutmeg and garlic and slowly stir in the reserved milk (see notes below).
7. Pour the yoghurt mixture over the potato slices cook over a gentle heat for 15 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked through.
8. Preheat the grill remove the pan from the heat sprinkle the cheese over the potatoes and grill the potatoes in the pan for 2-3 minutes or until golden-brown on top.
9. Serve topped with parsley with a tomato salad drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette and grilled fish or chicken.
10. Chef's Notes: It is important to add the warm milk to the yoghurt very slowly.  If the milk is too hot or is added too quickly the yoghurt will start to curdle.  Although I have said it is okay to use low-fat milk unless you've found a low-fat or reduced-fat cheese which actually has some flavour I don't recommend using either of these.  The ones I have tried have always been horribly bland virtually tasteless in fact.  I haven't tried this option in this particular recipe but sometimes 50% of a low-fat cheese and 50% parmesan can be a good compromise (in this recipe 50g of each instead of the 100g Cheddar).  In view of the fat content in this dish personally I'd prefer to simply opt for making it occasionally and enjoying it - without low-fat compromises!,

instructions, 1. Mix the warm milk & yeast in a bowl. Leave to stand for a few minutes.
2. Sift the 1oz of flour into the milk & yeast mix add the 1 tsp of sugar & mix well. Leave to stand in a warm place for 10 mins or until frothy (will look a little like mousse!).
3. While the starter is standing sift the flour & salt into a mixing bowl. Add the vanilla sugar then rub in the butter. ( rub in method - rub the butter into the flour to create 'bread crumbs' - like you do with short crust pastry)).
4. When the starter is frothy whisk in the 2 eggs. When the eggs are fully incorporated pour the mixture into mixing bowl & stir the ingredients until they come together to form a ball.
5. Remove the ball of dough & knead on a lightly floured surface for a minute or until no longer sticky.
6. Place the dough on a lightly floured dish or tray cover & let rest in a warm place for around 90 minutes or until roughly doubled in size.
7. When doubled in size knead the dough again for another minute - just to knock the air out a bit.
8. Dust a work surface with flour then divide the dough into 12 equal pieces ( cut dough into quarters then cut each quarter into thirds).
9. Lightly grease a baking tin then place the balls inside - 3 in the middle of the tin & 9 around the edges - make sure there are spaces in between.
10. Place in a preheated oven at 230 c for around 18 minutes. Start checking the brioche at 15 minutes remove from oven when pale gold all over.
11. Remove from tin & allow to cool.Put the icing sugar in a bowl and slowly add a tiny bit of hot water at a time until you have a thick icing that you drizzle over the brioche. Slowly drizzle the icing over the brioch until it is almost covered.
12. Tear off a piece when you want & enjoy!,

2. Place apples in your crockpot and pour the Crème de cassis over them.
3. Cook on low for 5-6 hours or on high for 2-3 hours or until apples are very tender. Your home will smell WONDERFUL during this time.
4. For a chunkier sauce (my recommendation) mash apples with a potato masher. You can do this right in the hot crockpot. For a smooth sauce like store-bought versions puree mixture in a food processor or blender.
5. Chill tightly covered until ready to serve.,

instructions, 1. To make the creme anglaise place 1 cup of the cream in a medium saucepan over low heat. Scrape the seeds of the vanilla bean pod into the cream then drop in the pod too. Bring just to a simmer. Remove from the heat and allow to infuse for 30 minutes.
2. In a small bowl combine the sugar and salt. In a medium bowl whisk the yolks. Whisk half of the sugar-salt mixture into the cream and whisk the other half into the egg yolks. Slowly pour the warm cream into the bowl with the egg yolks whisking constantly until incorporated. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and return the pan to low heat.
3. Cook the mixture stirring constantly but not vigorously until the mixture thickens making sure to prevent the mixture from curdling. When thickened remove the mixture from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a medium bowl discarding any solids and the vanilla pod. Whisk in the remaining one-half cup heavy cream and whisk over an ice water bath to cool. Cool the creme anglaise in the refrigerator preferably overnight for the flavors to develop.
4. To make the French toast heat a saute pan or griddle over medium heat until hot. Add enough of the clarified butter to thinly coat the surface of the pan. Dip the bread one slice at a time into the creme anglaise to coat on both sides then remove shaking off any excess batter.
5. Place the bread on the pan or griddle and grill 2 minutes per side until golden brown on both sides. Remove and set aside in a warm place. To serve place four slices on a warm plate and serve immediately with softened butter and maple syrup on the side.,

Remove the bowl from the mixer and using your hands gently fold in half the thyme the ricotta parmesan and half a teaspoon of sea salt. Set aside.

Lay the tomato slices on top of each sheet in three long rows with a fair amount of overlap between the rows (tomatoes shrink a fair bit when exposed to heat). Sprinkle over the anchovies if using and remaining thyme. Drizzle the tomatoes with half the olive oil and season with some sea salt and a generous grind of black pepper.

2. Preheat the oven to 200C 400F or Gas Mark 6.
3. Using 1 ounce of the butter grease the muffin or Yorkshire pudding tins well. You can line the base with greaseproof baking paper for ease of removal if you wish.
4. Arrange the potatoes in the tin/s holes in layers - seasoning every other layer or so with the crushed garlic salt & pepper.
5. Carry on until all the potatoes are used up.
6. Stir the creme fraiche with a wooden spoon to thin it down a bit - and then place a spoon on top of each mini potato gratin.
7. Sprinkle some grated cheese on top and then top each gratin with flecks of the remaining butter.
8. Grate some nutmeg on top and bake in the oven for about 30 to 45 minutes; it depends on which tin you are using - a muffin tin will take less time to bake than a Yorkshire Pudding tin as the holes are smaller!
9. Serve with all types of daubes casseroles stews roast dinners OR as a light lunch with crisp green salad & crusty French bread!
10. To freeze:
11. Freeze in the tin after assembling them and when frozen remove and place into zip-lock bags or plastic containers.(It is best to line the base with greasproof paper if you intend to freeze them - they are easier to remove from the tin!).
12. Defrost and bake on a large greased and/or lined baking tray - temperature as before; or place into muffin/Yorkshire pudding tins to help keep their shape. I never need to do this - please see my photosit's up to you!,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
2. In a medium-sized bowl combine cocoa and cornstarch thoroughly.
3. Add a little of the cream and whisk to make a smooth paste.
4. Whisk in remaining cream and the liqueur.
5. I have made this with Kahlua Grand Marnier Chambord and brandy-- they're all good.
6. If you use the evaporated milk instead of cream expect the mixture to be pretty soupy.
7. In a large bowl beat egg whites until almost stiff.
8. Slowly beat in sugar and beat until stiff and glossy.
9. Now gently whisk a quarter of the egg whites into the cocoa mixture.
10. Gently fold in another quarter.
11. Now add all this mixture into the remainder of the egg whites and gently fold until well blended.
12. Spoon the souffle batter into 6-to-8 1/2-cup sized custard cups.
13. The volume you get will depend on how well you beat the egg whites and if you folded them into the cocoa mixture without deflating them too much.
14. Don't worry even if you only get 6 they will be wonderful.
15. Set custard cups into a deep baking pan and carry this to the oven.
16. Open oven pull out rack and set down pan.
17. Now pour very hot tap water in the baking pan to come up about one-inch around the outside of the custard cups.
18. (I do it this way so I don't have to carry the pan with the souffles and water to the oven-- it's heavy and you risk sloshing water into your souffles.) Slide in oven rack close oven door and bake for 25 minutes.
19. The centres will be a little runny as they should be.
20. Serve immediately.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 400F degrees.
2. TO MAKE CRUST:
3. Unfold crescent dough from the tube and press dough evenly into the bottom and up the sides of tart pan to form a crust pressing gently to seal any perforations; spread crust with pesto. (NOTE: If you will be using a shortcrust pastry recipe instead of the crescent roll dough you will need to blind-bake it before adding the filling).
4. TO MAKE FILLING:
5. In a large skillet saute the zucchini onion and garlic in the olive oil until softened about 10 minutes. Stir in the parsley and the herbes de Provence and season with salt and pepper to taste. Let cool slightly before stirring in the beaten eggs and cheese.
6. With a slotted spoon transfer the filling into the prepared tart shell and  spread evenly; sprinkle the top with a little extra grated cheese. I transfer the tart to a baking sheet to catch any overflow. Bake at 400 F until set and crust is golden about 16 to 19 minutes.
7. Remove to a wire rack and let cool slightly about 10 minutes before removing sides of pan.
8. TIP: For ease of removal place the tart on a large can then carefully pull the sides of the pan down around it (you may need to run a knife around sides of crust to loosen).
9. Slide tart off the bottom portion of the pan onto a rimless serving dish or cutting board (or leave it on the base to serve). Let rest 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
10. Good served warm cold or at room temperature.,

instructions, 1. Add beer and water to the pan.  The water should be just slightly warmer than room temperature.
2. Add one cup of the flour to the pan.
3. Add the salt and the gluten by sprinkling over the flour in the pan.  Add the remaining flour.
4. Follow the usual routine of poking a hole in the middle of the flour and add the yeast.  Use your fingers to push a little flour over the yeast to seal the hole.
5. Run the machine on the French bread medium-crust setting.
6. Given the relatively high hydration of this recipe I suggest that you resist the temptation to raise the lid on the machine during final rise and baking in order to reduce the likelihood of the top of the loaf falling.
7. For the beer I use PBR; but I suspect that any regular lager or light beer will produce similar results.
8. Flour:  I use King Arthur unbleached bread flour.  I live in South Florida (warm and humid) so you may need to make adjustments to the flour/liquid measurements to suit your local conditions.
9. Yeast:  I use Fleischmann’s bread machine yeast (glass jar).,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 475 F or 240 degrees C.
2. Dust a flat surface with flour and roll out the puff pastry very thinly.
3. Cut out four circles using a saucer as a guide.
4. Sprinkle a little water on an oiled baking sheet and lay out the circles of pastry.
5. Lightly prick the pastry all over with the tips of a fork to stop it rising as it cooks and pushing off the apples.
6. Squeeze the lemon juice into a mixing bowl and stir in the caster sugar.
7. Peel core and slice the apples into thin segments.
8. As you work place them in the sweetened lemon juice to keep them from browning.
9. Cover the pastry with the apple slices in overlapping circles.
10. Then sprinkle icing sugar over each tart and dot with butter.
11. Place the baking sheet in the oven and cook for 10 minutes or until the pastry is crisp and golden and the apples are tender and scorched in places.
12. Serve hot warm or cold with the cream whipped if you like with whisky.
13. To do this in true French style use calvados.
14. Another impressive way to serve this dish (although you'll need more liquor than this recipe calls for) is to sprinkle a cinnamon/sugar mixture over the tart just before serving.
15. Then take the tart to the table pour the calvados over the entire face of the tart and light with a match.
16. Aside from wowing everyone with your talent the flames will carmelise the cinnamon/sugar mixture adding a crunchy topping.
