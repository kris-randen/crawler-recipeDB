cuisine, European >> French >> French, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. You will need two 8" (20cms) cake tins; greased and lined with baking paper. Pre-heat oven to 160C/325F/Gas 3.
2. Beat the butter and sugar together until light fluffy and pale golden brown - this is essential to make the mixture light and aids the cake to rise. It can take up to 15 minutes by hand or 5 to 10 minutes by hand-held mixer!
3. Add the baking powder to the flour and the milk and maple syrup to the beaten eggs.
4. Gently fold in a large spoon of flour followed by a spoon of egg mixture - mix gently but thoroughly between each addition of flour and egg mixture. Continue to add fold and mix until the flour and the egg mixture is finished. If the mixture is a little stiff add some more milk.
5. Add the chopped walnuts and gently mix through the cake mixture evenly. You should have a fairly stiff consistency that drops easily.
6. Put the cake mixture equally in to the prepared cake tins smoothing slightly on top with a slight indent in the middle then bake for between 25 and 35 minutes in a pre-heated oven. Different ovens vary; these cakes normally take 30 minutes to bake in my oven. (They are cooked when they are well-risen golden brown and when a wooden skewer comes out clean after being inserted into the middle of the cake.).
7. Allow them to cook in the tins for 5 minutes before carefully taking them out of the tins and allowing them to cool completely on a wire cooling tray/rack.
8. While the cakes are cooling make the fudge frosting/icing. Place all of the ingredients except the icing sugar into a saucepan and gently them all together until the sugar is dissolved. Allow to cool slightly and then add the icing sugar beating to a smooth and glossy finish.
9. Place one of the cakes on to a serving plate or tray if you wish you can cut each cake in half to make a multi layer cake. Spread some of the frosting/icing on top of the cake and scatter some chopped walnuts over the top if using. Place the other cake on top and pour the remaining fudge frosting/icing over the top of the cake allowing it to drizzle down the sides. Decorate the top of the cake with walnut halves.
10. Serve cut into slices - this cake makes about 8 to 10 slices. Preparation time includes the time to make the fudge frosting/icing.,

3. Sift the next 3 ingredients (flour through cinnamon) in a small bowl.
4. Transfer wet ingredients into a larger bowl and whisk dry ingredients into wets and ignore small flour lumps.
5. NOTE: Be sure to whisk batter before dipping each batch of toast. Also dont add any extra banana or milk to the batter (it will result in soggy toast).
6. Dip each side of the toast in the batter for a couple of seconds and allow some of the excess batter to drip off. (for the last piece of bread you will likely have to swab up the remaining batter. Don't worry if the toast tears just stick it back together on the frying pan).
7. Cook each side just over a minute or until browned to your desired colour.
8. Serve with lots of maple syrup. Refrigerate the leftovers and put them in the toaster the next day. OR cool on a cooking cooling rack and when completely cool wrap in foil and freeze. Warm in microwave then toast and enjoy!,

instructions, 1. First make the sauce:  Melt butter in a large saucepan.  Remove from heat and stir in flour salt and nutmeg until smooth.  Gradually add milk and stock or broth; bring to boiling stirring constantly; boil 2 minutes or until slightly thickened.
2. Using a wire whisk beat the egg yolks in a small bowl with the cream.  Beat in a little of the hot mixture.  Pour back into saucepan; cook over low heat stirring constantly until sauce is hot -- do not boil.  Remove from heat.  Stir in the sherry.
3. Meanwhile in a large stockpot bring 6 quarts of water to boiling; add 2 tablespoons salt and the spaghetti; cook as label directs; drain in colander.  Return spaghetti to kettle.  Add 2 cups sauce; toss lightly until spaghetti and sauce are well combined.
4. Combine turkey and mushrooms in a large bowl.  Add 2 cups of sauce to this mixture and mix well.
5. Divide the spaghetti in half and place in two 12 x 8 x82-inch baking dishes arranging around the edges.  Spoon half of the turkey mixture into the center of each dish.  Reserve rest of sauce for later use.  Sprinkle cheese over spaghetti in each dish.  Cover with foil; refrigerate 1 hour or overnight.
6. About 1 hour before serrving preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake covered 45 minutes.  reheat sauce; spoon over spaghetti in each dish.
7. Note:    The above preparation makes a company-attractive casserole.  However I usually  prefer to combine all the sauce with the spaghetti turkey and mushrooms in step 3.
8. Another note:  To freeze:  Line one of the baking dishes with foil; assemble casserole as directed.   Fold foil over to seal; freeze right in the dish.  When frozen lift out foil; remove dish from freezer.  To serve:  Unwrap return to casserole dish and let stand 1 hour to thaw.  Bake covered for 1 hour at 350 degrees or until bubbly.
9. One more note;  To make turkey stock:  Break up carcass.  Place in a stock pot with 3 cups water 3 parsley sprigs  2 carrots (pared and halved) 3 celery tops 2 onions (halved) 2 teaspoons salt 10 black peppercorns 1 bay leaf.  Bring to boiling; rduce heat; simmer covered 2 hours.  Strain.  Boil gently uncovered to reduce stock to 2 cups.  This may be done ahead.,

2. Pour boiling water to just cover the vegetables and bring to a simmer. Cover lower the heat to medium-low and simmer for 1 1/2 hours stirring regularly to make sure the vegetables don't stick to the bottom and adding boiling water if it no longer covers the vegetables. After cooking for 1 hour and 20 minutes add the macaroni and 1 cup boiling water and stir to combine. (The soup is best made a day ahead).
3. Two hours or less before serving prepare the pistou. Press the garlic cloves with a garlic press (or mince them finely) and combine the pulp and juices with the basil and grated cheese in a mortar. Grind into a paste with the pestle adding olive oil little by little until the pistou forms a smooth paste. (This can also be done in a food processor but the flavours won't be quite as stupendous and my grandmother won't be as proud of you). Transfer into a serving cup.
4. Fish out the bay leaves and thyme sprigs from the soup or just warn your guests not to eat them. Serve the soup hot or slightly warm with pistou on the side for each diner to stir a spoonful into his bowl.,

instructions, 1. In a bowl place the onions and cover with water. Add the vinegar and soak for one hour or longer. Drain rinse and dry on paper towels. Clean and dry the bowl.
2. Heat 2 tbsps of the oil over medium heat in a large heavy nonstick skillet. Add the onions cooking until tender about five minutes. Add a large pinch of salt along with the garlic and the thyme.
3. Continue to cook until the onions are lightly colored but not browned about five more minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly in the bowl used for soaking previously.
4. In a large bowl beat the eggs and stir in about 1/2 teaspoon of salt along with the pepper milk and onions. Clean and dry the pan.
5. Return to the burner and set on medium-high. Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in the skillet. Drop a bit of egg into the pan; if it sizzles and cooks at once the pan is ready.
6. Pour in the egg mixture. Tilt the pan to distribute the eggs and filling evenly over the surface. Shake the pan gently tilting it slightly with one hand while lifting up the edges of the frittata with the spatula in your other hand to let the eggs run underneath during the first few minutes of cooking.
7. Turn the heat down to low cover and cook 10 minutes shaking the pan gently every once in a while.
8. From time to time remove the lid tilt the pan and loosen the bottom of the frittata with a wooden spatula so that it doesn’t burn. It should turn a golden color. The eggs should be just about set; cook a few minutes longer if they’re not.
9. While the eggs are cooking heat the broiler. Uncover the pan and place it under the broiler not too close to the heat for up to three minutes. Watch very carefully to make sure the top doesn’t burn. You want it to get puffy and brown a little.
10. Remove from the heat and shake the pan to make sure the frittata isn’t sticking. Allow it to cool for between five minutes and fifteen minutes.
11. Loosen the edges with a wooden or plastic spatula. Carefully slide from the pan onto a large round platter.
12. Cut into wedges or into smaller bite-size diamonds. Serve hot warm at room temperature or cold.,

instructions, 1. In a metal bowl whisk the egg yolks sugar and salt until light. Whisk in the orange juice and lemon juice.
2. Set the bowl over a pot of lightly simmering water whisking until the mixture thickens and forms "ribbony" trails from the whisk. Don't beat hard simply a gentle back-and-forth motion over the pan will suffice to prevent overcooking.
3. Remove from heat and whisk in the Grand Marnier. Set aside.
4. To the simmering water add vinegar.
5. Crack two whole eggs into a small dish and gently add them to the simmering water. Poach for 3-4 minutes then gently remove to a plate and keep warm.
6. Heat a large non-stick pan and melt the butter swirling pan to distribute.
7. In a shallow bowl whisk the egg whites and one whole egg with the milk cinnamon nutmeg and salt.

name, Salted Butter Tart (With a Rich Caramel Filling), 
cuisine, European >> French >> French, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Make the pastry:  Combine the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse to mix. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles very coarse bread crumbs. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl.
2. In another bowl whisk together the egg and sugar. Pour the egg mixture over the flour-butter mixture and mix with a fork. Squeeze a bit of the mixture between your fingers. If it holds together transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface; if not add a couple of teaspoons of ice water and test again. Knead gently and form into a ball divide the pastry in half and flatten into 2 disks. Wrap each disk in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.
3. Make the tart:  Roll out the pastry on a floured surface and line a 9-inch or 9 1/2-inch (23-cm or 24-cm) tart pan. Prick the base of the tart with a fork and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
4. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
5. Place the tart shell on a baking sheet. Line the tart with parchment paper and fill it with dried beans. Bake until the pastry is just set about 15 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and continue to cook until the pastry is a dark golden color 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the tart to a wire rack and leave to cool completely.
6. Combine the sugar and butter in a deep heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir to mix and cook stirring occasionally until the butter and sugar caramelize 10 to 15 minutes. The sugar and butter will go through several stages. First it will look like a flour-butter roux then it will appear curdled and then the butter will leak out of the sugar mixture. Don’t worry: It will all come together in the end.
7. While the caramel is cooking pour the cream into a saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat and set aside.
8. Keep stirring the butter-sugar mixture watching carefully as it begins to caramelize and remembering that the heat in the pan will continue to cook the caramel once it is removed from the burner. You want a rich dark caramel color but you don’t want to burn the mixture which will give it a bitter taste. When the caramel reaches the right color remove the pan from the heat and slowly and carefully pour in the cream; the mixture will bubble and spit. When the caramel stops bubbling return it to low heat and cook for 5 minutes stirring to dissolve the caramel in the cream. Remove the pan from the heat and let the caramel cool for 10 minutes. Slowly pour the cooled caramel into the baked pastry shell and chill the tart for at least 2 hours.
9. This tart is easier to cut when it is chilled. Remove the tart from the pan and using a wet knife cut it into wedges. Serve the tart at room temperature however for maximum flavor with a dollop of whipped cream.,

instructions, 1. Prepare the Parmesan wafers. Combine 1/4 cup of the grated Parmesan (reserve the remaining cheese) with the flour in a small bowl. On the left half of a large nonstick skillet pour 1 tablespoon of the cheese mixture and use the back of the measuring spoon to spread it into a thin disk about 3 1/2 inches in diameter. Repeat with another tablespoon of the cheese mixture setting it on the right half of the skillet so the two disks don't touch. Set the skillet over high heat until the cheese is bubbly and is just starting to turn golden. Remove from heat and let cool for 30 seconds. Using a thin spatula loosen the disks cautiously from the skillet and transfer onto a rolling pin to give them a curved shape working quickly so the wafers won't have time to harden. Let cool completely. Rinse the skillet under cold water to cool it down wipe it dry and repeat to make two more wafers.

instructions, 1. Rinse the filet under lukewarm water and pat dry. Remove any remaining bones with tweezers pliers or a small child then cut salmon in half crosswise.
2. Place the filet pieces on a large piece of aluminum foil.
3. Sprinkle the sugar salt and pepper over 1/2 of the filet then completely cover that with a thick layer of dill making sure you only use the thin leaves of the dill and not the stems.  Sprinkle the wine on last. Place the other half of salmon on top like a sandwich skin side out.
4. Wrap up the foil into a firmly closed packet place on plate and put another plate on top. Weigh down with something heavy (I used a gallon of milk) on the top plate and put in the fridge for 48 hours turning the salmon every 12 hours to ensure even marinating.
5. When the salmon is ready remove all the dill and set aside then slice the salmon at a severe angle in the thinnest slices you can manage with an insanely sharp knife parallel to the skin.  The thinner the slice the better it tastes!
6. Serve with fresh dill and pepper on buttered fresh toast.

instructions, 1. Thinly slice the large and small truffles.
2. Loosen the skin at the neck of the chicken and insert your hand all the way down underneath the skin as far as the narrow part of the drumstick.  You want to carefully separate the skin from the flesh of the chicken.
3. Insert the truly slices using slices from the small truffle in the points of the breasts and narrow truffle slices for the legs.  Use slices from the large truffle over the breast thick and thick parts of the drumsticks.  Secure the neck skin beneath the wings tips and truss the chicken.
4. In a large lidded Dutch oven (a large Le Creuset pot works well) melt 2 tablespoons butter and add the white part of the leeks and the young carrots.  Place the truffled chicken on top of the vegetables and cook over medium heat turning the chicken until it is lightly browned on all sides.  Place the chicken on its side.
5. Add the white wine chicken stock salt and peppercorns and bring to a boil.  Cover tightly (this is where the Le Creuset pot works especially well as the lid is heavy) and braise for 90 minutes turning the chicken over at 20 minute intervals and adding more stock if necessary to keep the chicken at least half-covered at all times.  After 90 minutes turn off the heat keep covered and keep the chicken hot in the stock.
6. To make the sauce in a saucepan melt 1/4 cup butter then gradually stir in the flour and cook stirring for 3-5 minutes without allowing the mixture to brown.
7. Gradually stir in 3 cups of the broth from the cooked chicken (make sure not to include any peppercorns) then cook stirring until the sauce is smooth and thickened.  Stick the cloves in the small onion then put it and the carrot in the sauce and cook over low heat for 1 hour.  Remove the carrot onion and cloves.
8. Stir in bit by bit 1 tablespoon cold butter.
9. In a bowl beat the egg yolks then stir in about 3 tablespoons of the hot sauce.  Add this tempered mixture gradually to the remaining sauce stirring briskly and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the lemon juice stir adjust to taste then season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
10. Carefully remove the chicken from the remaining broth and place it in the center of a warm serving platter.  Surround it with the leeks and carrots and spoon the sauce over the chicken.  Serve and enjoy!
11. Note:  cooking the chicken on its side does seem a bit unusual but that’s how Mr. Price's original recipe reads.  I believe that it’s perhaps to keep the legs from separating from the body during cooking.,

3. In a bowl cream eggs and 1/4 cup sugar with a fork. Try to avoid incorporating any air into the mixture.
4. SLOWLY pour cream into egg while continuing to mix with the fork. Again avoid incorporating air. If you pour too quickly the cream will cook the egg instead of mixing with it.
5. Pour mixture into 4 ramekins and place into a water bath: put ramekins into a baking dish and add water to the baking dish so that it comes up the sides of the ramekins to the same height as the custard. Don't get any water into the ramekins!
6. Carefully place baking dish in the oven and bake 50-60 minutes. Actual time will depend on the geometry of your ramekins - shorter and wider bakes more quickly than taller more compact ramekins. Custard is done with it is set but still jiggly in the middle.
7. Carefully remove from oven (don't splash water onto the custards) and take the ramekins out of the water bath. Allow to cool to room temperature then cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least a couple hours (but not more than a day or so).
8. Immediately before serving cover each custard with about half a tablespoon of sugar and caramelize with a torch. You can attempt to caramelize the sugar in your oven's broiler but it's hard to control this way and you end up with some burned patches.,

You wouldn't think this is important but it is. It doesn't need to bleach it should just seem a little paler after a few minutes of beating.
4. Combine the two mixtures together and blend with a large wooden spoon. If it seems too crumbly or hard moisten with the tiniest bit of water. Add the lemon zest.
5. In a buttered cake tin spread out the mixture with the palm of your hand flattening the top as you go.
6. Using a knife or fork trace a criss-cross pattern over the galette - just for decoration. :).
7. Finally brush the egg yolk over the top of the galette to create that lovely golden look.
8. Bake for 45 minutes remove from the oven. Serve fresh or cool.,

instructions, 1. Thoroughly rinse the chicken and cut breasts in half lengthwise.  Thinly slice the chicken breast halves into discs just under 1/4" thick.  The goal is to have the chicken approximately the same thickness as chicken in take-out Chinese food dishes.  The slicing is where most of the prep time comes from.
2. Drain the chicken slices in a collender while you prepare the poaching liquid.
3. Slice the lemons and limes in half width-wise.  Use a citrus reamer or a juicer to extract the juices into a wide saucepan or chef's pan.  Add the white wine.
4. Heat on high until you see steam curling above the liquid.
5. Add the drained chicken and stir.  Cook until chicken is no longer pink stirring to keep the chicken moving to cook evenly.
6. After chicken is cooked through remove with slotted utensil to fresh collender nestled in a bowl.  Drain solids out of cooking liquid and return liquid to pan and bring to light boil.  Add honey and juices from chicken that have collected under the collender.  Boil until sauce reduces enough to thickly coat back of wooden spoon.
7. Serve chicken over seasoned rice and drizzle with sauce.  I use reduced sodium Rice-A-Roni.
8. Try substituting 1 - 2 oranges for the limes and current jelly for the honey. Very yummy!,

instructions, 1. In a large bowl combine the pancake mix with enough water to make a thin batter. Add nutmeg cinnamon vanilla sugar and eggs. Whisk together until smooth about 3 minutes.
2. In a medium bowl mix together walnuts brown sugar and banana slices.
3. Slice the ends off the French bread. Starting at 1 end measure about a half inch down the loaf and slice the bread 3/4 of the way through. Measure about another half inch and slice cleanly through the bread. You should have a 1-inch slice of bread with a cut down the middle. Repeat this process until the bread is all sliced up.
4. Take a piece of the cut French bread and stuff a few tablespoons of the banana mixture into the slit in the middle. Add a good amount but do not overstuff so that the mixture won't stay in the center. Repeat until all the slices are stuffed.
5. Preheat a skillet or flat-top grill over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot coat it with 2 tablespoons of butter.
6. Pour the crushed-up cornflakes onto a plate. Take a slice of stuffed bread and dip it into the egg mixture coating both sides liberally. Then press the bread into the cornflakes and flip it to coat both sides. Place the bread on the grill or skillet and cook until golden brown about 3 minutes per side. Flip the toast over and cook the other side. Repeat the coating and cooking process for each slice of bread and add more butter to the grill or skillet as necessary about 2 tablespoons of butter per slice.

instructions, 1. How to clarify butter: Melt the butter slowly. Let it sit for a bit to separate. Skim off the foam that rises to the top and gently pour the butter off of the milk solids which have settled to the bottom. A stick (8 tablespoons) of butter will produce about 6 tablespoons of clarified butter.
2. Arrange the fillets in a shallow dish and pour the milk over them. Let soak for at least 5 minute and up to 20 minute Set up your work area so that you can move quickly: position your serving plates or platter the milk soaking pan a pile of paper towels and the seasoned flour on a plate. Have the melted butter in a small heavy-based saucepan and the lemon juice and parsley ready for action.
3. In one or two large frying pans heat the clarified butter over medium-high heat until very hot but not quite smoking. Lift a fillet from the milk blot it on the paper towels dip it into the flour and shake off the excess. Carefully lay the fish in the hot fat. Repeat with the other fillets but don't overcrowd the pan or you'll have trouble flipping. Adjust the temperature to keep the fat sizzling briskly but not burning. Cook the fish until golden on one side about 2 minute With a slotted spatula a large spoon and great care gently flip the fish.
4. When the second side of the fish is golden brown and the flesh is tender when poked with a sharp knife in the thickest part use the slotted spatula to remove the sole set it on paper towels to drain briefly and arrange on the warm platter or plates.
5. When all the fillets are cooked heat the melted whole butter carefully over medium-high heat swirling the pan occasionally until the butter is fragrant and the milk solids turn nutty brown; remove the pan from the heat so the butter doesn't keep cooking but keep it hot.
6. Working fast pour 1 Tbs. of the lemon juice evenly over each fish and sprinkle on the parsley. Pour about 1-1/2 Tbs. of the hot browned butter on each fish -- if all has gone well you'll see and hear a delicious sizzle. (If there's no sizzle it will still taste great.) Serve immediately.,

instructions, 1. Reduce the beef stock by boiling down to half in a large stockpot over medium heat with semi-open lid.
2. Set the 2 onion halves on aluminum foil on a hot burner and caramelize the surfaces for approx 10 min minimum.
3. They need to burn black while doing so do not lift off the foil to check. The rim of the onion will turn black and then you can check.
4. This will not influence the taste of the consommé but make the color dark brown.
5. Chop all the vegetables (not the spices!) in the food processor till very coarse.
6. Add the beef cubes and pulse several more times but do not puree!
7. Put the mix into a bowl and add the 3 egg whites. Incorporate the mixture well and add the spices.
8. Whisk the mix into the warm beef stock reduction and let simmer without boiling.
9. Carefully stir mixture and scrape the bottom of the pot to prevent burning until the egg foam starts to rise to the top about 30 minute.
10. When the egg foam starts to solidify make a small hole into the middle with a wooden spoon this will keep the mass compact and easier to handle later.
11. Continue to simmer until the egg foam mixture is solid about another 30 minutes.
12. Remove pot from heat.
13. Skim the egg foam mix carefully off the top with a slotted ladle.*.
14. Line a sieve with dampened cheeseclothes or a cotton dishtowel and ladle the consommé 1 spoonful after another through the sieve into a big sauce pan.
15. If for any reason the consommé is NOT clear at this stage reheat and add 3 more egg whites to the consommé. This should pick up any left over particles in the liquid.
16. Always move the fluids slowly and carefully.
17. Repeat the sieving process if necessary.
18. Heat consommé gently and season with salt to taste.
19. The consommé should be of a warm brown color.

2. In a small bowl combine the onion powder garlic powder pepper and salt and rub them onto the roast coating it as much as you can.
3. Place the roast in a 5 quart crock pot and add the beef consommé French onion soup 3/4 of a soup can's worth of water and the Worcestershire sauce into the crock pot.
4. Cover and cook on LOW for 6 hours.
5. When the roast has cooked through remove the roast slice it thin and return the slices to the juice in the crock pot to absorb moisture and more flavor.
6. Meanwhile slice the hoagie rolls lengthwise toast them and butter the inside. Add cheese if desired.
7. Remove meat slices (I find kitchen tongs to be helpful for this) from the crock pot and pile meat onto the hoagie rolls.
8. With a ladle get some juice from the crock pot and put it into a small bowl to serve with the sandwiches (au jus - to dip the sandwich into).
9. Helpful hint: To thicken the au jus pour it into a saucepan on the stove and bring to a boil. Mix 3 tablespoons of cornstarch with 1/2 cup of cold water in a separate cup (make sure it is mixed completely) and gradually pour the mixture into boiling au jus. You probably won't need it all and the longer it boils the thicker it will become too.,

instructions, 1. Mix the condensed milk with the water in a bowl.
2. In a large bowl pour the flour and add salt sugar baking powder and soft unsalted butter.
3. Use your finger to rub the butter into the flour mix. Keep rubbing until it looks like cornmeal. It take around 5 minutes.
4. Add the condensed milk mixture and blend well to create a ‘ball’.
5. Transfer the dough into plastic wrap.
6. Refrigerate for 20 minutes. Do not leave it longer or the dough will become really hard and it will be impossible to roll out.
7. Preheat the oven at 200°C.
8. Remove the dough from the fridge and divide the dough in small balls (size of a walnut).
9. Roll each ball into a 20 cm long stick with the thickness of a chopstick. Make sure that all your stick have similar size. If you have 2 different size cook them on separated baking sheet. Large stick required a longer cooking time.
10. Transfer your stick into a baking sheet.
11. Cook for 8-10 minutes at 200°C or until the stick are golden brown.
12. Let them cool for at least 2 hours before covering them with chocolate. I usually leave them 12 hours but you do not have too wait so long.
13. First you have to prepare a stick holder. It is where the covered stick biscuit will stand to cool down. I took an empty box of nappies (of course you can use any other packaging shoes box eggs cages pizza box etc) and I drilled holes with a scissors.
14. Melt chocolate in the microwave. The best way to do not overcooked the chocolate is to melt it 30 seconds then mix well with a teaspoon. Start again until the chocolate is melted shiny and not too warm (you should be able to dip a finger inside without burning you).  It took 2 minutes with my microwave but it depends on yours.
15. Use a pastry brush. Dip the brush in the melted chocolate and cover ¾ of the stick biscuit.
16. Keep the stick few seconds head down to let the extra chocolate to flow.
17. Twist if it is it flowing and stand on the cake stand.
18. Repeat for each stick.
19. The thickness of chocolate depends on taste. The original recipe contain only a thin layer of chocolate.
20. At this stage you could be creative and add some sprinkles on the chocolate.
21. Leave them on the stick stand for 3 hours at room temperature. Do not put them in the fridge or the dark chocolate will turn white.,

instructions, 1. Slice the onions into rings and saute in butter in a skillet until tender.
2. Turn crock pot on to low and put in the cans of beef broth bay leaves dash of garlic powder and salt and pepper 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and 3/4 cup of water. When the onions and butter mixture is tender then also add them to the crock pot.
3. Cover and cook for at least 3-5 hours on low. At this point you may want to taste the soup and see if you would like it a little weaker--if so add a little water or chicken broth. Also at this time remove the bay leaves and discard them.
4. When about ready to serve slice bread into thin slices and toast in oven on 350°F or in toaster oven until just crusty. Put toasted slices (1-3) in bowl and cover with the cheese (adjust cheese to your liking). Then cover bread and cheese with hot soup. The cheese will melt and the bread will rise to the top.,

instructions, 1. Whisk together first 4 ingredients until sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth.  Pour the mixture evenly into 5 (5"x1") round ramekins or custard cups.  Place cups in a large roasting pan or a 15x10" jellyroll pan.  Add hot water to pan to a depth of 1/2 inch.  (Tip:  All baking times are for 5"x1" round baking dishes.  Adjust baking time more or less according to your cup size.  See test for doneness in next paragraph.)  As a general rule 4 oz. cups yield 10 servings 6 oz. cups yield 7 servings and 8 oz. cups yield 5 servings.).
2. Bake at 300 degrees for 40 - 50 minutes or until almost set.  Cool custards in water in pan on a wire rack.  Carefully remove from pan; cover and chill 8 hours. (Tip:  Baking times may need to be adjusted according to size of the baking cups.  The creme brulee is done when the center is slightly liquid and a knife will NOT come out clean.).
3. Sprinkle about 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar over each custard then place custards in a jellyroll pan.
4. Broil 5 1/2 inches from heat (if using an electric oven leave door partially open) until sugar melts.  (Tip:  When you broil the brown sugar get the creme brulee as close to the heating element as possible.  You may need to place an inverted roasting pan on the top shelf of the oven; then place the brulee on a baking sheet on top to elevate.  A chef's secret is to nestle the custards in a pan filled with ice; then broil.  The ice keeps the custards cold while the sugar melts.)  Let stand 5 minutes to allow sugar to harden.

instructions, 1. Trim a thin slice from each side of the long axis of each potato. Once each potato is "squared" slice it into 1/4-inch planks and then cut each plank into 1/4-inch fries.  Rinse cut potatoes in large bowl under cold running water until water turns clear. Cover with cold water and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 12 hours.
2. Pour off water spread potatoes onto kitchen towels and thoroughly dry. Transfer potatoes to large bowl and toss with cornstarch until evenly coated. Transfer potatoes to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and let rest until fine white coating forms about 20 minutes.
3. Meanwhile in heavy-bottomed 7 qt Dutch oven fitted with clip-on-the-pot candy thermometer heat peanut oil over medium heat to 325 degrees F.
4. Add half of potatoes a handful at a time to hot oil and increase heat to high. Fry stirring until potatoes start to turn from white to blond 4 to 5 minutes. (Oil temperature will drop about 75 degrees during this frying.)
5. Transfer fries to thick paper bag or paper towels. Return oil to 325 degrees F and repeat with remaining potatoes. Reduce heat to medium and let fries cool while cooking steaks at least 10 minutes.
6. Combine all herb butter ingredients in medium bowl. Set aside. Heat vegetable oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until smoking.
7. Meanwhile cut your steaks in half. If your steaks are 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 inches thick cut them in half vertically into small thick steaks. If your steaks are thicker than 1 3/4 inches cut them in half horizontally into two thinner steaks.
8. Next season steaks with salt and pepper. Lay steaks in pan leaving 1/4 inch between them. Cook not moving steaks until well browned about 4 minutes.
9. Using tongs flip steaks and continue to cook until instant-read thermometer inserted in center registers 120 degrees F for rare to medium-rare 3 to 7 minutes. Transfer steaks to large plate top with butter and tent loosely with foil; let rest while finishing fries.
10. Increase heat under Dutch oven to high and heat oil to 375 degrees. Add half of fries a handful at a time and fry until golden brown and puffed 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a thick unopened paper bag or paper towels. Return oil to 375 degrees F and repeat with remaining fries. Season fries with salt and serve immediately with steaks.,

instructions, 1. You will need a heavy skillet with a diameter or 9 to 10 inches (Dorie uses a cast-iron skillet; smaller is better than larger).
2. Choose a skillet with a handle that can go under the broiler (if you are not sure wrap the handle in foil).
3. Pour about 2 tablespoons oil into the skillet and warm it over medium heat.
4. Add the potatoes and onion garlic and rosemary if using; turn the ingredients around until they glisten with oil.
5. Season with salt and pepper; decrease the heat and cook slowly until the potatoes are golden and cooked through about 20 minutes; you should be able to pierce the potatoes easily with the tip of a knife.
6. Discard the garlic and rosemary and transfer the potatoes and onion to a bowl.
7. Carefully wipe the skillet with a paper towel (if anything has stuck to the bottom of the pan you should wash it--you need a clean surface so the tortilla will unmold easily).
8. Position broiler rack so that when you slide the skillet onto it the pan will be about 6 inches from the heat source; preheat broiler.
9. In a big bowl beat the eggs with salt and pepper to taste and the cayenne then stir in the potatoes and onion.
10. Put the skillet over med-high heat and pour in about 1 1/2 tablespoons oil.
11. When the oil is hot add the eggs and potatoes to the pan.
12. Immediately lower the heat and let the eggs cook undisturbed for about 2 minutes.
13. Run a silicone spatula or a table knife around the edges of the pan to release the tortilla then cover the pan and cook slowly for another 8-10 minutes or until the top is almost set--there will be a circle of liquid or jiggly egg at the center.
14. Every couple of minutes run your spatula around the sides of the pan and just under the tortilla to keep it from sticking.
15. Slide the pan under the broiler and cook until the top of the tortilla is set; check it after 1 minute and then keep checking--it can go fast.
16. Transfer the tortilla to a serving platter and allow it to cool to room temperature before cutting and serving it.,

Add the wine bring to a boil reduce the heat and simmer until the wine has evaporated and the onions are dry about 5 minutes. Discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Dust the onions with the flour and give them a stir. Turn the heat down to medium low so the flour doesn't burn and cook for 10 minutes to cook out the raw flour taste. Now add the beef broth bring the soup back to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
2. When you're ready to eat preheat the broiler. Arrange the baguette slices on a baking sheet in a single layer. Sprinkle the slices with the Gruyere and broil until bubbly and golden brown 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Ladle the soup in bowls and float several of the Gruyere croutons on top.
4. Alternative method: Ladle the soup into bowls top each with 2 slices of bread and top with cheese. Put the bowls into the oven to toast the bread and melt the cheese.
5. NOTE:  The amount of cheese depends on your personal taste.  We sometimes use more if we want it more cheesy.  I've also used a combination of cheeses (but NEVER Velveeta).  The best I find is a combination of gruyere Swiss combined with a small amount of Parmesan.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 250 degrees.  Heat oil in deep fryer to 375 degrees.  You could use a heavy pot on the stove top with about 2 inches of oil in it.  You want the beans to float and not be crowded.
2. Wash the greenbeans and dry them well.  Snip the ends but leave them full length.
3. Prepare pancake mix per instructions on the box.  You will need about 3 cups of the mixture.
4. Dip the greenbeans in the batter mixture and put them in the hot oil.  Put them in one at a time so they don't "glue" together but you can do quite a few at a time.  Cook them until they are golden brown.
5. Remove cooked beans from oil and drain on paper towels.  While they are still hot sprinkle them with the parmesan cheese.
6. Place the beans on a cookie sheet in the preheated oven while you cook the remaining beans.  Try not to leave them in the oven for too long as the batter will start to get soft.  Usually mine don't make it to the oven because they get eaten before they get that far.,

8. The amount of egg mixture absorbed when making French toast depends upon the bread being used. Soft bread with an open porous texture will absorb more liquid and absorb it more quickly than drier bread with a fine texture Once you've dipped the first 1 or 2 slices you can determine how long to keep the bread in the egg mixture so you don't run out of the egg mixture.,

instructions, 1. Position a rack in the center of the oven.
2. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
3. Bring the milk and butter to a simmer in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan over medium heat stirring constantly to be sure the butter is completely melted by the time the milk simmers.

5. Decrease heat to low.
6. Stir constantly until the paste comes together into a ball and films the bottom of the saucepan about 1 minute.
7. Adjust the heat as necessary so the paste cooks without burning.
8. The idea here is to force off excess moisture in the form of steam from the paste in order to make a crisper pastry; remove the saucepan from the heat.
9. Whisk 4 of the eggs in a bowl to combine them.
10. One-fourth at a time stir the beaten eggs into the hot dough in the saucepan and stir well until the dough comes together into a glossy mass.
11. Stir in the Gruyere rosemary mustard salt and pepper.

15. Beat the remaining egg well with a pinch of salt.
16. Lightly brush some of the egg glaze on the mounds of dough being sure that the egg does no drip down onto the sheet.
17. Bake until the balls are puffed and golden brown 20-25 minutes.
18. If the gougeres have not baked long enough they will deflate when taken from the oven so bake for at least 20 minutes before checking them.
19. Remove the sheet from the oven.
20. Pierce each gougere with the tip of a small knife (this releases the steam from the interiors of the puffs and helps crisp them).
21. Return to the oven and continue baking until the gougeres are crisp 5-8 minutes.

instructions, 1. Warm and melt the honey by standing the jar in a pan of hot water measure it into the rye flour in a bowl and mix together with a wooden spoon. Leave covered for 1 hour for the flour to absorb all the liquid.
2. Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Add the rest of the ingredients except the glaze and mix with vigour to ensure everything is spread evenly through the dough - this will be very sticky! Knead the dough on a clean work surface for between 5-10 minutes You can dip hands into a bowl of water at intervals to help with the kneading if necessary.
3. Press the dough mixture intpo a well greased 2lb loaf tin. Make sure it's pushed right into the corners.
4. Bake the loaf on the middle shelf for about 35 mins until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. When you have removed it from the oven brush with glaze and return to oven for a couple of minutes to set the glaze.
5. Let the bread stand in the tin for a few minutes then invert onto a wire rack. This keeps very well and because it's made using rye it can be better for being left a couple of days before eating. (We never let it wait long though !).,

4. 4.  Add the gelatin ginger marmalade and vanilla stirring to blend the mixture well.  Transfer it to a mixing bowl and chill it until it just begins to set (perhaps an hour--watch closely. If you wait too long it will coagulate into lumps and be ruined).

instructions, 1. 1/2  cup           chestnut puree Preheat the oven to 3750F.
2. Li ne a 17 x 11 x 1-inch jelly roll pan with parchment paper.
3. Brush it with melted butter and dust it with flour.
4. Prepare the cake: Sift the flour baking powder and salt together onto a sheet of parchment paper.
5. Beat the egg yolks and 3/4 cup of the sugar with the whisk attachment in an electric mixer until the mixture is thick and lemon colored.
6. Add the dry ingredients at low speed mixing until just incorporated.
7. Add the vanilla mix quickly and thoroughly and set aside (the batter will be quite thick). In a separate bowl whisk the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they form soft points.
8. Add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and whisk until the egg whites are glossy and form points that stand up but are not too stiff.
9. Fold  one-fourth of the egg whites into the cake batter until they are incorporated then fold in the remaining egg whites working quickly.
10. They should be incorporated into the  batter but do not overmix it. Spread the batter in the prepared pan and bake until the c ake is golden and your finger makes a slight indentation in the top of the cake when you press it 8 to 10  minutes.
11. While the cake is baking sift the confectioner's sugar over a clean kitchen towel.
12. Remove the cake from the oven and immediately invert it onto the sugar-dusted towel.
13. Peel the parchment paper from the cake and starting from one long side gently roll the cake up in the towel.
14. Allow it to cool for 30 minutes.
15. Make the frosting: Melt the chocolate and the cream together in a medium-sized heavy saucepan over medium heat. Shake the pan occasionally and when the chocolate has completely melted whisk the mixture so it is completely combined.
16. Let it cool to room temperature so it is thick enough to spread.
17. Transfer 3/4 cup of the chocolate mixture to a small bowl and whisk in the chestnut puree. Season with vanilla if you like. When the cake has cooled unroll it and trim off the edges so it is perfectly even reserving the trimmings.
18. Spread the filling evenly over the ca ke to within about 1/8-inch from the edges and roll the cake back up.
19. Roll the trimmings into spirals and affix these to the sides of the cake with any leftover filling (usually two "knots" are sufficient!). Using the frosting generously frost the cake including the knots and the ends.
20. Let the cake rest for about 15 minutes then decorate it first with the tines of a fork then with the decorations of your choice. Let sit for at least 8 hours and up to 24 before servings.
21. NOTES : This is a simple recipe for a wonderful buche de Noel.
22. The cake is a bit heartier than the typical genoise which suits my taste and the hint of  cinnamon gives it an aromatic layer of flavor.
23. You may change and adjust  flavorings drizzle the cake with a rum or a sugar syrup flavored with vanilla  after it's cooled or do any number of things to make it your own.,

Serve by spoonful; there wasn't any chance that I was going to get this out of the pan in nice neat squares.  Serve with honey butter maple syrup or nothing -- it's quite sweet and the apples create a lovely topping.,

instructions, 1. Preheat frying oil to 365 degrees if not in a deep fryer make sure you have enough oil to float the toast.
2. Combine dry ingredients (without granola) in a mixing bowl.
3. Add milk egg and vanilla to the dry ingredients bowl and whisk until well blended.
4. If your mixing bowl is not flat enough to allow proper dipping of the toast pieces transfer your mix to a pie pan or other flat bottom dish.
5. Place granola on a plate or other dish to make coating toast easier.
6. Using a bread or serrated knife slice each toast piece in half diagonally.  Press lightly and let the knife do the work to avoid squishing the bread.
7. Dip the toast in the batter mix flipping to coat both sides.  Depending on preference you can let some batter drip off or whip off on edge of dish before next step but be sure to leave enough to coat the surface and pick up the granola.
8. The goal of this step is to pick up just a little granola.  Place the battered toast on the bed of granola press lightly.  Flip and press lightly again.  You can also sprinkle the granola on or spread it out with your fingers for an even coating.
9. Place prepared toast in fryer basket and when basket is full (mine allows 4 pieces) place in fryer oil.  You could add one piece at a time just personal preference here.  Do not overlap or stack leave room this is not like frying fries.  You need room for these to float in the oil and for the oil to cook the edges.
10. Allow bread piece to cook 2-3 minutes or until golden brown (on the side in the oil).  Flip and cook on the other side for an additional 2-3 minutes.
11. Remove toast from frying and place on a plate covered with a paper towel.  Optionally sprinkle with powdered sugar while still fresh from the fryer.
12. Continue battering coating and frying until all pieces are done.
13. Also when serving you can drizzle in syrup.,

instructions, 1. Lay the pork on a large chopping board and cover with cling film. With a rolling pin mallet or other suitable blunt object pound the meat as close to an even 1" thickness that you can manage.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a frying pan over a medium high. Add all of the chopped onion half the minced garlic half the fennel seeds all of the rosemary and bay half of the ground cloves salt and pepper and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until all the fragrance has been released from the herbs and spices. Transfer to a plate to cool.
3. Spread and rub this mixture over and into the pork then roll the meat up as tightly and neatly as you can. Tie with kitchen string at intervals.
4. Mix the remaining ingredients (minced garlic fennel seeds ground cloves olive oil) and rub it over the outside of the pork. Cover it with cling film and refrigerate 24 hours or at least overnight.
5. Remove the meat 40 minutes before cooking to allow it to return to room temperature. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 150C/300F Take the cling film off the pork and place the pork joint in to a roasting tin.
6. Cook the pork for 4 hours to 5 hours until it is falling apart when you test it with a knife or fork. If the spices on the surface start to char too badly (a little blackness is a good thing) tent foil loosely over the roast. (I find I need to cover it for the last hour of cooking.).
7. CROCK POT - at this stage cook the pork in a crock pot for 4 to 5 hours on high or on automatic for up to 8 hours.
8. Remove from the oven and leave to rest at least 30 minutes to one hour. Slice pull or shred the meat and serve in warmed ciabatta rolls.,

instructions, 1. The night before baking make the poolish by mixing together 1 cup of flour 1 cup of water and 1/2 teaspoon of yeast to make a batter.
2. Cover the container with plastic wrap and set aside for 8 to 16 hours.
3. Next Day:
4. In large bowl combine the remaining flour with the remaining yeast salt and herbs.
5. Add the poolish the liqueur and 1/4 cup of the additional water.
6. Mix the ingredients and if necessary add more water or flour until the proper consistency is reached (tacky but not so sticky that the dough sticks to your hands).
7. Knead by hand for 10 to 15 minutes or in a mixer for 5 to 10 minutes.
8. Place the dough in a well-greased bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap.
9. Set aside to rise until doubled in size approximately 90 minutes. Remove it from the bowl and gently degas it then return it to the bowl cover it and allow it to double in size again.
10. Remove the dough from the bowl and shape it into a ball or long loaf.
11. Cover the loaf with a damp towel and allow it to rise again until doubled in size which takes between 60 and 90 more minutes.
12. While the loaf is in its final rise preheat the oven and baking stone if you are using one to 450.
13. I also preheat a broiler pan or cast iron skillet into which to pour a cup of hot water just after placing the loaf in the oven. This creates steam in the oven which increases the crunchiness of the crust.
14. Just prior to placing the loaf in the oven score the top of it with a sharp knife or razor blade.
15. Place the loaf in the oven and bake for 20 minutes at 450 then rotate it 180 degrees and reduce the oven temperature to 375 and baked it another 25 minutes.
16. The internal temperature of the loaf should be approximately 200 degrees when you remove it from the oven.,

2. Melt chocolate in the microwave for 30 sec on HIGH stir.
3. Repeat the zapping and stirring until chocolate mixture is smooth and completely melted.
4. Stir in brandy (or other liquor) if using and set aside.
5. In a medium heatproof bowl whisk eggs with the 3 TB water and sugar until well-blended.
6. Set bowl in a skillet of barely simmering water stirring constantly cook egg mixture until it registers 160°F on instant-read thermometer (remove bowl from the skillet to check temp).
7. Once the temp has been reached remove bowl from skillet and beat with an electric mixer at high speed for at least 3-4mins until eggs have a texture similar to softly whipped cream.
8. Fold about 1/4 of the egg mixture into the melted chocolate.
9. Scrape the lightened chocolate mixture into the remaining beaten eggs and fold gently until evenly incorporated.
10. If egg safety is not an issue omit the heating step- whip the eggs with the sugar (omit the water as it's added just to prevent eggs from scrambling) and proceed accordingly.
11. Now you may divide mousse into individual ramekins or glasses chill for at least 1 hour until set; cover with plastic wrap if you're not serving within a few hours.
12. You may also use the mousse as a cake filling- I've done this with success using a cake ring (or a springform pan).
13. If you're using very high percentage chocolate (70% and above) you may want to increase sugar to 4 1/2 TB.,

instructions, 1. With a whisk beat eggs till well mixed and then start to add the flour.  Add enough to thicken the batter to the consistency of a thick cake batter (or brownie batter).
2. Then slowly start to mix in the milk.  Add enough milk to thin the batter out to the consistency of half and half.  Add salt and for sweet crepes the sugar and vanilla.  Mix.
3. Heat a 9 inch nonstick pan over med. to med/high heat.  Spray with non stick spray or grease with a small drop of butter.
4. Using a small ladle or a 1/3 measuring cup lift pan off stove and pour measured batter in quickly swirling the batter to coat the pan.  Keep swirling the pan till all the batter has solidified.  Return to heat.
5. Cook approximately 1- 2 minutes.  You can flip and cook other side for another 45 sec. or just remove to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter.
6. Fill with whatever you would like.  My personal favorite is after flipping the crepe I break an egg on the crepe and quickly scramble it and spread it out over the crepe being careful not to tear the crepe.  Add salt and pepper then a slice of ham and a bit of cheese.  Wait a minute for the egg to cook and the cheese to melt and then fold in half and half again.  Oh so good!  My kids love sugar and cinnamon or jam my husband loves lemon and sugar.  And lets not forget nutella with bananas and toasted almonds.,

instructions, 1. Blanch bacon with 1 cup of water in a nonstick pan to render and give off enough fat to fry with. Remove bacon into a bowl and set aside.

Stir in the tomatoes and added the herb bouquet. Bring to a simmer and covered. Regulate heat so that liquid simmer very slowly for 4 hours or until the meat is tender and sauce has reduced. It is worth checking the meat every hour and if the level of liquid drops gradually add half a cup each of the beef stock and red wine.
5. When the stew is done prepare the shallots and mushrooms. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil and stir in 2 tablespoons of butter in a skillet add shallots and sauté over moderate heat gently rolling them till brown evenly. Then add 1 cup of the stock left salt and pepper and the same herb bouquet used in the stew. Cover and simmer slowly until the shallots are tender and the liquid evaporates. Then remove the herb bouquet and set the shallots aside.
6. In the same skillet heat remaining oil and butter over high heat and add the mushrooms tossing them till brown slightly. Then remove from heat. Set the mushrooms aside until needed.
7. Pour the contents of the casserole into a sieve set over a saucepan. Simmer the sauce for 2 minutes in the saucepan allowing the sauce to reduce gently to give a rich finish to this dish. Season carefully with salt and pepper.
8. Wash out the casserole and put back to heat and return the meat and vegetables. Pour sauce over the meat and vegetables into the casserole. Add in the shallots and mushrooms. Cover and simmer for another 2 minutes gently basting the meat and vegetables with the sauce several times.
9. Serve hot in a casserole or arrange on a stew platter over mashed potatoes or favorite cooked pasta and garnish with parsley.,

instructions, 1. MIXING: Using an electric mixer with the flat beater (or by hand but you'll be exhausted) add 3 cups of flour to the bowl and mix in the 2.5 cups water and the yeast. Add up to 1 more cup flour to make a dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Mix for 9 minutes. Monitor the dough to make sure that it does not creep up the sides of the bowl and onto the motor. Push it down with a spatula if required.
2. While dough is being worked dissolve salt and water. Add at the end of the 9 minutes and mix 1 more minute.
3. KNEAD: Switch to the dough hook for the mixer and knead for another 10 minutes. Add the remaining flour a little at a time until dough pulls cleanly away from the sides of the bowl.
4. FIRST RISING: Put dough into a greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for 2 hours. The dough should double or triple in volume.
5. KNEAD: Gently remove dough from bowl and place onto a work surface. Knead by hand for 3 minutes.
6. SECOND RISING: Put dough back into bowl and re-cover. Allow to rise 1.5 hours (dough should double or triple).
7. SHAPING: Flour a work surface and gently remove dough from bowl onto the work surface. Punch down the dough and cut into 4 pieces. Allow dough to rest 5 minutes. Shape 4 pieces into baguettes or rounds. Place the shaped dough on a greased baking sheet (depending on the size of your baking sheet you may need to use 2 of them).
8. THIRD RISING: Once shaped dough is on baking sheet cover with cloth or paper towel and allow to rise for 1 hour. Dough should double in size.
9. BAKING: Place an empty broiler pan on the floor of the oven. Then preheat oven to 450°F Once oven is preheated add 1 cup hot water to the broiler pan to develop steam in the oven (be careful you don't burn yourself on the initial burst of steam) and wait 5 minutes.
10. Place baking sheet(s) in the oven and bake 20-30 minutes. I use a convection oven so I do not need to rotate during baking. Keep an eye on the bread to make sure it is cooking evenly if you have an oven with hot spots.
11. The loaves should be golden-brown and should sound hard and hollow when tapped on the bottom.
12. Remove loaves from pan and let them cool until you can handle them without burning yourself then slice and enjoy!,

2. Just take container out of the freezer when you want to make up garlic bread. By the time you slice the bread it will be ready to spread depending on what spread you use.  Butter will take a little longer but whatever spread you use it can safely be re-frozen.
3. To make up:  I like to slice my French loaf diagonally and not too thick If using rolls I cut in half lengthways.
4. Spread quite thickly over the entire surface and bake at 150degC (300degF) on baking paper lined tray for about 10 - 15minutes until starting to brown & bubble on top. The bottom will still be reasonably soft and the top toasty.,

instructions, 1. Clean the shrimps by rinsing well under a cold tap. Use a sieve or colander for this. Shake off excess water.
2. Clean further by cutting down the back with any scissors. Remove the blackish vein if any: is easiest to use kitchen paper to work on and scrape the vein on to that. Discard the paper when finished.
3. Peel the shrimps and carefully pull off the skins and the head and put in a separate bowl. Do NOT press out the gunk in the head. It won't kill you and will add to the flavour of your stock. You want all the peels and the heads.
4. Cover and keep the cleaned shrimps to cook later.
5. Put the water lemon juice and shrimp/prawn peels and heads into a large heavy-bottomed pot.
6. Add the prepared carrots onion potatoes and tomatoes and stir through.
7. Bring to the boil.
8. When the stock comes to a rolling boil turn down the heat put on the lid and simmer for about 20 minutes.
9. Add the sugar Thai fish sauce parsley garlic and pepper sauce. Stir and let simmer another 10 minutes.
10. *Please note that I did not measure everything carefully. I was trying to imitate a recipe so I guessed some quantities. I might have used more fish sauce than stated and also more sugar. I used local piquanté pepper chutney instead of a hot pepper sauce. So there might be little differences between your results and mine. DO taste  --  the fun of cooking lies in experimenting!
11. Using a very fine sieve strain the whole pot into a bowl. Don't let any shrimp peels fall into the stock.
12. You will have about 3 cups of stock or more.
13. Now add back into the stock the potato chunks (or as much as you can as some would have disintegrated) and the carrot chunks.
14. Taste it: it will need more salt or a seasoning salt of your choice.
15. Put it in a processor or blender and blend until the vegetables have slightly thickened the sauce. Add the cream and whizz again.
16. Use only the amount of sauce you plan to use for your dish i.e. 1 cup for pasta for six people. Cool and freeze the rest for another day.
17. Taste again to see whether you'd like to add more salt or maybe even a little (real tomato) ketchup or pepper sauce.
18. I haven't yet attempted that fish terrine but the sauce was great over fettucine with the shrimps which were simply fried in olive oil with seasoning.
19. Add a green salad of mixed small leaves -- mesclun as the French say. And don't forget the chilled white wine: a sauvignon blanc ought to do it -- .,

7. After pouring marshmallow mixture into pan take another piece of plastic wrap lightly oiled on the side which you will be placing on top of the marshmallow mixture and lightly press marshmallow mixture till flat and even into the pan.
8. Let marshmallows sit up for about 2 hours (I have had luck with 1 1/2 hours).  Remove from pan dredge whole slab with confectioners’ sugar and cut into squares.

6. Line a baking sheet with parchment.
7. Spoon the mixture into mounds (about 2 teaspoons each).
8. Refrigerate 15 minutes or until firm.
9. Use the cornstarch to dust your hands and roll the mixture into balls.
10. Refrigerate overnight.
11. Remove centers from the refrigerator to warm to room temperature before the next steps.
12. Melt 1 1/2 pounds of chopped chocolate and temper as follows.
13. If the chocolate is dull grainy or blemished heat to at least 115 degrees.
14. When the chocolate is nearly melted stir to complete the melt.
15. Let the chocolate cool to 100 degrees.
16. Look at the chunk of solid chocolate- it should be smooth dark and glossy without dullness or streaking.
17. Submerge the 6 ounces of solid chocolate in the melted chocolate and stir until the chocolate cools to 90 degrees.
18. What this process does is isomerize the chocolate as it cools so that the cooled shells will stay glossy and smooth even in the refrigerator.
19. If the solid chunk is dull streaky or grained it will have the opposite effect.
20. The taste will be the same but tempering the chocolate makes the truffles much more attractive.
21. When the chocolate has cooled to 90 degrees remove the chunk and save it for the next time you temper chocolate.
22. Smear a thin sample of the melted chocolate on wax paper and refrigerate for 2 minutes.
23. The smear should cool glossy and smooth and should break with a snap.
24. Dip each truffle in chocolate; two forks seem to work the best for this (although I'd be interested in hearing anyone else's idea).
25. Top the truffles with cocoa or nuts if desired; if you plan to do this do each truffle as you dip them because they solidify fairly quickly.
26. Refrigerate until set.,

instructions, 1. For crust: Roll out the dough 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured surface turning it constantly so that it does not stick; add more flour as needed (the dough might crack around the edges most of the cracks don't matter since the edges will be trimmed after the tart is in the pan if there are some big ones that will show when the tart is in the pan patch them with pieces of dough before fitting the) when the dough is rolled out flip it over the rolling pin and transfer it to a 10-inch tart pan with removable bottom; fit it into the tart pan without stretching; roll the rolling pin over the top of the tart to cut off the dough hanging over the pan's edge; refrigerate 20 minutes.
2. Preheat oven to 400°F Place the tart pan on shallow baking sheet; fit the tart pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper fill with beans or pie weights and bake in the middle of preheated oven for 15 minutes; carefully remove the foil with beans and bake for another 5 minutes.
3. For filling: Turn the heat down to 375F; quarter core and peel the apples; cut into 1/4" lengthwise slices; toss them in a bowl with the sugar and cinnamon then arrange them in the crust in concentric circles; bake in the upper third of preheated oven for about 20 minutes or until they start to color and are almost tender; remove from oven and let cool while preparing the custard.
4. For custard: Beat the egg and sugar together in a mixing bowl until mixture is thick pale yellow and falls back on itself forming a slowly dissolving ribbon; beat in the flour then the cream and finally the cognac; pour the mixture over the apples; it should come almost to the top of the pastry shell; return to oven for 10 minutes or until cream begins to puff.
5. Sprinkle with icing sugar (placed in a sieve and sprinkled evenly over) and return to oven for 15 to 20 minutes more.
6. Tart is done when top has browned and a knife plunged into the custard comes out clean; unmold the tart; cool 10 minutes and serve.,

instructions, 1. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in medium saucepan over low heat. Remove from heat and immediately stir in milk (temperature should be lower than 90 degrees). Whisk in yeast; transfer milk mixture to bowl of stand mixer. Add flour sugar and 2 teaspoons salt. Using dough hook knead on low speed until cohesive dough forms 2 to 3 minutes. Increase speed to medium-low and knead for 1 minute. Remove bowl from mixer and cover with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at room temperature 30 minutes.
2. Transfer dough to parchment paper–lined rimmed baking sheet and shape into 10 by 7-inch rectangle about 1 inch thick. Wrap tightly with plastic and refrigerate for 2 hours.
3. BUTTER BLOCK: While dough chills fold 24-inch length of parchment in half to create 12-inch rectangle. Fold over 3 open sides of rectangle to form 8-inch square with enclosed sides. Crease folds firmly. Place 24 tablespoons cold butter directly on counter and beat with rolling pin for about 60 seconds until butter is just pliable but not warm then fold butter in on itself using bench scraper. Beat into rough 6-inch square. Unfold parchment envelope. Using bench scraper transfer butter to center of parchment refolding at creases to enclose. Turn packet over so that flaps are underneath and gently roll until butter fills parchment square taking care to achieve even thickness. Refrigerate at least 45 minutes.
4. LAMINATE: Transfer dough to freezer. After 30 minutes transfer to lightly floured counter and roll into 17 by 8-inch rectangle with long side parallel to edge of counter. Unwrap butter and place in center of dough. Fold sides of dough over butter so they meet in center. Press seam together with fingertips. With rolling pin press firmly on each open end of packet. Roll out lengthwise into 24 by 8-inch rectangle. Starting at bottom of dough fold into thirds like business letter into 8-inch square. Turn dough 90 degrees counterclockwise. Roll out lengthwise again into 24 by 8-inch rectangle and fold into thirds. Place dough on sheet wrap tightly with plastic and return to freezer for 30 minutes.
5. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter so that top flap opens on right. Roll out dough lengthwise into 24 by 8-inch rectangle and fold into thirds. Place dough on sheet wrap tightly with plastic and refrigerate for 2 hours or up to 24 hours.
6. SHAPE: Transfer dough to freezer. After 30 minutes transfer to lightly floured counter and roll into 18 by 16-inch rectangle with long side of rectangle parallel to edge of counter. Fold upper half of dough over lower half. Using ruler mark dough at 3-inch intervals along bottom edge with bench scraper (you should have 5 marks). Move ruler to top edge of dough measure in 11/2 inches from left then use this mark to measure out 3-inch intervals (you should have 6 marks). Starting at lower left corner use sharp pizza wheel or knife to cut dough from mark to mark. You will have 12 triangles and 5 diamonds; discard scraps. Unfold diamonds and cut into 10 triangles (making 22 equal-size triangles in total).
7. Position 1 triangle on counter. (Keep remaining triangles covered with plastic.) Cut 1/2-inch slit in center of short side of triangle. Grasp triangle by 2 corners on either side of slit and stretch gently then stretch bottom point. Place triangle on counter so point is facing you. Fold down both sides of slit. Roll top of triangle partway toward point. Gently grasp point with 1 hand and stretch again. Resume rolling tucking point underneath. Curve ends gently toward each other to create crescent. Repeat with remaining triangles.
8. Place 12 croissants on 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets at least 21/2 inches apart. Lightly wrap with plastic. Let stand at room temperature until nearly doubled in size 21/2 to 3 hours. (Shaped croissants can be refrigerated for up to 18 hours. Remove from refrigerator to rise and add at least 30 minutes to rising time.).
9. After croissants have been rising for 2 hours adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 425 degrees. In small bowl whisk together egg water and pinch salt. Brush croissants with egg wash. Place croissants in oven and reduce temperature to 400 degrees. Bake for 12 minutes then switch and rotate baking sheets. Continue to bake until deep golden brown 8 to 12 minutes longer. Transfer to wire rack and cool about 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 425. Using your favorite pastry recipe for 9 inch pie or one that has been commercially prepared line a 10 inch tart pan with pie crust molding to sides of pan.  Prick bottom and sides with a fork and bake in preheated oven for 10 - 12 minutes.
2. Prepare poached pears:  Place pears wine sugar and cloves in a large skillet.  Bring to boil then simmer pears uncovered until they are crisp - tender.  Depending on the ripeness of your pears this can take 10 - 15 minutes or even up to 45 minutes.  Remove the pears with a slotted spoon and continue to reduce the poaching liquid to 1/3 cup creating a thick syrup.  Discard the cloves.  Bosc pears would probably work nicely too.  But the D'Anjou pear supposedly is not the best pear to cook with even though it is delicious on its own.
3. Prepare custard:  Simmer Half & Half in a small sauce pan.  In a bowl whisk together egg yolks flour and brown sugar until smooth.  Temper the egg yolk mixture by pouring some of the simmering Half & Half into it then whisk mixture back into simmering cream.  Bring to a boil over medium heat stirring constantly.  Reduce heat to simmer and continue stirring constantly until custard is thick and smooth a few minutes more.  Pour hot custard into a clean bowl and whisk in the almond extract butter and the syrup that was created from the reduced poaching liquid.
4. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Spread the custard evenly in the partially baked crust.  Using a large kitchen knife slice pear halves thinly about 1/8 inch and carefully fan out keeping shape of pear intact.  Using the knife scoop fanned-out pear half up and gently slide onto custard keeping the shape intact.  (Chef Sarah uses a method of slicing the pear half ALMOST to the bottom but leaving it intact transferring it to the custard and then fanning the pear out.  But this didn't work for me.)  Repeat until the crust is filled with thinly sliced pears.  If your pears are smaller you will need to place a pear half in the center.
5. Bake for 30 - 40 minutes until custard is set and lightly browned.
6. Melt a pat of butter in a small skillet and toast sliced almonds lightly.  Brush the warm tart with the melted apricot preserves to glaze then sprinkle with toasted almonds. In the original recipe the tart is topped with toasted chopped hazelnuts -- probably a better choice if using the hazelnut crust.  Serve tart warm or at room temperature topped with whipped cream.
7. *****************************************************************.
8. If you would like to prepare the hazelnut crust used in the original recipe:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Combine 1 cup of lightly toasted and skinned hazelnuts 1/4 cup of sugar 1 1/4 cups of four 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and pinch of salt in a food processor and mix thoroughly.  Add 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter and 1 large egg yolk and process until the dough forms a ball.  Press the dough over the bottom and up side of fluted tart pan.  Place shell in freezer for 15 minutes.  Prick the chilled tart shell on the bottom with a fork in several places.  Bake 12 - 15 minutes until just lightly browned.  Remove from oven and set aside to cool.  Proceed with recipe as above.  If using the hazelnut crust then top finished glazed tart with additional chopped hazelnuts.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Slice the top off the head of garlic place on a piece of foil sprinkle with salt and drizzle olive oil over top.  Roast about 30 minutes.  Once cool enough to handle squeeze the garlic into a small bowl and mash with a spoon into a paste.
2. Melt the butter in a pan and saute the onions over medium heat for about 45 minutes.  You want the onions to caramelize in their own sugars and take on a nice golden brown color.  This may take up to an hour depending on how dialed your heat is.  If they turn black it was too hot!
3. Season the chicken breasts with salt pepper and thyme on both sides.  Saute in olive oil over medium-high heat for about 2-3 minutes per side.  You only want a nice golden crust here.
4. Spread the roasted garlic paste over top of the chicken breasts and finish them in the 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes or until the juices run clear.  Let the chicken rest on your cutting board for 5 minutes while you prepare the sauce from the pan drippings.
5. Drain the excess olive oil from the pan and place over high heat.  Deglaze with chicken broth and the optional wine scraping the browned bits off the pan with a wooden spoon.  You want to boil this rapidly and reduce it down to about a third of what it was (or until it's a nice sauce consistency).  Taste and correct the seasoning with salt and pepper.
6. To plate slice the breasts diagonally lay the slices one atop the next drizzle with the sauce and top with the carmelized onions.,

2. To french the racks of lamb:
3. Make a cut on the fat side of the ribs perpendicular to them about 2 1/2-inches down from the rib ends. Cut through the fat down to the rib bones.
4. Turn the rack on end with the bones facing up and push a knife through the flesh between each rib using the initial cut as a guide for the knife. Cut down the side of each rib to remove the excess fat in between each rib. Using strong kitchen twine wrap the twine around each rib at the base nearest the meat and pull to remove all of the remaining fat and sinew from the rib bone.
5. Bend each rack into a semicircle (meat side in and fat side out) and using kitchen twine tie them together at the base and center in order to hold the racks together. The rib ends should be pushed outward to create the look of a crown.
6. Rub the lamb with the olive oil. Combine the salt pepper garlic thyme and coriander and press all over the lamb. Place the roast in a Bundt pan with the center of the pan coming up through the middle of the roast.
7. Place on the middle rack of the oven and cook for 30 to 35 minutes until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 130 degrees F. This is approximately 8 to 12 minutes per pound.
8. Remove from the oven transfer the roast to a rack cover with aluminum foil and let the meat rest for 20 minutes.
9. While the meat is resting add the lemon juice mustard and mint to the juices that accumulated in the Bundt pan while cooking.
10. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.
11. Cut the string away from the roast and place rice in the center.
12. Serve the warm sauce with the roast.,

instructions, 1. Peel the potatoes. In a large mixing bowl combine sugar corn syrup and hot water. Make sure the sugar is dissolved. Using a french fry slicer cut the peeled potatoes into shoestrings. The potatoes should be 1/4" x 1/4" in thickness and about 4" to 6" long. (You can do this with a knife but it is alot of work).
2. Place the shoestringed potatoes into the bowl of sugar-water and refrigerate. Let them soak about 30 minutes.
3. While they're soaking pack the shortening into the deep fryer. Crank up the temperature to "full". The shortening has to pre-heat for a very long time. It will eventually liquify. After it has liquified and is at least 375° drain the potatoes and dump them into the fryer. (be careful it will be ferocious).
4. After 1 to 1 1/2 minutes remove the potatoes and place them on a paper towel lined plate. Let them cool 8 to 10 minutes in the refrigerator.
5. While they're cooling add the lard or beef drippings to the hot Crisco®. Again crank the temperature to full. Stir in the lard as it melts into the oil. It will blend inches.
6. After the deep fryer is reheated to 375°-400° add the potatoes and deep fry again. This time for 5-7 minutes until golden brown. Remove and place in a large bowl.
7. Sprinkle generously with salt then "toss" the fries to mix the salt evenly.
8. Serve hot serve immediately and enjoy! Depending upon the size of the potatoes this recipe make about 2 medium sized fries.
9. Special Notes: If you want more fries double the recipe---but DON'T double the cooking oil. Just cook them in shifts adding about 1/4 cup more Crisco® and 1 tablespoon lard for the second batch.,

instructions, 1. Trim brisket to leave 1/4" of fat cap. Rub all surfaces - including the fat - with an equal mix of salt and pepper. Vacuum seal and refrigerate for at least an hour.
2. Fill up a large pot with water. Attach sous vide machine and raise the temperature to 155° F. Place the vacuum sealed brisket in the water. If desired cover the top with ping-pong balls (to retain the heat and keep the food from floating). Cook for 24 hours (don't rely on the timer on the machine!).
3. About an hour before the 24 hours is over render the chopped bacon in a large pot. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside for later.
4. Cook the pearl onions on medium heat in the rendered bacon fat for about 5 minutes rolling the pot to cook all sides and avoid burning. Add minced garlic and half of the thyme and cook for about 30 seconds scraping constantly to avoid burning. Remove from heat and set aside.
5. When the brisket is done in the sous vide cut open bag and retain the juices. Pat the brisket dry then reapply a salt and pepper rub.
6. Either use an offset smoker or a barbecue grill with one side turned off. Place a "boat" of wood chips in aluminum foil with the top open on the side with the flames. Place the brisket on the side without the flame. Check every 20 minutes or so and add additional wood chips to keep smoking consistently.
7. Place the mushrooms and carrot slices in a vacuum seal bag with the sherry olive oil the remaining thyme and a dash of salt and pepper. Vacuum seal the bag. Raise the sous vide temperature to 180° F then place the bag in the water. Cover with ping-pong balls and cook for 1 hour.
8. While this is happening return the pot with the onions to a medium heat and add the wine and the retained beef juices. Scrape the bottom of the pot if needed to blend in the leavings of the bacon and the sauteing. Lower heat to a simmer for 30 minutes with the top off (I added that last sentence after tasting too much residual alcohol from the wine the way I made it).
9. Remove the smoked brisket from the grill. Cut into chunks and add to the cook pot. Add finished mushrooms and carrots to the cook pot along with any juices from the bag. Cook for 20 minutes or until desired consistency is reached.
10. Serve with farro or other grain.,

instructions, 1. Measure all your ingredients before you start. Grease six 6-ounce ramekins with 1 tablespoon butter. Make sure you don't touch the inside surface once it's buttered or the souffles won't rise as well. Sprinkle the bottom of the ramekins with 1 teaspoon grated cheese each (reserve the remaining cheese) shake the ramekins lightly to coat the bottom and sides and place them in the refrigerator.
2. Preheat the oven to 400F (unless you are preparing the batter in advance).
3. Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the flour all at once and whisk it into the butter (this is called a roux blanc). Cook for 2 minutes whisking continually. Add the milk and whisk quickly to incorporate making sure you don't leave any clumps on the bottom and sides of the pan. The mixture will thicken. At the first boil remove from heat. (If this is the first time you do this let me congratulate you: you have just made a bechamel!).
4. Let the bechamel cool for 2 minutes. Add the egg yolks whisking continually to prevent them from cooking and season with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt the freshly ground pepper and a dash of nutmeg. Reserve 3 tablespoons of the remaining grated cheese in a small bowl and fold the rest into the bechamel mixture.
5. In a medium mixing bowl combine the egg whites and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Use an electric whisk to beat the egg whites until stiff. (This will take 3 to 4 minutes at high speed. To know if the egg whites are ready lift the beaters out of the bowl: the egg whites in the bowl should form a rounded peak that doesn't collapse.
6. Spoon one third of the egg whites into the bechamel mixture and stir with a spatula to blend. Fold in the rest of the egg whites very gently lifting the bechamel mixture up and over the egg whites with the spatula until all of the egg whites are incorporated. (The batter can be prepared up to 2 hours in advance- cover tightly and refrigerate. Preheat the oven to 400F 10 to 15 minutes before baking).
7. Remove the ramekins from the fridge and place them on a baking sheet. Divide the souffle batter among the ramekins (they won't be filled to the top). Sprinkle with the reserved grated cheese and bake for 12 to 15 minutes until puffed up and golden (don't open the oven door during the first 12 minutes or you'll be sorry). Serve immediately with a salad of young greens.,

Use your fingers to depress a well in the bottom and fill each one with about 1 soup ladle full of the chicken mixture. Top with about a tablespoon of the tomato mango relish. Replace the top and spoon just a bit of both the sauce and relish over the top. Serve hot.,

3. Simmer the rind and the lardons for ten minutes in 1 1/2 quarts of water.
4. Drain and dry the lardons and rind and reserve.
5. Pre-heat the oven to 450°F.
6. Put the tablespoon of olive oil in a large (9" - 10" wide 3" deep) fireproof casserole and warm over moderate heat.
7. Saute the lardons for 2 to 3 minutes to brown lightly.
8. Remove to a side dish with a slotted spoon.
9. Dry off the pieces of beef and saute them a few at a time in the hot oil/bacon fat until nicely browned on all sides.
10. Once browned remove to the side plate with the bacon.
11. In the same oil/fat saute the onion and the carrot until softened.
12. Pour off the fat and return the lardons and the beef to the casserole with the carrots and onion.
13. Toss the contents of the casserole with the salt and pepper and sprinkle with the flour.
14. Set the uncovered casserole in the oven for four minutes.
15. Toss the contents of the casserole again and return to the hot oven for 4 more minutes.
16. Now lower the heat to 325°F and remove the casserole from the oven.
17. Add the wine and enough stock so that the meat is barely covered.
18. Add the tomato paste garlic and herbs and the bacon rind.
19. Bring to a simmer on the top of the stove.
20. Cover and place in the oven adjusting the heat so that the liquid simmers very slowly for three to four hours.
21. The meat is done when a fork pierces it easily.
22. While the meat is cooking prepare the onions and mushrooms and set them aside till needed.
23. For the onion if using frozen make sure they are defrosted and drained.
24. Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet and add the onions to the skillet.
25. Saute over medium heat for about ten minutes rolling the onions about so they brown as evenly as possible without breaking apart.
26. Pour in the stock season to taste add the herbs and cover.
27. Simmer over low heat for about 40 to 50 minutes until the onions are perfectly tender but retain their shape and the liquid has mostly evaporated.

33. When the meat is tender remover the casserole from the oven and empty its contents into a sieve set over a saucepan.
34. Wash out the casserole and return the beef and bacon to it (discarding the bits of carrot and onion and herbs which remain in the sieve).
35. Distribute the mushrooms and onions over the meat.
36. Skim the fat off the sauce and simmer it for a minute or two skimming off any additional fat which rises to the surface.
37. You should be left with about 2 1/2 cups of sauce thick enough to coat a spoon lightly.
38. If the sauce is too thick add a few tablespoons of stock.
39. If the sauce is too thin boil it down to reduce to the right consistency.
40. Taste for seasoning.
41. Pour the sauce over the meat and vegetables.

instructions, 1. Day One:
2. Rub the duck legs fairly generously with sea salt place in the shallow dish cover with plastic and refrigerate overnight. At all times keep your work area clean and your ingredients free of contamination - meaning don't allow any other food like bread crumbs or scraps to get into your duck duck fat or confit as they will make an otherwise nearly nonperishable preparation suddenly perishable.
3. Day Two:
4. Preheat the oven to 375F/190&deg;C Render (melt) the duck fat in the saucepan until clear. After seasoning with the black pepper (not too much) place the duck legs in the clean ovenproof casserole. Nestle the thyme rosemary and garlic in with it and pour the duck fat over the legs to just cover. Cover the dish with foil and put in the oven. Cook for about an hour or until the skin at the "ankle" of each leg pulls away from the "knuckle." The meat should be tender.
5. Allow to cool and then store as is in the refrigerator sealed under the fat. When you need the confit you can either warm the whole dish in which case removing the legs will be easy or dig them out of the cold fat and scrape off the excess. I highly recommend the former. A nice touch at this point is to twist out the thighbone from the cold confit. Just place one hand on the drumstick pinioning the leg to the table and with the other hand twist out the thighbone plucking it from the flesh without mangling the thigh meat. Think of someone you hate when you do it.,

6. Top with as many potatoes and carrots as you would like.
7. Cook high for 4-5 hours or low for 6-8 hours. Add water whenever necessary to keep meat covered. If cooking unattended start with roughly an inch of covering.
8. Remove potatoes carrots and onion with slotted spoon and set aside to enjoy as side dishes or have onion on sandwiches. Find that pesky bay leaf and discard. Shred meat in place in the pot (or remove shred and return if you prefer).
9. Serve on rolls with cheese of choice. Ladle liquid for dipping if desired or serve sandwiches "wet." May need to stretch with water or additional beef broth. If you are lucky you'll be one of the ones who get a chunk of garlic in your sandwich! MMMMMMMMMMMMMM!
10. Turn pot off for immediate serving or turn to keep warm setting if you would like to keep meat perfect for a potluck or buffet.
11. Experiment! Use more or fewer potatoes carrots or onions. These are my preferences but don't be shy about doing your own thing! I recommend at least some potatoes to pull some of the salt. You can always add more salt later to your taste. I do this in part because I LOVE the flavor imparted from the Himalayan pink salt! If you have never tried it it has a very rich mineral flavor. I have also experimented successfully with other adds such as celery turnips etc. Have fun with it!,

5. Make a well in the dry ingredients and carefully add the yeast into the well.
6. Select the "French" setting on your machine.
7. Select crust color if applicable.
8. Press start!
9. OVEN METHOD:
10. To make loaves in the oven use the "Dough" cycle on your machine.
11. When cycle is complete punch dough down and divide into 2 equal parts.
12. On a lightly floured surface roll each half into a rectangle about 10 x 15.
13. Starting at the long side roll each rectangle jelly roll style into a tight long loaf.  Seal seams and ends by pinching dough together.
14. Place loaves seam sides down on a large ungreased baking sheet.  You may sprinkle some cornmeal or flour on the pan under where you'll be placing the loaves.
15. Cover loaves with a clean towel and let rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes until almost double in size.
16. Preheat oven to 375*.  Place a pan of hot water on the bottom rack of your oven.  This will create steam inside the oven while the bread is baking to give you an authentic crust.
17. Using a very sharp knife carefully make 3 or 4 diagonal slashes in each loaf cutting about 1/2 inch down into dough.
18. If you choose at this time you can carefully brush on an egg white glaze (one egg white beaten with 1 tbl. of water) and sprinkle with sesame seeds poppy seeds dried onion or garlic etc. if desired.
19. Bake for 25-30 minutes (or until loaves sound hollow when tapped) on middle oven rack.
20. Cool on wire racks and serve warm.,

instructions, 1. In a large heatproof bowl or the top pan of a double boiler combine the chocolate butter coffee and rum. Set over (not touching) barely simmering water and stir constantly until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool for 15 minutes.
2. Fold one-third of the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Then fold in the remaining whipped cream just until combined. It’s better to have some streaks of cream in your mousse then to stir the mixture until it loses its airiness. Cover the mousse and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.
3. In a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment combine 1 1/2 cups of the cream and the vanilla and whip on medium-high speed until soft peaks form. (Or use a large bowl and a handheld mixer or a whisk.).
4. Line six half-pint jars with the crumb crust as directed in the recipe.
5. To line jars with the crust spoon about 4 tablespoons of the crumb mixture into each jar. Take the jar in your nondominant hand (left hand if you are right-handed for example) and start pressing the crumb mixture evenly into the bottom of the jar with your other hand. Now work some of the crumb mixture along the sides of the jar pressing firmly. The crust should be about 1/4 inches thick and cover three-fourths of the jar.  Fill the crusts immediately.
6. Whip the remaining 1/2 cup cream until soft peaks form. Spoon about 1/2 cup mousse into each crust-lined jar. Top with about 1 1/2 tablespoon of the ganache then top the ganache with a dollop of the whipped cream. Alternatively top the mousse with a dollop of the cream and grate or shave a little chocolate on top or dust with cocoa powder.
7. Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days. These pies can also be frozen for up to 1 month without the cream topping. Bring to room temperature and add the cream topping just before serving.
8. Chocolate Crumb Crust:  In a bowl combine the crumbs and butter and stir until the mixture is evenly moist.
9. Ganache Filling:  Coarsely chop the chocolate by hand or in a food processor and place in a bowl.
10. In a small saucepan heat the cream over medium heat just until bubbles form around the edges of the pan. Remove from the heat and pour over the chocolate. Let stand for 5 minutes then stir with a wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in the butter until melted.

instructions, 1. Heat oven to 130° oven rack to bottom third of oven this is going to rise.  Butter and sugar – like your were using flour but use sugar to coat the sides of the dishes instead-- one or two tall-sided oven dishes I use 1 soufflé dish and one bread pan usually.
2. Be sure your egg white beating bowls are completely grease free and dry.  Separate your eggs carefully one by one into a separate bowl is best you must not have even the tiniest bit of yellow in your whites or the whole recipe won't work.
3. Start beating the egg whites at a moderate speed until foamy beat in the lemon juice and salt and gradually increase speed to fast you really need an electric beater for this.  When the egg white form soft peak very gradually add the sugar in small amounts then beat at high for a few minutes til you get stiff peaks. Beat in the vanilla.  Scoop the mixture into the prepared dish or dishes  you want them about filled just use a second dish if you have too much. I sometimes use a prepared bread pan for the excess and slide it onto the same oven rack as the soufflé dish.
4. Bake immediately in the preheated oven 35-40 minutes.  It will rise and turn golden.  A bit too much time is better than too little.  Remove and cool at room temperature it will sink a bit.  When cool cover and refrigerate.  May be made up to a couple days in advance and even frozen.
5. Cut into 6 wedges and serve on a pool of cool crème anglaise which is actually a bit difficult to make at home.  If you have any hesitation buy it pre-made.  If you are feeling adventurous use your leftover egg yolks and any crème anglaise recipe from the web and follow the directions EXACTLY-- it must NEVER boil.,

instructions, 1. Using a large pot bring the Water Butter Sugar and Salt to a boil over high heat.
2. Chef's Note: It is important to cube the Butter into small pieces so that it melts completely before the Water comes to a full boil. If the Water boils too soon there will be too much evaporation and the final dough will be too dry.
3. As soon as the Water reaches a boil add the Bread Flour in a single addition. Using a wooden spoon stir the mixture over medium-high heat until a homogeneous dough forms. Continue to actively stir the dough over the heat ("Dessecher") until it forms a ball that easily pulls away from the side of the pot - approximately two to three minutes.
4. Chef's Note: When adding the dry ingredients stir aggressively - the dough should form quickly. Cooking the dough mixture for a couple of minutes causes the starches in the Bread Flour to gelatinize and also dries the dough.
5.  Transfer the dough to a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat the dough on medium speed for several minutes releasing heat and steam. While the dough cools beat the Eggs and Egg Yolks together in a separate bowl and set aside.
6. Once the dough is no longer hot add the Eggs in no fewer than six additions. After each addition mix the dough until the Egg is completely incorporated. When all of the Eggs have been added the dough should be slightly fluid (i.e. when a trench is drawn through the center of the dough it should fill back in within a couple of seconds).
7. Chef's Note: It is important that the dough cools slightly before the Eggs are added or else the Eggs will cook. However if the dough is too cold the Eggs will not mix in well.
8. Form and bake the Pate a Choux according to the specific recipe. Most pastries made with Pate a Choux are baked in a high temperature oven (i.e. 400+ degrees Fahrenheit) for over 20 minutes.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 325 F.
2. Separate egg yolks and place them into a bowl. Place a saucepan on the stove and add 2 cups of heavy cream on low/mid heat.
3. divide your sugar in half (2 small bowls each with 1.5 ounces of sugar. If you have a scale weigh it) Pour one bowl of sugar into the heavy cream and the other into the egg yolks. Mix each with with separate whisks. (Egg yolks should be mixed well but not overbeaten).
4. Add a pinch of salt to the heavy cream mixture on heat and then split your vanilla bean and scrape into the heavy cream. Drop the bean into the cream to ensure that nothing is wasted (It will be strained out later).
5. Stir the heavy cream mixture on heat until it is moderately hot. (When it is uncomfortable to touch).
6. As soon as cream reaches that point remove from head pour into the egg yolk and sugar mixture and blend well.
7. As soon as these two are mixed strain your mixture with a fine wire strainer into a pitcher this will remove all of the large pieces of the vanilla bean that are not wanted.
8. Fill a pan that is at least 3 inches deep about half way with water and place the ramekins into the water (water should NOT get into the ramekins.).
9. Pour your mixture from the pitcher into the ramekins as evenly as possible until you run out.
10. Carefully place pan onto the middle rack of the oven and bake for 30+ minutes (Time sometimes varies Around the 30 minute mark check them by softly disturbing the pan so that it gently shakes. Should shake with similar consistency to jello).
11. Remove from the oven and CAREFULLY place directly into the fridge for approximately 3 hours (DO NOT REMOVE THE WATER FROM THE PAN).
12. Remove the pan from the fridge after 3+ hours and spread a fairly thin layer of sugar over the top of each ramekin.
13. Fire up your torch and carefully burn the sugar on the top of each ramekin. (I always try to avoid the sugar from smoking and turning black which tastes bitter. I usually will do half of one stop and work on another and then finish the first one.).
14. As soon as all of the sugar has been "melted" on all of the ramekins place pan back into the fridge and give them about 30-45 minutes to cool and solidify (It doesn't take that long for the solidification of the sugar but usually after doing this the custard is slightly warm so I always like to have them cooled off).
15. Serve and enjoy!,

4. Add flour in increments blending into the mixture.
5. Drizzle melted margarine into batter continuing to blend with whisk. Set aside.
6. Turn heat up to medium on saute pan and spray lightly with cooking spray for the first crepe. If the cooking spray turns brown the pan is too hot. The spray should remain a clear color.
7. Add 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the batter to the center of the pan. Pick up the pan and swirl the batter to where it forms a circle. (A circular crepe takes practice. The key is to keep the batter thin and uniform in the pan.).
8. When the outside of the crepe's edges start to brown and the top of the crepe is no longer a wet appearance flip the crepe over. Let it cook just a minute more so it's cooked through. Remove from pan onto a plate. Flip the crepe into a half then another half where it forms a quarter of a circle shape.

instructions, 1. Marinade the beef with the herbs shallots & garlic over night in the bottle of red wine.
2. Drain and put the wine to one side.
3. In a large skillet or fryng pan sear & brown the beef pieces over a high heat in the olive oil until nutty & brown. Do not overcrowd the pan!
4. Place browned beef into the crock pot or cast iron Le Creuset Casserole Dish.
5. Fry the lardons or chopped bacon pieces until crispy & golden brown. Drain & add to the beef.
6. Brown the shallots & garlic in the bacon fat & add to the beef & bacon.
7. Add all the other ingredients except the cornflour to the crock pot including the reserved wine.
8. (Add the tinned tomatoes & sun dried tomatoes at this stage too if you are using them.).
9. Cook on automatic or High for 4 hours and Low for up to 6 hours.
10. (For conventional cooking - pre-heat oven to 175 degs C or 325 degs F or gas mark 3 and cook SLOWLY for approximately 4 to 6 hours; check towards the end the meat should be extemely tender - you MUST not be tempted to cook it quicker it will be tough!).
11. Towards the end blend & mix the cornflour with a couple of spoons of the stock in the crock pot & add to the beef stirring well. It should not be TOO thick but just like a glaze or thickened jus. Add the cognac at this stage as well - sirring into the daube.
12. Serve with Green Beans Mashed Steamed or Pureed Potatoes during the colder months OR with a selection of salads crusty French bread & Pasta during the warmer months. The excess sauce can be used or saved as a fantastic gravy or stock later!
13. THIS IS BETTER MADE 24 HOURS BEFORE EATING!
14. Freezes beautifully - I always make a large batch and then freeze some.
15. NOTE:If you cannot buy sun dried orange peel make your own it's VERY easy! Peel some oranges with a swivel head vegetable peeler or parer be careful not to peel the pith. Spread outside on a rack in the full sun and leave to dry for about 2-4 hours. Weather permitting of course - otherwise dry in an airing cupboard or a very LOW oven overnight.Store in an airtight jar for up to 2 years.
16. If you are really stuck - just grate some fresh orange peel into the daube it will not have the same intensity as dried peel but it will work!,

instructions, 1. In a sauce pan put beef consume water garlic cloves and red pepper.  Cover.  Let simmer for how ever long you want to.  I do about an hour on the smallest burner on the stove on the lowest heat.  Stir occasionally when the spirit moves you.
2. Pre-heat oven to 350.
3. Line a baking sheet with foil if you don't want to wash it when done.
4. While the oven is pre-heating saute the onion and 1/2 package of mushrooms in 1 TBS butter and 1TBS olive oil.  Cook to your liking.
5. Open up hoagie rolls and butter them with the horseradish or spicy mustard sauce.
6. Turn up the heat a bit on your sauce pan liquid the au jus and add the roast beef.  Let it warm in the liquid for about 3 minutes.
7. Remove the roast beef from the liquid and start adding it to your hoagie rolls.  Pile some of the onion/mushroom on top then top with cheese.
8. Pop in the oven for 7-10 minutes open face.  I like it a bit crusty so lean towards the 10 minute side if you like it that way.

2. Add sausages and brown - remove & add to onion mixture.
3. Add pork chop pieces & brown - remove and add to above mixture.
4. Make up chicken stock and add wine. Mix tomatoes in with stock & teaspoon of sugar.
5. Pour stock and tomatoes over the cassoulet in crock pot or le creuset - add bouquet garni & give everything a good stir!
6. Add the beans and stir well again.
7. Sprinkle breadcrumbs on top and cook for up to 6 hours on high in crock pot or in le cresuet for 3 hours in a slow oven with the lid on 150C/300°F.
8. Half an hour before serving take lid of le creuset to brown the top. It's difficult to brown in a crock pot but it's not that essential to brown the top as the reason behind the breadcrumbs is to soak up some of the juice & make a crust on top! If your crock pot is the type which you can put under the grill then do so!
9. Serve with mountains of fluffy mashed potatoes & stir-fried Savoy Cabbage.
10. NOTE ON SAUSAGES:
11. Try to use very good quality high meat content sausages; in France Toulouse sausages are mainly used - they generally have a meat content of at least 85%. Good quality English style sausages are also good - I have a recipe posted for some English sausages: Recipe #190045.
12. However  any kind of sausage can be used and in the past I have used: Choritzo Italian Style Chipolatas etc.
13. The Pork chops can be replaced with chicken pieces lamb steaks or Confit D'Canard - preserved duck if you are lucky enought to have some!,

instructions, 1. To make the brioche: mix the salt yeast eggs honey and melted butter with the water in a large bowl. Mix in the flour without kneading. The dough will be loose but will firm up when chilled. Cover the dough with a towel (not to be covered air-tight at this point) and allow to rest a room temperature for 2 hours. Next cover the dough bowl with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge before proceeding to work with it.
2. To make the almond cream: cream together the butter almond paste flour egg and almond extract in a food processor until smooth and set aside.  Note:  The creamy consistency requires a processor for a smooth blend.
3. To assemble the brioche: Dust the brioche dough with flour and gather into a ball stretching the dough around the bottom and sides of the ball.
4. Roll dough out in an 10×14″ rectangle about a 1/4″ thick. This may require quite a bit of flour on the counter to make sure the dough does not stick.
5. Spread the almond cream on the dough leaving an inch clear around the edges. Roll up dough starting from a short end jelly-roll style. Freeze log for about 15 minutes.
6. Grease a 10″ round springform pan with butter and dust with sugar.
7. Cut chilled dough into eight pieces (dental floss works well for a clean cut) and arrange in pan swirl-side up. Allow dough to rest for one hour.
8. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Just before baking mix together sugar zest and almonds and sprinkle over brioche. Bake 50-65 minutes until set in the middle.
9. Remove from oven and allow to sit for 2-3 minutes. Then run a knife around the inside and slide the brioche onto a serving plate. Enjoy warm or room temperature.,

instructions, 1. MAKE HONEY SAUCE:.
2. 1. Microwave: Measure honey into a small microwavable cup or bowl.  Add cinnamon (you don't need to stir it in yet) and cut butter into chunks on top.  Microwave honey and butter for about 60 seconds on medium (60-70% power).  Stir until butter is completely melted.
3. 2.  Stovetop: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low to medium heat then mix in honey and cinnamon stirring until smooth.  Remove from heat.
4. PREPARE THE PAN:.
5. 3.  Lightly grease the sides of a 9x13 pan or baking dish.  You may omit this step but it will help the slices come out neatly when serving.
6. 4.  Pour honey sauce into the 9x13 pan and tilt the pan around until sauce evenly covers bottom.
7. PREPARE THE BREAD:.
8. 5.  Break eggs into a shallow dish (a pie pan works perfectly) and lightly beat with a fork to break the yolks.  Add orange juice and beat thoroughly with a fork.
9. 6.  Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture covering both sides.  Allow any excess egg to run back into the dish.  Place bread on sauce in pan allowing slices to touch on all sides but not overlap one another.
10. 7.  Bake at 400 F for 15-20 minutes or until nicely golden.
11. 8.  "Cut" along the edges of the pan and between each slice of bread with a turner then turn each slice out of the pan and onto a plate with the honey side on top.  The honey sauce will have baked into the bread but if there is any left in the pan spoon it on the top (it will be very thick).
12. NOTES: You can also prepare up through step 6 the night before.  Cover and refrigerate the dish then bake in the morning.  Be sure to use a metal pan and not glass or ceramic if you do this.
13. It isn't as pretty but I often use leftover hamburger or hotdog buns for this recipe.  I prefer the "crust" side down in the honey but my sweetie prefers the "cut" side down so that there is more texture.,

2. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
3. Butter the bottom and sides of a round ceramic pan about 3 1/2 inches deep and large enough to fit all the potatoes (very large). An ordinary baking pan will obviously work too.
4. Sprinkle about half the garlic along the edges of the buttered sides of the pan.
5. Make a layer of potatoes dot with butter pieces sprinkle with salt and pepper drizzle with a few spoonfuls of cream scatter a little garlic on top then repeat in this fashion until all the potatoes have been used.
6. End the top with a dabbing of butter the last slosh of cream and a sprinkling of salt and pepper.
7. Bake for an 60-90 min or until the potatoes are very tender and have absorbed all the cream. The top of the potatoes should be golden brown with darker brown splotches here and there. This dish is very forgiving timewise; if you need more time lower the oven's heat and to speed the cooking up and give it a nice dark topping raise the heat to 400°F for the last 10 to 15 minutes.
8. Enjoy straight out of the casserole (I know you can't help yourself) sprinkling with a little chopped fresh parsley.,

8. Season it with salt pepper soy sauce and Worcestershire at your taste.
9. Fill into the vol-au-vent cases and serve hot with some vegetables.
10. Note: sometimes I add some vegetables (not only the mushrooms!) like carrots or peas directly to this dish.
11. Note: alternative to vol-au-vent cases  are fillo baskets. Instructions: Cut fillo sheets into quarters and layer diagonally in greased ramekins spraying or brushig with olive oil in between layers - 4 squares for each ramekin dish if the sheets are very thin (like fillo for baklava) or 2 squares if they are thicker (like fillo for boureki).  Spray or brush again before cooking at 250°F/180°C for in the oven for more or less 8-10 minutes.
12. Note: For a vegetarian version skip the chicken and use more veggies. For example the double quantity of mushrooms. Chanterelle mushrooms are wonderful for this recipe (see photo).,

instructions, 1. Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan. Add the onions garlic bell peppers and ground chilli powder. Cover and cook over medium-low heat for about 45 minutes until very soft stirring from time to time. If the vegetables start to stick to the pan add a tablespoon of water.
2. In the meantime blanch and peel the tomatoes: fill a medium saucepan with enough water to cover them and bring to a simmer (without the tomatoes). Remove from heat and lower the tomatoes into the water with a slotted spoon. Let sit for a minute and remove with the spoon. Let cook and then peel core and quarter the tomatoes. Discard the juices and seeds.
3. When the peppers and onions are very soft add the tomatoes season with salt and sugar if using and cook uncovered over medium heat for 20 minutes until all the moisture has evaporated. (The vegetables can be cooked up to a day ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container).
4. Crack the eggs in a medium mixing bowl season with salt and beat very lightly with a fork just to break the yolks. Pour into the pan and cook over medium-high heat for a few minutes stirring gently with a spatula until soft curds form and the eggs are almost set but still a little runny. Serve immediately- transfer into a warmed dish or serve straight from the pan- with thinly sliced dry-cured ham if desired.,

cuisine, European >> French >> French, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Special equipment: oven-safe large 2 1/2 or 3 quart round-bottomed bowl.
2. Two days prior to making the dish: remove the core from the cabbage wrap the head tightly in plastic and place it in the freezer; the day you're going to make the dish thaw the frozen head in hot water and the leaves will easily peel off.
3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
4. In a pot boil some water; blanch the slices of salt pork by immersing them in the boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes then rinse them in cold water to halt the cooking and pat them dry.
5. In a skillet over medium heat heat 1 tablespoon of butter with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and sauté the minced onions until tender about 7 minutes.
6. Take 3/4 of the cooked onions and set aside for stuffing; take the remaining cooked onions and set them aside for the sauce.
7. Using 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a small pan over medium heat lightly brown the carrot and thinly sliced onion about 5 minutes.
8. In a mixing bowl combine the ground cooked turkey sausage eggs cloves salt pepper thyme allspice and the cooked onions reserved for the stuffing and mix well; add 5 tablespoons (or more to moisten enough so that the stuffing will adhere to cabbage leaves- see steps below) of the stock and mix.
9. Take the large oven-safe round-bottomed bowl and line the bottom of it with half of the blanched salt pork strips then lay half of the sliced carrots and onions on top.
10. Take the peeled cabbage leaves and select the largest and best to line the bottom (covering the pork carrots and onion) and sides of the bowl- place the leaves with the ends down and the stem-side up.
11. Spread a layer of the stuffing mixture about 1/2-inch thick on the bottom and sides of the bowl (which are now covered with the cabbage leaves) then press some smaller cabbage leaves on top of the stuffing.
12. Repeat the process until the bowl is filled to within 1/2-inch of the top occasionally slipping a large green leaf down the sides of the bowl if necessary to be sure that no gaps appear between the leaves.
13. Cover with a final layer of cabbage leaves and the remaining pork and carrot/onion mixture then pour in enough beef stock to come within 1 inch of the bowl rim.
14. Place the bowl on a pan (to catch drippings) and place in the lower-middle section of the preheated oven; cook for 30 minutes- the cabbage should simmer.
15. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue to bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours; it is done when you place a thermometer into the thickest part of the bowl and the temperature reads 165 degrees F.
16. Check it occasionally as it bakes- you want to keep the cabbage at a slow simmer and you might need to add additional stock if too much evaporates.
17. When the cabbage is almost done and there's only about 15 minutes left for it to bake prepare the sauce: over medium heat in a saucepan stir together the tomato and the remaining cooked minced onion and simmer for 10 minutes.
18. Remove the cabbage from the oven remove the pork carrot and onion from the top layer and drain off 1 cup of the liquid from the bowl; add the liquid to the tomato mixture and simmer an additional 5 minutes.
19. Place a warm serving dish upside-down over the bowl and while holding the dish in place carefully un-mold the cabbage by turning bowl and dish over.
20. Remove the pork carrot and onion mixture from where it was on the bottom of the bowl (which is now the top of the mold).
21. In a saute pan brown the pork strips.
22. To serve pour the tomato sauce around the base of the molded cabbage and garnish with the browned pork strips.,

6. Decrease the heat to the lowest setting and cook the onions stirring often until they are a deep caramel color.
7. Have patience; depending on the heat and the onions this may take an hour or more.
8. Don't be tempted to speed things up because if you burn the onions the soup will have a bitter taste.
9. However if you don't get the onions really brown the soup will be pale in both taste and looks.
10. Sprinkle the flour over the onions and stir for a minute or so to cook away the flour's raw taste.
11. Pour in 1/3 cup wine and stirring to pick up any browned bits sticking to the bottom of the pot let the wine cook away 1-2 minutes.

16. Preheat the broiler; line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper and have six deep ovenproof soup bowls at the ready.
17. In necessary cut the slices of bread so that they fit into your soup bowls; it is up to you whether you want the bread to almost cover the surface of the soup or to float in the soup like a large crouton.
18. Place the bread on the lined baking sheet and broil just until the slices are toasted; flip over and color the other side.
19. Remove the bread and put the soup bowls on the baking sheet.
20. Pour about 1 teaspoon Cognac into each bowl.

instructions, 1. Remove the 12 outermost leaves from the cabbage; blanch for a few minutes in boiling salted water to soften.
2. Rinse blanched leaves in cold water then drain and let dry; cut out a v-shaped "notch" to remove some of the tough rib of each leaf set aside.
3. Core remainder of cabbage and chop inner leaves into 1 inch pieces so that you have about 2 cups; wash and set aside.
4. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
5. Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium high heat; add onion and celery and saute while tossing and stirring until they begin to soften about 5 minutes.
6. Add garlic and cabbage cook another minute or so while tossing and stirring.
7. Season with salt pepper caraway and coriander if using.
8. Pour in stock cover bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer stirring occasionally until most of the liquid evaporates and vegetables are soft about 10 to 15 minutes (if too much liquid remains simply remove cover and continue cooking).
9. Remove vegetables to a mixing bowl and allow to cool; add cooked rice and ground beef mix well (with hands).
10. Be sure mixture is well seasoned as this is the stuffing (to test fry a small amount in butter to taste seasonings).
11. To make the sauce set a casserole or other oven proof pot on the stove top and heat over medium high heat; add oil onion celery and carrots.
12. Saute until vegetables begin to soften about 4 to 5 minutes.
13. Stir in tomatoes salt and pepper and bay leaves; cover and simmer on low while you stuff the cabbage.
14. Okay now the fun part stuffing the cabbage (this is a Jacques Pepin exclusive method that Julia Child found utterly charming and much easier than the traditional method):  Lay a large square of aluminum foil flat on your work surface.
15. Place the four largest cabbage leaves on the foil; they should overlap and form a circle with the "notch" on the outside of the circle.
16. Spread 1/3 of the stuffing on top leaving about a 2 or 3 inch margin all around.
17. Repeat using the next largest leaves and another 1/3 of the stuffing; then layer with the smallest leaves and remainder of the stuffing.
18. Now you are going to use the foil to reshape the cabbage into it's original ball shape no seriously.
19. Lift the corners and outside edges of the foil and bring toward the center so that the bottom layers of cabbage come up and sort of cover the smaller leaf layers.
20. Keep pressing and forming into a ball you will have a small opening at the top of the foil.
21. Pour wine and stock into the casserole with the sauce; invert the cabbage ball and place into the sauce with the opening DOWN.
22. Bring to a boil over high heat cover and place in center of preheated oven.
23. Cook 2 hours.
24. Once done remove cabbage to a serving platter; this can be accomplished heh heh heh with one of those wire pasta thingys or a heavy spatula (the opening should still be down).
25. Pierce the foil and gently remove from around and under without disturbing the shape of the cabbage.
26. Cut into wedges to serve; spoon sauce over or serve on side.,

instructions, 1. In a food processor mix the almonds and sugar until finely ground. Combine with the flour and salt in a medium mixing bowl and set aside.
2. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. When it starts to simmer cook for 2 minutes until it becomes golden brown and starts to smell nutty (this is called beurre noisette). Add the honey and stir to melt.
3. Pour the butter mixture into the dry ingredients and whisk until combined. Add the eggs one by one whisking well after each addition. Pour the batter into a 1-gallon food storage bag (preferably the twist-tie kind) squeeze out all the air and close tightly with knot (or zip closed). This is the homemade version of a pastry bag (which you can use if you have one of course) and it makes the filling of the moulds much neater than using a spoon. Chill for an hour.
4. Preheat the oven to 350F and grease a tray of micro-muffin (or mini-muffin) moulds with butter. (This is unnecessary if they're non-stick silicone or otherwise blessed with magic powers).
5. Remove the bag from the fridge and snip the very tip of one corner with scissors to create a 1/4-inch opening. Press on the bag to pipe the batter into the prepared moulds filling them almost to the rim.
6. Bake for 12-16 minutes depending on the size of your moulds until golden and set. Let stand for a few minutes unmould and transfer to a rack to cool completely. (The financiers will keep for 4 days at room temperature in an airtight container. They can also be frozen for up to a month).,

instructions, 1. Start a few hours before you mean to make up the sauce by infusing the milk. Pour the milk into a saucepan and add the cleaned parsley bay chopped carrot peeled and chopped shallots cloves and whole peppercorns to the pan. Bring the pan to a gentle simmer turn the heat off put the lid on and leave in a warm place for at least two hours.
2. When you are ready to make the sauce strain the milk into a jug and discard the bits of herb shallot and spices. Melt the butter over a low heat in a clean dry saucepan and sprinkle over the flour. Stir with a whisk until the flour and melted butter are combined smoothly in a glossy paste – this is your roux. Be careful not to allow the butter or flour to brown.
3. Stirring all the time add a small amount of milk to the roux continuing to stir until the milk is absorbed into the roux and you have a thick uniform mixture. Add another small amount of milk and repeat until about half the milk is incorporated. Add the rest of the milk in larger amounts whisking as you go and continue to cook very gently until you have a thick and glossy sauce. When all the milk is incorporated keep cooking for about five minutes to cook out any raw flour taste. Take a teaspoon of the sauce and taste it to adjust for the amount of salt you want.
4. If you need to keep the finished sauce warm you can avoid the formation of a skin on top by melting a small amount of butter floating it on top of the sauce and stirring it in when you come to serve or by floating a piece of cling film on the sauce.,

time, ,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 475°F  Cover a large baking sheet with heavy-duty foil.
2. Using a sharp knife (a serrated blade works well) slice each piece of bread almost in half horizontally.  Don't cut quite all the way through; you want to leave about a 1/2-inch crust "hinge" on each piece thus creating a flap or pocket where you can separate the bread and put the filling.
3. To make the filling in a small bowl place the preserves or marmalade and 1/4 cup of the walnuts and beat briskly with a fork to combine.  Spread about 2 tablespoons of the walnut mixture inside each bread pocket then press down lightly on the filled bread to seal.
4. In a pie plate or shallow bowl stir together the egg product milk sugar and cinnamon.  Set aside.  In a large shallow bowl combine the corn flakes and the remaining 1/4 cup of walnuts.  Crush the corn flakes between your fingers until they are broken into tiny irregular pieces. Dip each slice of filled bread into the egg mixture turning it three or four times until the bread is completely coated and has absorbed some of the egg--but don't let the bread get soggy.  Then press each slice on both sides into the walnut-corn flake crumbs.  Pat the crumbs on if necessary to make them stick and don't worry if the coating is not completely even.  Continue until all the bread has been dipped and coated setting the prepared slices aside on a sheet of waxed paper as you work.
5. Place the foil-covered baking sheet in the oven to heat for about 3 minutes.   Remove from the oven and rapidly coat the foil with nonstick cooking spray then quickly place the bread in a single layer on the foil.  Bake for about 5 minutes until lightly browned on the bottom.  Flip the slices over and bake 3 - 4 minutes longer.  Transfer to warmed plates or a platter dust with powdered sugar and serve with maple syrup if desired.,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2. On a floured cold surface roll out the pie dough to a 14-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick. Roll the dough onto the rolling pin and unroll onto the tart pan (use an 11" pan with a removable bottom).
3. Gently mold the dough around the edges to completely line the pan. Roll the rolling pin over the edges of the pan to cut off the excess dough. Patch any spots with the extra dough and then freeze any remaining for later use. Chill the molded pie shell for about 20 minutes before baking or freeze well wrapped until ready to use.
4. When ready to bake score the bottom of the tart shell with fork marks to prevent the dough from bubbling. “Blind bake” the tart shell by covering it fully with a sheet of parchment paper and filling the tart with rice or dried beans making sure to completely fill in the shape of the shell with the beans. This weighted process will allow the crust to bake without shrinking or losing its shape.
5. Bake for about 30 minutes until shape has set and the dough is lightly colored.
6. Remove the beans and parchment and store for later use.
7. Return the tart shell to the oven and bake another 10 minutes until it is golden brown.
8. Meanwhile heat the butter and oil in a heavy based sauté pan. Add the onions and cook gently over medium heat until the onions are caramelized about 30 minutes.
9. Once caramelized add the sherry and cook until the liquid has evaporated and the onions are dry.
10. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
11. Remove to a plate and chill in the refrigerator. The onions can be made two or three days ahead.
12. Toast the walnuts in the oven until lightly colored about 10 minutes. When cool enough to handle coarsely chop the nuts and then place in a colander or large holed strainer and shake until most of the bitter skins or “dust” is removed. Set aside until ready to use. The nuts can also be prepared ahead and kept well covered.
13. To make the custard simply whisk together the yolks and the heavy cream until mixed and season with salt pepper and cayenne.
14. To assemble cover the bottom of the tart shell with an even distribution of the caramelized onions.
15. Repeat again with the walnuts and then the Roquefort.
16. Cover with the custard and bake in the preheated oven for about 40 minutes or until just golden. Remove from the oven and allow to set before serving.,

instructions, 1. Mix the herbes de provence ground fennel ground pepper and thyme together.
2. Pat the beef dry with paper towels (this is important as surface moisture will interfere with good browning). Lightly oil outside of the roast with the olive oil.
3. Rub the mixture over the roast so that all surfaces are coated with the herbs.
4. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Sear the roast on all sides (about 3 rotations approximately 1 minutes each). When browned immediately remove from heat.
5. NOTE: for best results fill the crockpot 2/3 full with roast and vegetables; this produces the best results when using a crockpot.
6. Add the beef broth to crockpot.
7. Add the roast to the crockpot. Layer carrots potatoes and onions on top and sides of roast sprinkling each layer with herbes thyme and salt as desired.
8. Cook on high for 2 hours then reduce temperature to low and cook an additional 4 hours.
9. When ready to serve carefully remove roast (it may fall apart) to platter and surround with carrots potatoes and onions.  This will not make as pretty a presentation as a roast and vegetables roasted in the oven; the crockpot tends to turn things a dull brown color but the flavors are usually magnified.
10. Add au jus as desired.
11. Serve with a green salad and toasted french bagette slices with butter.,

instructions, 1. Put the duck legs into a large container (a large heavy-duty ziplock bag works well) and add the salt pickling spices garlic onion and thyme. Mix together thoroughly making sure each leg is coated with the salt. Cover with plastic wrap (if not using a bag) and refrigerate for at least 18 hours and up to 2 days.
2. In a very large Dutch oven or other large heavy-based pot melt most of the fat slowly over low heat. Remove the duck legs from the refrigerator. Reserve the garlic from the marinade. Rinse each duck leg well under cold running water to rinse the salt off and pat dry well using paper towels.
3. Heat the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
4. Slip the legs and the garlic into the pot of warm fat. The fat should cover the duck completely. If it does not add more fat. Cook the legs over medium heat until the temperature of the fat reaches 190 degrees Fahrenheit on a candy/ frying thermometer then cover the pot and carefully move it into the oven. Bake at 200 degrees until the legs are fork-tender about 3 hours.
5. Remove the pot from the oven and allow the duck legs to cool in the fat for about half an hour. Have ready one or more clean containers to hold the duck legs and the fat. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the legs into the containers. Remove the garlic from the pot but do not add it to the duck legs - set it aside (see note at end of recipe).
6. Allow the duck fat to cool but do not let it solidify. Using a fine-mesh strainer strain the fat over the duck legs leaving behind any debris or juices from the duck legs which will have sunk to the bottom of the pot. Make sure that the legs are completely covered and tap the containers lightly on the counter to help remove any air bubbles. Reserve any remaining clear strained duck fat and store in the refrigerator.
7. Refrigerate the confit until the fat hardens fully. When the fat is hard add another 1/2 inch layer of melted fat (which you saved from earlier in the fridge. If you did not have enough to save you could use fresh pork lard or peanut oil) to ensure that the legs are completely sealed in fat. Refrigerate the confit to allow the legs to "mellow" and develop flavor for at least a few days and up to 1 month before using.
8. To use the confit let the fat in the container soften at room temperature. Or set the container in a pan of warm water. Take out as many pieces as you plan to use. Cover the remaining pieces with more fat or peanut oil (the confit becomes more perishable once the seal is broken so use the rest within a week or so). Scrape away the fat clinging to the confit and use as you like or as directed in a recipe. If you are using the confit on its own in a salad heat it under a broiler until the skin is crispy.
9. Note on garlic: press the garlic through a mesh strainer. You now have an excellent garlic purée to add to sauces stews or to spread on bread.,

2. Peel the potatoes and cut into chunky sized chips. Rinse and dry thoroughly.
3. Fry chips for about 3 minutes until soft but NOT coloured. Drain and shake well and set to one side.
4. Put some flour onto a plate. Dredge the fish fillets in the flour thoroughly - this is VERY important it stops the batter sliding off when fried! Leave the fish fillets in the flour whilst you make the batter.
5. Some people say you should make the batter at least one hour before - I have found little difference - so make it before if it is convenient or now!
6. Put flour bicarbonate of soda salt and pepper into a large roomy bowl. Add the beer gradually stop when you have a thick coating type of batter. Drink any beer that is left! Whisk thoroughly until it is smooth and there are no lumps.Add the lemon juice OR a splash of malt vinegar if desired. Mix thoroughly again.
7. Have your plates newspaper or whatever ready for eating!
8. Adjust deep fat fryer to fish frying temperature of 160°C.
9. Take one fillet of fish at a time and holding it by the tail or thin end (!) swirl it around the batter until well coated - plunge into hot fat immediately. As soon as it has crisped up and set add your other fillets one at a time taking out the first ones as they cook - about 6 to 10 minutes depending on the thickness. Place onto a tray and keep warm in the oven.
10. Turn up the heat setting to 190°C again and cook your chips until golden and crisp.
11. Serve on plates or newspaper with salt & vinegar!
12. All you need now is a pint of warm beer and Coronation Street on the TV to set the scene!
13. This batter is great for small fish goujons chicken goujons and also tempura vegetables too.,

3. Empty the salsa into a large mixing bowl add the water (if using) garlic powder chipotle chilli powder salt and pepper to taste. Mix well. Adjust seasonings if necessary.
4. Pour 1/4 of the salsa mixture over the base of the greased baking dish and then layer 1/4 of the flour tortilla strips over the top. Scatter some of the chopped olives and sweet corn over and then add some of the chopped chicken and chorizo. Top with more salsa and continue to layer in this pattern until the last layer. For the last layer spoon the sour cream over the top before finishing with the salsa mixture and then scatter the grated/shredded cheese over the top. (Can be frozen at this stage cover and freeze for up to 2 months.).
5. Cover the casserole with aluminium foil and bake for 35 minutes; take the foil off and finish baking for 5 to 10 minutes longer or until the topping is bubbling and the cheese is melted and golden.
6. Serve immediately with sour cream jalapeño peppers and chopped cilantro or parsley. I find that a green salad is the perfect accompaniment to this but rice would also be good.
7. To cook from the freezer: Thaw the casserole in the fridge for 24 hours before removing for 30 minutes before baking as instructed before.,

6. If it feels just moist and some dough sticks to my fingers it's just right.
7. If no dough sticks it's a bit dry and add a few teaspoons of water.
8. If it feels too soft and very sticky add more flour until you get the right consistency after about another 5 minutes of kneading.,

2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Boil a kettle of water. Have ready eight 8-ounce ramekins or wide-mouth glass canning jars (without lids) and a roasting pan large enough to hold them in a single layer.
3. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the leeks and cook for 3 minutes until softened. Drain and rinse them under cold running water until cooled. Use your hands to squeeze all of the water from the leeks and place them in a medium bowl to yield about 1/2 cup. Add the Gruyere cooked bacon salt pepper and nutmeg; mix well.
4. Divide the bacon filling evenly among 4 ramekins each. Crack 2 raw eggs in each ramekin. Spoon a teaspoon of heavy cream over the egg whites in each ramekin leaving the yolks exposed. Season each ramekin lightly with salt and pepper.
5. Place the ramekins in the roasting pan. Transfer the pan with the ramekins to the middle rack of the oven. Pour in enough of the boiled water to come one-third of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Bake for 11 to 14 minutes or until the whites are set (opaque and firm when tested with the tip of a paring knife) but the yolks are still runny.

instructions, 1. Combine the butter and sugar in a food processor and process until fluffy. Add the egg and orange flower water and mix until blended. Add the flour and salt and mix until smooth. Turn out the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead gently until it forms a ball. Add a touch more flour if the dough is too moist or a little ice-cold water a teaspoon at a time if it is too dry. Divide the dough into two slightly flattened balls wrap each half in plastic and refrigerate for an hour or up to a day.
2. Preheat the oven to 350F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
3. Remove one ball of dough from the refrigerator and divide it into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece with the palm of your hand on your work surface until it forms a log about 3 inches in length. Cut the log in two with a knife so you have two 1 1/2 inch logs and set aside. Repeat with the other pieces until you have sixteen small logs.
4. Pinch the ends of each log and flatten the top slightly to form a boat shape. With the tip of a round-ended knife carve a deep slit lengthwise down the centre not quite reaching the other side or the ends. Arrange the cookies on the baking sheet and repeat with the second half of the dough.
5. Brush with the egg yolk mixture. Bake for 15 minutes until golden and slightly browned at the tips. Transfer to a rack to cool completely and serve with coffee or tea. The navettes will keep for a couple of weeks at room temperature in an airtight container. They will harden after the first few days but you can revive their initial texture by reheating them for 3-4 minutes at 350F - in Provence they claim that a bit of their sunshine does the trick. The dough can also be frozen for up to a month.,

instructions, 1. One hour before starting take the egg whites out of the refrigerator.
2. Preheat the oven to 150 degrees Celcuis.
3. Mix the icing sugar caster sugar and ground almonds in a blender until they form a fine powder.
4. Whisk the egg whites with a pinch of caster (superfine) sugar until they form soft peaks then when it begins to look 'moussey' (not sure how to translate "commence a mousser") add 20g of sugar and whisk until the egg whites form stiff peaks.
5. Tip the egg white mixture into the almond mixture and and fold (the recipes says "macaronnez" I don't think that's translatable!) together using a spatula until they form a smooth paste but be careful not to let them become liquidy.
6. Using a 8mm piping bag pipe little mounds (about 60) of the mixture on a greased baking sheet spacing them about 3-4cm apart.
7. Leave in the oven for 12-14 minutes being careful not to let them brown too much.  After that time take them out of the oven and allow them to cool before decorating.  Turn the oven down to 90 degrees Celcius.
8. While they're cooling beat the egg yolks and sugar together until they become pale.
9. In a separate bowl whisk the cream with the vanilla until it thickens slightly then tip it into the egg yolk mixture.  Mix together gently so it doesn't turn into a mousse.
10. Pour the creme into a greased flan or pie dish measuring about 18cm (7-8 inches) and place in the oven for 1 hour and 20 minutes.  After that time leave it to cool for an hour then place it in the fridge to set for at least four hours.
11. When you're ready to serve (finally!) take the creme out of the fridge and stamp out discs the same size as the macaroons and place on the flat side of one macaroon.  Sprinkle with demerera sugar and caramelize using a blow torch then place on a small tea plate placing another macaroon flat side down on one edge as a 'lid' to make 30 macaroons.
12. I promise you it's worth the effort!  They look really impressive but it made me realize how hard French patissiers must work.,

instructions, 1. Crust:  Preheat the oven to 375º.  Put the flour sugar and salt in the bowl and pulse a few times to mix.  Dump in all the butter and pulse about 15 times total.  You want to cut the butter up smaller than you would for a flaky pie crust. Add in 2 tablespoons of the ice cold water and turn the machine on for 5-6 seconds.  You’ll know that you have the right amount of moisture in the dough by removing the lid reaching in and grabbing a handful squeeze it together and if it clumps…it’s perfect.  If it is still crumbly and does not stick together then put the lid back on add another ½ to 1 teaspoon of ice water and turn on again for another 5-6 seconds.
2. Press dough in tart pan. Try and make it an even layer across the bottom of the pan.
3. To avoid shrinkage place it on a plate and put it in the freezer to firm up and rest for at least 30 minutes.
4. Cook bacon until crispy. Less 2 tablespoons of drippings in pan and cook onions on low/med heat with thyme & salt covered 20mins. So not brown sweat the onions. Pull crust out of the freezer place it on a cookie sheet add a sheet of foil on top and press it in gently and then fill with your favorite pie weight (dry beans rice actual pie weights marbles ball bearings).  Place in the oven for 30 minutes while the onions are cooking.
5. Beat the eggs and add in the half and half a grind or two of black pepper and a touch of salt mix well and set aside. The onions they should be translucent soft and very fragrant.  Remove them from the heat and cool long enough that they won’t cook the eggs. When the crust comes out remove the pie weights and foil.  Remove the thyme sprigs from the onions and mix them into the custard.  Pour it all into the tart crust sprinkle with bacon pieces and put it back in the 375º oven for 25-30 minutes on the middle rack.,

2. Cool to room temperature and combine with the remaining ingredients (be careful with salt--the cheese is powerful).

instructions, 1. Place the chocolate in a medium-size heatproof bowl.
2. Bring the cream just to a boil in a small saucepan. As soon as it begins to boil pour it through a FINE strainer and into the bowl with the chocolate.
3. Whisk the cream and chocolate together until the chocolate is completely melted. Whisk in the Crème de Cassis.
4. Cover and refrigerate until stiff and cold at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.
5. Scoop up some of the chilled chocolate mixture with a very small scoop or a teaspoon and roll between your palms to make 3/4-inch balls (they don't have to be perfectly round). Work quickly so the chocolate doesn't melt in your hands. (I just used the small scoop and did not roll in my hands) Transfer the balls to a waxed paper-lined baking sheet setting them 1/2-inch apart.
6. Wipe your hands periodically with paper towels to remove any chocolate left behind from rolling.
7. If the truffle mixture becomes too soft to roll return it to the refrigerator briefly to firm up before continuing.
8. Lightly cover the balls with plastic wrap and return to the refrigerator until cool and firm. Place the *cocoa powder in a pie plate or other flat-bottomed dish with sides and roll the truffles in the cocoa powder a few at a time until coated.
9. Store the truffles in a waxed paper-lined tin in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
10. *Another idea would be to roll the truffles in a finely powdered nut mixture.

6. -Note the egg white is not used but can be added if desired by beating whites untill stiff then adding a few tbsps of sugar slowly.When of meringue consistency pipe rings around the outside of the pastry shell or if desired make small peaks over the top of the lemon mix.this addition works best when you are using home made pastry cases as it requires slightly longer cooking at a lower temperature.,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2. In a food processor pulse the graham cracker crumbs with the melted butter and light brown sugar until the crumbs are moistened. Press the crumbs evenly into a 9-inch glass or metal pie plate. Bake for about 10 minutes just until lightly browned. Let cool. Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees.
3. Scrape the condensed milk into a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish and sprinkle with a scant 1/2 teaspoon of fleur de sel. Cover the dish with foil and place it in a roasting pan. Add enough hot water to the pan to reach one-third of the way up the side of the baking dish. Bake lifting the foil to stir 2 or 3 times until the condensed milk is golden and thickened about 2 hours; add more water to the roasting pan as necessary (watch water level carefully). The consistency of the caramel should be like dulce de leche. Don't worry if it is lumpy; it will smooth out as it chills.  (You may have many lumps but it will work out.)
4. Scrape the caramel filling into the pie crust smoothing the top. Spray a sheet of plastic wrap with vegetable oil spray and cover the pie. Refrigerate until the filling is chilled and set at least 4 hours.
5. In a bowl using an electric mixer beat the cream with the confectioners' sugar until very firm peaks form. Remove the plastic. Mound the whipped cream on top of the pie and sprinkle with fleur de sel. Cut into wedges and serve.,

Add the balance of the flour 1/2 cup at a time turning the machine on briefly after each addition. When the mixture forms a mass and begins to clean the sides of the bowl knead for 30 seconds. Don't overknead!
6. This begins the process of cooling the dough and at the same time allowing it to rise. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
7. Determine that both butter and dough are about the same temperature — 65°F (23°C) is ideal. The block of butter should bend but not break (too cold) nor be oily (too warm) when bent slightly. This may mean taking the butter out of the refrigerator an hour or so early to reach workable temperature. Likewise for the dough. Place the dough on a floured work surface and with the hands press it into a 10" square. Unwrap the block of butter and lay the block diagonally on the dough. Bring each point of dough into the center overlapping the edges at least 1". Press the dough into a neat package. With a heavy rolling pin roll the dough into a rectangle approximately 8" x 18". This dimension is not critical.
8. Caution: If the butter seems to be breaking into small pieces under the dough rather than remaining solid allow the dough/butter to warm a few minutes. But if the butter softens becomes sticky and oozes while making the turns put the dough back into the refrigerator for several minutes.
9. Fold the length of dough into thirds as for a letter. Turn so that the open ends are at twelve and six o'clock. Roll again into a rectangle. This time fold both ends into the middle and then close as one would a book. The dough will now be in 4 layers. Wrap the package of dough in a cloth (an old tea towel is good) that has been soaked in cold water and wrung dry. Place the wrapped dough in the refrigerator to relax and chill for 1 or 2 hours.
10. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on the floured work surface. Unwrap roll out and fold in thirds as for a letter. This is the final turn before it is rolled out and cut into croissants. Dampen cloth again and wrap loosely around the dough. Place the package in a plastic bag so moisture will be retained (not pulled out of the cloth). Leave in the refrigerator 4 to 6 hours or overnight.
11. Mix together the egg and 1 Tbsp of water. Have ready the egg wash a knife or pastry cutter and a wooden yardstick if you wish the pieces to be cut precisely otherwise plan to cut them freehand. You may have or can borrow a French croissant cutter that cuts the dough into triangles.
12. Sprinkle work surface with flour. Roll the dough until it is a generous 10"-x-38" rectangle and most importantly about 1/4" thick. This is a crucial dimension since it determines the size and texture of the croissants. Trim irregularities to make the strip uniform in width. Cut the strip lengthwise to make two 5" pieces. Mark the strip into triangles 5" wide on the bottom. Using a yardstick as a guide cut through the dough with a pastry or pizza cutter or knife. Separate the triangles place them on a baking sheet and chill for 15 to 20 minutes. Roll the dough into the traditional croissant shape by rolling the triangle from the bottom to the point.
13. Place the croissants on a baking sheet and allow to rise for 1 to 2 hours in which they will double in volume.
14. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Bake the croissants for 22 to 25 minutes. Allow them to cool on a rack before serving.
15. Yield: 24 to 30 croissants.,

instructions, 1. use granny smith apples because of their low water content. juicy apples like McIntosh fall apart and turn to mush (He wasn't lying. That's the worse batch I made!).
2. Make the batter for the French toast by whisking together the eggs milk vanilla and cinnamon until evenly blended. Cover and refrigerate.
3. Pay close attention while you make the apples.
4. Put the sugar in a large dry skillet and place it over medium-low heat.
5. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon  until the sugar melts and begins to caramelize about 5 minutes. Be careful; the sugar is really hot at this point.
6. Still stirring add the butter which will foam a little.
7. Once the sugar and butter become a caramel sauce fold in the apple wedges. Now because the apples are cooler than the sugar the sugar may start to seize and harden but don't trip out- KEEP STIRRING! Once the apples warm up the caramel will smooth out again.
8. When the caramel sauce loosens up and coats the apples pour in the maple syrup.
9. Give it a stir and simmer for about 10 minutes until the apples are fork tender.
10. Pull them off the heat and keep them warm.
11. For the french toast itself warm the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium low heat.
12. You'll probably only be able to fit a couple of croissants in the pan at once so make them in batches.
13. Take a croissant half and dredge it quickly in the batter. Do this QUICKLY or else the croissant will disintegrate if soaked in the batter.
14. Lay the croissants in the pan cut side down and cook for 4-5 minutes. Carefully flip them over with a spatula and brown the other side.
15. The presentation is like a caramel apple sandwich. Put the bottom half of the croissant on a plate; spoon some of the caramel apples on top of that and cover with the top half of the croissant.

instructions, 1. FOR THE MERINGUE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Using ruler and pencil draw 13 by 10 1/2-inch rectangle on piece of parchment paper. Grease baking sheet and place parchment on it ink side down.
2. Process almonds hazelnuts cornstarch and salt in food processor until nuts are finely ground 15 to 20 seconds. Add 1/2 cup sugar and pulse to combine 1 to 2 pulses.
3. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk whip egg whites and cream of tartar on medium-low speed until foamy about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip whites to soft billowy mounds about 1 minute. With mixer running at medium-high speed slowly add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue to whip until glossy stiff peaks form 2 to 3 minutes. Fold nut mixture into egg whites in 2 batches. With offset spatula spread meringue evenly into 13 by 10 1/2-inch rectangle on parchment using lines on parchment as guide. Using spray bottle evenly mist surface of meringue with water until glistening. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Turn off oven and allow meringue to cool in oven for 1 1/2 hours. (Do not open oven during baking and cooling.) Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature about 10 minutes. (Cooled meringue can be kept at room temperature tightly wrapped in plastic wrap for up to 2 days.).
4. FOR THE BUTTERCREAM: Heat milk in small saucepan over medium heat until just simmering. Meanwhile whisk yolks sugar cornstarch and salt in bowl until smooth. Remove milk from heat and whisking constantly add half of milk to yolk mixture to temper. Whisking constantly return tempered yolk mixture to remaining milk in saucepan. Return saucepan to medium heat and cook whisking constantly until mixture is bubbling and thickens to consistency of warm pudding 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer pastry cream to bowl. Cover and refrigerate until set at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours. Before using warm gently to room temperature in microwave at 50 percent power stirring every 10 seconds.
5. Stir together amaretto and espresso powder; set aside. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle beat butter at medium speed until smooth and light 3 to 4 minutes. Add pastry cream in 3 batches beating for 30 seconds after each addition. Add amaretto mixture and continue to beat until light and fluffy about 5 minutes longer scraping down bowl thoroughly halfway through mixing.
6. FOR THE GANACHE: Place chocolate in heatproof bowl. Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat. Pour cream mixture over chocolate and let stand for 1 minute. Stir mixture until smooth. Set aside to cool until chocolate mounds slightly when dripped from spoon about 5 minutes.
7. Carefully invert meringue and peel off parchment. Reinvert meringue and place on cutting board. Using serrated knife and gentle repeated scoring motion trim edges of meringue to form 12 by 10-inch rectangle. Discard trimmings. With long side of rectangle parallel to counter use ruler to mark both long edges of meringue at 3-inch intervals. Using serrated knife score surface of meringue by drawing knife toward you from mark on top edge to corresponding mark on bottom edge. Repeat scoring until meringue is fully cut through. Repeat until you have four 10 by 3-inch rectangles. (If any meringues break during cutting use them as middle layers.).
8. Place 3 rectangles on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Using offset spatula spread 1/4 cup ganache evenly over surface of each meringue. Refrigerate until ganache is firm about 15 minutes. Set aside remaining ganache.
9. Using offset spatula spread top of remaining rectangle with 1/2 cup buttercream; place on wire rack with ganache-coated meringues. Invert 1 ganache-coated meringue place on top of buttercream and press gently to level. Repeat spreading meringue with 1/2 cup buttercream and topping with inverted ganache-coated meringue. Spread top with buttercream. Invert final ganache-coated strip on top of cake. Use 1 hand to steady top of cake and spread half of remaining buttercream to lightly coat sides of cake then use remaining buttercream to coat top of cake. Smooth until cake resembles box. Refrigerate until buttercream is firm about 2 hours. (Once buttercream is firm assembled cake may be wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days.).
10. Warm remaining ganache in heatproof bowl set over barely simmering water stirring occasionally until mixture is very fluid but not hot. Keeping assembled cake on wire rack pour ganache over top of cake. Using offset spatula spread ganache in thin even layer over top of cake letting excess flow down sides. Spread ganache over sides in thin layer (top must be completely covered but some small gaps on sides are OK).
11. Garnish top of cake with hazelnuts. Holding bottom of cake with 1 hand gently press almonds onto sides with other hand. Chill on wire rack uncovered for at least 3 hours or up to 12 hours. Transfer to platter. Cut into slices with sharp knife that has been dipped in hot water and wiped dry before each slice. Serve.,

instructions, 1. Use a 6-8 cup souffle dish or 4 individual 10 ounce souffle dishes.
2. Pull a sheet of aluminum foil slightly more then 3 times longer then the diameter of the dish and fold it lengthwise over itself with the shiny side showing. The foil strip should be wide enough to cover the outside of the dish and rise at least 3 inches above the rim.
3. Rub the strip of foil and the inside of the dish  with softened butter. Wrap the foil around the dish and attach it by pinching together at the top so it stays in place (you can also use a paper clip).
4. Evenly sprinkle the Parmigiano-Reggiano all around the dish and the foil until they are covered with a layer of cheese. Do NOT touch the inside after this point. Put dish in refrigerator.
5. Make the Mornay Sauce: Melt butter in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan and stir in the flour with a whisk until smooth. Gradually pour in milk while whisking and bring to a simmer over high heat while continuing to whisk. Boil for a couple of minutes until sauce thickens a bit and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano and season with salt pepper and nutmeg. Whisk in egg yolks one at a time. Reserve up to 2 days covered.
6. Preheat oven to 350°F if you are using a 6 or 8 cup souffle dish or to 375°F if you are using individual souffle dishes.
7. Beating and Folding: Put egg whites into a very clean bowl of standing mixer fitted with whisk. Turn on low to break up the whites. Add a pinch of salt and a small pinch of cream of tartar. Gradually increase speed to high. Keep a sharp eye on the whites it only takes about 4 minutes to get to stiff peaks – that’s when they stick straight out when you hold the whisk or beater sideways instead of softly flopping over. Take the bowl off the standing mixer and finish the soufflé by hand (or 6-8 minutes by hand).
8. Take out one-fourth of the beaten whites and stir into 1 cups of the cooled (but not cold) Mornay Sauce – this lightens up the Mornay and makes it easier to fold in the whites.
9. Pour the Mornay Sauce down the side of the bowl containing the remaining whites and sprinkle the 3/4 cup finely grated cheese over the top. Fold everything together using a rubber spatula pressing the spatula down to the bottom of the bowl where most of the heavier sauce base will have settled and lift up the base gently folding it over the whites. Continue cutting into the whites but not pushing against them to combine the mixture. Don’t overdo it; a few uncombined pieces of white are less of a problem than overworking the mixture.
10. Gently pour the mixture into the soufflé dishes – the mixture should come up somewhere between 3/4ths of the way up and the top. Slide the sheet pan of soufflés into the oven. Turn up the oven to 375°F or to 385°F if making individual souffles.
11. Bake a large souffle for 40 to 50 minutes or individual souffles for 15 to 20 minutes. Soufflés are done when risen about half its original height and when sheet pan jiggled back and forth the tops won’t rock – if the insides are underdone the tops will rock slightly.
12. Side Note: "If you rush the soufflé to the table and cut into it and see that it’s undercooked don’t panic. Be as nonchalant as possible and just put soufflés back in the oven and cook it a few more minutes. An underdone soufflé won’t fall much once out of the oven an overdone one will.".
13. Take the sheet pan with the soufflés out of the oven and immediately pull away the collar and bring the souffle to the table. If you are serving individual soufflés put each souffle on a plate and sit it before a guest. If you are serving one big soufflé serve it at the table on heated plates. Make sure everyone gets some savory crust. The creamy center should function as a sauce for the rest.,

time, ,

instructions, 1. Infuse the milk with the Vanilla or Vanillin by heating it to almost boiling and then turning it off.  While the milk is cooling --
2. Make the carmel and coat the forms in Caramel. In your widest sautee pan add the sugar and turn the flame to high and wait. DO NOT STIR - at most pick up the pan and swish it around to make sure the sugar is evenly melted in the carmel. As soon as almost all of the sugar has turned to carmel turn off the heat.
3. Hold the form with your oven-mitt-covered hand or some other protection that will not limit your dexterity yet protect your hand form the hot scalding sugar. With the other hand pour a little carmel in the bottom and then twirl it around covering the form internally and on the sides as much as you can. I highly recommend you read David Lebovitz's How to Make the Perfect Carmel primer before caramelizing sugar for the first time. Once all of your forms have been coated with caramel on the inside move to making the creme.
4. Using a fork or a whisk mix 4 whole eggs plus one yolk with the sugar. Then add the cooled infused milk.  Mix well -the resulting consistency will be very liquid.
5. Fill the forms by pouring or using a soup ladle  leaving 1/2" or 1 cm space from the top. Cover the forms with tinfoil.
6. Prepare the pressure cooker by adding two cups of water and the trivet or collapsible steamer basket.
7. Place as many forms as possible that will stay straight - for me it's three of the big teacups or 4 of the medium glass forms and 5 espresso cups -but they are really small so I make these for the kids!
8. Close and lock the pressure cooker top turn the flame to high and when it begins to whistle turn the flame down to minimum.  Count 10 minutes. When time is up release all of the vapor and do not open the top.
9. Let the forms sit in the locked pan with no heat for another 5 minutes. When time is up  open the top and check for doneness by sticking a toothpick in the middle of one of the cremes. If it comes out dirty simply place the pressure cooker cover back on without turning on the flame again and wait another 5 minutes.
10. Let your creme caramels cool outside the pan for about an hour before refrigerating.
11. Refrigerate for at least two hours before serving.   If you need to do another batch remember to add more water in your pressure cooker!
12. To serve simply turn the form upside-down onto each dessert dish.  If the Creme Caramel does not come down on it's own insert a flat knife and run it carefully along the sides. Then on one side pull the knife a little towards the center to break the suction. Place the dessert plate on top of the form and flip it around quickly.,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Heat the cream in a sauce pan. Stir occasionally to keep skin from forming. Just before it is boiling remove from heat and add vanilla.
3. Meanwhile cream egg yolks and sugar in a bowl. Try not to incorporate any air into the mix. I find that a fork works well for this small amount --  a whisk is too big.
4. SLOWLY drizzle cream into eggs continuing to mix with the fork. If you pour too quickly you will cook the egg. Again try not to incorporate any air as you mix.
5. Drain the peaches and place peach slices in the bottom of each ramekin. Then pour the custard on top of the peaches. You want to have enough custard that the peaches are completely covered. Narrower taller ramekins work better than wider shorter ones.
6. Place ramekins in a baking tray or roasting pan then pour water into the pan (don't splash into the custard) so that it comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Carefully place in the oven (don't splash into the custard) and bake about 30 minutes. Custard is done when it is set but still jiggles.
7. Remove from the oven and remove from the water bath. Allow to cool completely. Then cover with plastic wrap and chill for a couple hours in the fridge. You can store like this for several days if you like.
8. Just before serving sprinkle a thin layer of brown sugar on top of each custard and use a kitchen torch (or your oven's broiler) to melt and caramelize the sugar. Try not to burn it. If you are using the broiler be careful it burns very quickly. Don't take your eyes off of it!,

instructions, 1. Put the cut-up butter in a 1-cup glass measure with a pouring spout and microwave until completely melted and clear but not bubbling (or heat in a warm oven 190°F. about 30 minutes).  Skim off any foam from the top and cool until lukewarm but still liquid.
2. Combine the vinegar water and seasonings in a 3-cup heavy-bottomed non-reactive saucepan and simmer slowly over medium-low heat until the liquid reduces to 1 teaspoon.  Mix in 1/2 tablespoon cool water strain the liquid into a cup and return it to the saucepan.
3. Whisk in the yolk then 1/4 of the clarified butter.  Place over medium-low heat and continue whisking across the bottom and around the sides of the pan until the yolk-and-butter mixture thickens to a sour cream consistency.  If the yolk is overcooked it will start to scramble; if undercooked (as in "blender Hollandaise" recipes) it will taste raw.
4. Dunk the pan briefly in cold water; then slowly dribble in the rest of the butter off heat whisking constantly without including the milky liquid at the bottom.  When all the butter is absorbed the sauce should be the consistency of a medium-thick mayonnaise; whisk in the cream (or water) so it forms soft slowly dissolving peaks.
5. To keep the sauce from congealing set it in a pan of hot tap water but the sooner it is served the better.
6. If the sauce overheats or the butter is added too fast the oily fat can separate out.  If that happens during or after cooking it is easy to fix: Put a teaspoon of water in a small bowl add a spoonful of the separating sauce and whisk them together until creamy; then gradually add the rest of the sauce spoonful by spoonful until the whole thing is reconstituted.,

instructions, 1. Heat the milk and 2 cups water in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the salt and pepper. Just before the liquids start to simmer sprinkle the polenta into the pot slowly while stirring with a whisk. Turn the heat to low and keep whisking the mixture without letting it boil until it thickens and pulls away from the sides of the pan. This will take about 5 minutes if you use quick cooking 30 minutes if yo use stone ground - in the latter case after the first 5 minutes you don't need to whisk it constantly just regularly to keep it from burning. (Be careful: as the polenta cooks the mixture will form burping bubbles that could erupt on your hands).
2. Remove from heat stir in the oil herbes de Provence walnuts and half the cheese (cover the other half and reserve in the fridge for the topping). Grease a large rectangular baking dish with 1 teaspoon oil and pour in the polenta mixture spreading it with a spatula. Press plastic wrap directly on the polenta and refrigerate for an hour or overnight.
3. Preheat the oven to 400°F Line a baking sheet with foil and grease it with 1 teaspoon oil. Use a sharp knife to cut the polenta into squares about 2 by 2 inches (wipe the knife blade when it gets too coated with polenta) and cut each square diagonally to form triangles. Use a spatula- preferably a thin and narrow one- to transfer the triangles onto the baking sheet leaving just a little space between them. Sprinkle with the reserved cheese- don't worry if some of the cheese lands on the foil.
4. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the sides of the triangles get lightly crusty. Switch to broiler setting and broil for 5 minutes until golden keeping an eye on them. Let cool for a minute and use the spatula to loosen and lift the triangles from the foil. Serve immediately or at room temperature.,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2. Pour the can of crushed tomatoes into a small bowl. Finely mince the garlic and toss in with the tomatoes (I like to use my microplane to do this since the garlic won’t burn in the sauce and this way you won’t get large chunks of raw garlic while you eat). Stir in the oregano salt sugar and pepper. Set aside.
3. Prepare the rolls: Cut off just the very top crust of the roll. Use your fingers to pull out the bread from inside the roll creating a bowl. Be careful not to pull too much off from close to the sides and bottom as you don’t want the ingredients to leak out. You will want the sides and bottom to be about ½-3/4” thick. (Toast up the bread you pulled out to use as croutons in a soup or salad to avoid waste!).
4. Heat the cooking oil in a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté for about 2-3 minutes or until tender. Add the ground beef to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Break up the meat as it cooks with a wooden spoon stirring frequently until the meat is no longer pink. Remove from the heat and drain using a metal colander. Set aside.
5. Place the “bread bowls” onto a baking sheet. Spread the bottom of each with a good portion of the sauce. Then divide the ground beef mixture among the rolls (you don’t want these to over flow too much so use less beef if necessary). Layer the mushrooms and the pepperoni on top of the beef. Now top the each bun with the mozzarella cheese. The mixture/cheese should come just barely above the top of the bun as it will sink a little as it cooks.
6. Cook the deep dish pizzas for about 15-20 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbling the bread is slightly toasted and the ingredients are warmed through. Let sit for about 5 minutes before serving.,

instructions, 1. To Make Sweet Tart Pastry:
2. In a food processor place flour almonds sugar and salt. Blend for about 30 seconds to combine. Scatter in the butter cubes and pulse about 10 times until the largest pieces of butter are about the size of a pea. Pour in the egg yolk mixture and continue to pulse about 3 seconds per pulse JUST until the mixture no longer looks dry and small clumps begin to form.
3. Empty into a round 9 inch removable- bottom  tart pan and begin to press the pastry into the tart shell with your fingers evenly pressing it up the sides. You are aiming for about a 1/4 inch thickness.
4. Note: You will have more pastry than you need for this size of pan so remove excess from the edge and freeze for future or in my case I get out my individual tart shells and fill them to freeze for another time. Another option is to roll and cut with cookie cutters sprinkle with sugar and bake along with the tart later sandwiching them with jam.
5. Freeze for 30 minutes or overnight. Preheat oven to between 350F and 375°F Bake in the bottom third of the oven for 25 minutes until shell is golden brown. During the baking if the shell with puffs up in places simply pierce it with a toothpick and it will deflate.
6. Remove from oven and patch any cracks with bits of the reserved dough simply mashing it gently into the hole return to oven for pastry scraps to set. Set aside until filling is made.
7. To Make Filling:
8. Rub together the lemon zest and sugar in a 2 liter saucepan until the oils have combined and the mixture looks slightly wet. Mix in the cornstarch. Add eggs and whisk together well. Whisk in juice and salt place over medium heat and cook stirring constantly. As the mixture warms and starts to thicken a bit speed up your whisking the faster you whisk the lighter the filling will become which is the characteristic of this filling. Increase the heat if necessary being sure to whisk constantly and vigorously.
9. Once the mixture coats the back of a spoon well it is done. Remove from the heat and whisk in the olive oil and butter quickly to cool mixture. Once completely mixed pour into the cooled tart shell. Move the tart shell gently from side to side to get a nice level top or pour in a concentric circle to form a slight decorative pattern in the filling. Refrigerate to set for about 1 hour. Will keep refrigerated for up to 3 days if its around that long.,

instructions, 1. Grill the tomatoes until the skins crack and the tomatoes soften about 10 minutes.  OR place them on a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake at 450* F for 12 minutes.  Allow tomatoes to cool enough to handle core them and coarsely chop them.
2. While the tomatoes are cooling heat the olive oil in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook stirring occasionally until soft about 7 minutes. Stir in the chopped tomatoes chicken broth and sugar. Increase the heat bring to a boil turn the heat to medium and simmer until the soup is reduced by one quarter about 20 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes.
3. Use an immersion blender to puree the bisque.  The recipe suggests straining but I found that mine didn't need it.  Turn off the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Taste and season with salt and pepper. To serve ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with the chopped mint or basil.  Serve with crusty buttered french bread.,
