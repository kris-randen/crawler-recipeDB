instructions, 1. Prepare potatoes then put in a bowl to soak. Fill bowl 3/4 way full until you can see the water coming up and fill the remainder with vinegar. Soak for at least 20 minutes. Turn the potatoes once or twice so that liquid gets on all of them.
2. Drain potatoes. Heat oil on highest heat possible on your stove. Once it's VERY hot (either oil smokes a bit or sizzles when a drop of water touches it) then drop in potatoes.
3. Immediately start to toss potatoes and get them coated. Toss in peppers and garlic. Sprinkle with extra tablespoon of vinegar and salt and keep tossing a few seconds. Take a piece and taste it - adjust salt or splash in a tad bit more vinegar but I don't recommend too much more of either of these.
4. Toss on high heat no longer than 2-3 minutes. If the potatoes start to feel soft or start to glue together - take off heat immediately they are overcooking.
5. Result should be a tender potato dish with a delicious buttery texture and faintly spicy kick to it. The potatoes will be tender yet not soft and mushy a result of soaking them in vinegar. If they are crispy or crunchy at all they either were not cut thinly enough or were not soaked long enough or with enough vinegar.,

9. Curry: I have found the brand Mae Ploy is sold in generous sizes and is very reasonably price (it comes in a 14 oz round cardboard carton which is refrigerated after opening and lasts a LONG time and I paid about $2.50 in an asian market).

instructions, 1. Cook chicken strips until they have an internal temperature of 170 degrees F (using a meat thermometer to test). Set aside. IMPORTANT: don't cook as much as you'd cook a chicken breast you might eat by itself: heating the soup will continue to cook the chicken resulting in tough overcooked chicken in your soup.
2. Dissolve tamarind paste by heating with an ounce of the chicken stock. (microwave is a good way to do this). Remove any seeds from melted paste since they're inedible.
3. If using pickled radish chop as finely as you can make it since they're hard to chew.
4. Bring stock to boil. Add tamarind/stock mixture soy sauce chinkiang vinegar pepper bamboo shoots mushrooms radish and chestnuts; SAVE LIQUID FROM BAMBOO SHOOTS & CHESTNUTS. Stir. Let cook for 3 minutes.
5. While cooking in separate bowl combine cornstarch or flour and liquid from the previous step to make a slurry. Add slurry a little at a time and stir until thick (all slurry may not be necessary so add as much as necessary for desired thickness).
6. Add eggs while stirring and cook for 30 seconds or until eggs are done. Add green onions and chicken.

instructions, 1. If you are making your own stock for this recipe be sure to include the tops and bottoms of the peppers the garlic & onion skins and cut offs the peelings of the ginger and the tough end of the lemon grass.  I also included mushroom stems and skins.
2. Combine the stocks in a large soup pot except for a reserve of about 2 cups.  Bring the stock to a rolling boil.
3. Mix the reserve stock with the corn starch and whisk until smooth.  Whisk the starch mixture into the boiling stock.  Reduce heat to medium.
4. Stir in the diced onion celery garlic and ginger and the carrot julienne.
5. Whack the lemon grass violently with the back (blunt edge) of a heavy knife or the edge of a wooden spoon to start the release of the essential oils.  Add the entire stalk to the pot.
6. Add soy sauce oyster sauce fish sauce and lime juice.  Add the spices and sugar.  Stir well to combine.
7. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about half an hour.  Taste and adjust flavour with spices and sauces as desired.
8. In a seperate bowl mix together sliced peppers and green onions.  Set aside.
9. If necessary cut the beef into one inch thick pieces.  Cut again to make 1 inch by 1 inch by the length of the beef (so you have long squarish strips).  On a slight diagonal and with the sharpest knife you have slice pieces off the end as thinly as you can. (If you place the chunk of beef on brown paper towel on the cutting board it will help keep it from slipping)  You should end up with a pile of very thin rectangle slices.  To get extra-thin slices place the sliced beef on a piece of plastic wrap; fold the plastic wrap over once to 'sandwich' the beef.  Give it a few whacks with a rolling pin or other smooth hard object.
10. Wrap the beef slices in plastic (or leave them in thier plastic 'sandwiches') or a ziplock bag with the air rolled out until ready to serve the soup.
11. To Serve:
12. Put a small handful of the peppers mixture into a bowl.  Ladle the hot soup over the peppers.  Immediately add about five slices of the beef.  (the hot broth will cook the beef to tender deliciousness and leave the peppers somewhat crisp).
13. Add a few drops of sesame oil.

instructions, 1. Mix the marinade ingredients together in a cup except for the ground pepper. Slather over chicken ensuring all parts are equally covered with marinade. Then press coursely-ground peppercorn all over the chicken's surface. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 10 to 15 minutes (or up to 24 hours).
2. If Using the Oven: Set oven to BROIL and place chicken on a broiling pan or a foil-lined baking sheet (turn out the sides of the foil to prevent juices from spilling into oven).
3. Place chicken on second-to-highest rung of your oven allowing it to cook 5 minutes each side then turning. Continue broiling and turning until cooked (chicken will be lightly charred around the edges). Use the leftover marinade to baste chicken the first time you turn it.
4. If Grilling the Chicken: Place chicken over a hot grill and cook until well done. Use leftover marinade to baste chicken when you turn it the first time.
5. While chicken is cooking prepare the salad greens and dressing. To make the dressing: place water lemongrass and lime leaf strips (or zest) in a sauce pan and bring to a boil. Boil for 1 minute (this will soften the lemongrass and bring out the flavor of the lime leaf). Remove from heat.
6. Add the rest of the dressing ingredients and mix well.
7. Taste-test the dressing. It should be tangy - a balance of salty sweet spicy and sour. Adjust it to your taste by adding more fish sauce if not salty enough more lime juice if too salty or sweet more sugar if too sour or more chili sauce if not spicy enough for your taste.
8. Toss the salad with the dressing. Portion out the salad among individual plates and top with strips of the hot chicken. Sprinkle with fresh basil and coriander; serve immediately while chicken is still warm.,

instructions, 1. Heat coconut oil over medium heat—do not let it smoke—and add carrots bell pepper celery and onion.  Saute until crisp-tender.
2. Add all ingredients down to and including tamarind paste: broth broccoli lemongrass potatoes shitakes chick peas ginger fish sauce curry paste soy sauce tamarind paste.
3. Bring to a boil stirring frequently.
4. Reduce heat to simmer: add remaining ingredients and simmer until potatoes are soft.  Do taste tests from time to time.  If the flavor is lacking add more tamarind or soy sauce or fish sauce or more curry paste if you like it HOT!  You are unlikely to need to salt this soup with all those delicious seasonings.  If you don’t like the veggie-to-broth ration add more broth.
5. Remove lemongrass and serve (but put it back in with any leftovers in the fridge; this soup gets better every day).  Put some Sriracha on the table for the hot-sauce devotees.,

instructions, 1. Dressing  --  Just mix the salad dressing soy sauce ginger and red pepper flakes together and refrigerate until ready to serve.
2. Chicken and Pork  --  Now I won't go into particular cooking directions because you can use;  leftovers rotisserie roasted breasts slices of tenderloin;  or you can pan sear a couple of boneless loin chops or chicken breasts in some olive oil with salt and pepper. You need 2 cups total whether you use all chicken or chicken and pork mixed.
3. Salad  --  On a large serving platter mix the lettuce (I like to use all 3 for a nice combination but you can use what you enjoy best). The combination of the crisp romaine soft bibb and the cabbage really makes this salad great. Then toss in the scallions shallot and cilantro.
4. Toppings  --  How I like to present the salad is to put rows of each topping across the top of the salad. It makes it pretty and makes a great way to present the salad. I started with carrots then chicken avocado red pepper pork mango and cucumber. Just pile on the topping in rows and finish by topping with the chopped peanuts.
5. Finish  --  I dress the salad lightly with some of the dressing and always add extra so people can more if needed.
6. It sounds like a lot but really when you think about it. It is the entire main course. And take advantage of the shredded carrots even the bagged lettuce and leftover chicken or pork. That makes this a really nice salad.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven and pizza stone to 550* (or as high as your oven will go may only be 500*).
2. Prepare your dough to top.  You can prebake your crust for a minute or two after brushing with olive oil or you can do as I do and just top the dough since I bake at such a high heat.
3. Brush crust with olive oil.  Spread on Thai Sweet Chili Sauce as thick or thinly as you like.  (It is very sweet with just a hint of heat I happen to love sweet and savory together so I use a lot and add a pinch or two or crushed chili flakes).
4. Layer on italian cheese and half of the cheddar.  Add veggies chicken remaining cheddar.  Sprinkle on sesame seeds allowing some to get on the untopped crust as well.
5. Working quickly so as not to let the oven temperature drop transfer pizza to pizza stone using a pizza peel cookie sheet or parchment paper.
6. Bake for 8-10 minutes depending on the amount of toppings you added and how done you like your crust.  If you have never baked a pizza at this high of heat before you should DEFINITELY watch it like a hawk the first few times so you don't burn it.  I have been told (and agree) that the high heat gives you more of a pizzaria-style pie!
7. Remove from oven and allow to cool for a minute.  Drizzle with siracha and sprinkle with cilantro if desired.,

18. NOTES:
19. 1) The original recipe (and now modified to my taste) was from the book “Marion: Recipes and stories from a hungry cook” by Marion Grasby based in Australia.
20. 2) I was not very successful in making a rounded and somewhat deep birds nest --  but resulted in one that was just noodles bunched together. So perhaps you will have better success in making a better birds nest -- .
21. 3) You can also add a pinch of Bijol (brand name optional) food coloring to enhance the color of the coconut soup.,

instructions, 1. Set up a wrapping 'station'. Have a large baking dish (big enough to completely submerge a rice paper sheet) filled with warm water.
2. Next to that have your package of rice paper then your fruit then your large plate paper towels or a kitchen towel then serving plate covered with plastic wrap.
3. Place one rice paper sheet into water and press down softly to cover. Allow to sit 1 minute then pull out gently- don't tear it! Place it flat down on plate and place slices of banana and strawberry at the bottom corner.
4. Fold up corner then fold over. Wrap in the sides then roll all the way up. It should look like a small egg roll. Best is 4 slices banana and a little over half a strawberry per roll.
5. Its better to under fill than to overfill as the paper will tear. Place on your serving plate and cover with the plastic wrap.
6. Wipe off your rolling plate and repeat with remaining sheets and fruit placing under plastic wrap after each one to keep from drying out.
7. After all wraps are used up uncover rolls and (with a very sharp knife) cut each in half on the diagonal. Arrange attractively on a serving plate and divide soy yogurt between 4 small dipping bowls (1 for each person). Garnish with a drizzle of sauce and a sprig of mint.
8. variations:
9. * Try serving this on Asian plates with small dipping sauce bowls to match and eating with chopsticks.
10. * Great with any fruit you would like. Great ones to try: Peaches Pineapple Coconut shreds small Apple chunks chopped Cherries Mandarin orange segments (patted dry first) Mango papaya pear etc.
11. * A great sauce to try drizzled on bananas inside the roll: vegan chocolate melted with a bit of peanut butter- its very easy to make these look elegant and taste delicious!
12. * Try any dipping sauce you'd like. Blended fruit and applesauce is great all different types of soy yogurt work and a creamy dip made with coconut milk or coconut cream. (You can find it in Asian food stores in powdered form.) Shredded coconut flavoring (like vanilla or almond extract ginger or cinnamon) and vegan sugar or syrup simmered down is wonderful. Serve all the sauces cold and thick!,

2. Cut the ends off the eggplant then cut the eggplant lengthwise.
3. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and lay the eggplant pieces cut-side-down on the sheet; bake the eggplant in the oven for 45 minutes.
4. While eggplant is baking grate half of the onion (you want the grated texture and intense flavor of the onion juice without the chopped texture) and chop the other half.
5. When the eggplant is done take one half and simply scoop out the soft inner parts; the other half you want to cut into chunky cubes (you can leave the peel on or not- it's up to you- but I removed it); turn off the oven.
6. In a food processor put half of the white beans half of the chopped basil the chopped onion (not the grated half) the garlic half of the chopped scallions and the half of the eggplant that you scooped out; whir the mixture until it is smooth.
7. Put the processed mixture in a crockpot and add the remaining ingredients (including the other half of the divided items) and heat on low for 2 hours; alternately you could simmer it on the stove for 30 minutes.
8. This is a very rich-tasting soup so smallish servings can be a good idea.,

instructions, 1. Preparation.
2. Approximate time: 10 mins.
3. Cut the stems off the cilantro. Chop into small pieces and set aside.  Wash the leaves. Set aside 80% of the leaves which will later be added to the soup. The other 20% you can set aside for a garnish. Cut the chicken into thin slices that will cook easily.  About 2 by 1 (inches). Set aside.
4. Take the hard exterior off the lemon grass.  Cut it once lengthwise. (Do not cut it into small pieces as you will be removing these before serving). Set aside.
5. Grate the outside of your two limes and save the zest for later.  Roll the limes with the palm of your hands to loosen the juices.  Squeeze into a bowl and save for later.  Also save the lime leaves if you have them (these are often hard to find).
6. Grate the frozen ginger and set aside.
7. Julienne the carrots into thin slices. See a one minute tutorial here.  Or if you have a spiralizer you are also use that.
8. Now that you've prepare all your ingredients you will find the actual cooking part much less stressful!
9. Tips For Trying New Recipes:
10. Read the recipe ALL the way through before starting.
11. We craft our recipes with PREP first because it's easier for you but most recipes don't come that way.  You do NOT want to be reading the recipe for the first time while you cook because often the steps are not sequential.  Steps that require the most preparation time can sneak up on you .  This is especially inconvenient when your attention needs to be on timing things if you have already started cooking.
12. Your goal is to mimic a cooking show and have all those little bowls with the ingredients pre-measured vegetables pre-washed chopped and ready to go.  This will make it easier to focus on the timing and when to add which ingredients.  Not to mention it makes keeping your kitchen clean a breeze.
13. The golden rule:  everything that can be done beforehand should be.
14. Instructions.
15. A can of coconut milk has a top layer of cream and a bottom layer of liquid.  Scoop the thick coconut cream from the top of just one of the cans into a large stockpot set over a medium-high heat.  Melt the cream add the curry paste and stir for a few minutes until they begin to sizzle.
16. Add the cilantro roots and chicken and sauté until the chicken is cooked through about 5 minutes.
17. Add the coconut juice from the first can and all the contents of the second and third cans along with the chicken broth carrot lime leaves lemon grass fish sauce ginger and lime zest and juice.  Simmer for 20 minutes or so.
18. Stir in the bean sprouts. Add the rice noodles gently pushing them beneath the surface of the broth. Turn off the heat and let stand until the noodles soften about 3-5 minutes.  Rice noodles just need to soak in the hot water (no cooking required) but you don't want to over cook them so keep an eye on them and use your judgement.
19. Stir in most of the cilantro leaves. Scoop out the lemon grass stalks. Taste and season with a touch more salt (or soy sauce) as needed. Ladle into large bowls and garnish with the green onions and remaining cilantro leaves. Add Sriracha for extra spice.,

10. Rice Noodle Cooking Directions:
11. Place all your rice noodles in a deep mixing bowl trying to snap as few of them as possible as you remove them from the package (always a challenge for us). Bring a good amount of water to boil. Pour the boiling water over the rice noodles until they are completely submerged.
12. Every minute or two give the noodles a stir to loosen them up. When they are completely limp give them a taste to see if they’re cooked through. The thread-like vermicelli noodles used in spring rolls will cook through in just a few minutes. The flat rice noodles might take upwards of ten minutes depending on thickness. Pay attention and test the noodles frequently because they’ll become mushy if they overcook.
13. Once the noodles are tender drain them and run them under cool water to stop the cooking. Toss them with a bit of sesame oil to keep the noodles from sticking to each other if you’re not going to use them right away.
14. Since these noodles will be used in the above dish you definitely want to under-cook them a bit. They will absorb more moisture and cook the rest of the way through once in the stir fry. If your noodles are perfectly cooked to start they will turn to mush in the stir fry.
15. Note:   This whole recipe can be cut in half including the rice noodles.,

instructions, 1. Slice mangos open and scoop out all of the fruit from the skins. Don't forget the fruit around the stone!
2. Place fruit in a food processor or blender. Add sugar and pulse for 1 minute or until all the sugar has dissolved and you are left with a delicious mango puree.
3. Add coconut milk and lemon juice. Pulse briefly to combine. *At this point you can perform an option step as listed below.
4. Pour the mano puree into a bowl or container while you continue to use your processor/blender.
5. Pour the whipping cream into the processor and blitz until the cream forms stiff peaks.
6. Add the mango puree to the whipped cream and blitz 5-10 seconds or until you get a good mango-ceram consistency.
7. Pour into a large yogurt container or similar size tup and place in the freezer.  Allow to freeze at least 6 hours - preferably 8.
8. Serve the mango sorbet in bowls or scoop into ice-cream cones for the kids. (To make scooping easier take the sorbet out of the freezer 10-15 min ahead of serving.) For an adult treat try drizzling a little coconut liquer over sorbet.
9. Optional Step.
10. Some people don't want bits of mango fibre in their sorbet. I actually like it as I find it enhances the taste of the sorbet - plus it's healthy!  But if you'd rather strain it out here's how. Between steps 3 and 4 pour the mango puree through a strainer placed over a bowl. Use a spatual or wooden spoon to press the pulp against the bottom of the strainer in order to "wring out" every ounce of mango juice. Continue on with steps 4/5.,

instructions, 1. Start by very finely chopping the mushrooms and aubergine so they’re about ½ centimetre cubed. Fry them in a wok or pan with a little vegetable and 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce until they are soft all the way through. Don’t be tempted to add any more liquid you need them to be dry so they don’t make the burgers soggy. When they are done set them aside to cool.
2. Prepare all of your other ingredients: Finely pound the cashews in a food processor or mortar and pestle – you should have a fine powder with a few lumps for texture. Chop the tofu into small pieces about the same size as the aubergines and mushrooms. Finely grate the carrot. Finely chop the onion garlic chilli coriander ginger lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves. Take time to do this properly – large chunks won’t be pleasant. The lemongrass and lime leaves are particularly tough and you should chop these as finely as you can. For the chillies leave the seeds in (finely chopped) if you want them spicy remove if not.
3. Combine all of the burger ingredients into a large bowl and combine with your hands. Then divide the mixture into six and form into large patties. It should be a nice firm mixture but if not add a few more breadcrumbs and a bit more flour.
4. Heat a frying pan or griddle pan with a little oil over a medium heat and gently place the burgers in the pan. After 3-4 minutes turn over and cook for 3-4 minutes on both sides. Turn over again and cook for another 2 minutes on each side.
5. Serve in the buns with the sauces and other garnishes.
6. Cooking ahead? You can make these a day in advance and keep them in the fridge or well ahead and freeze defrosting several hours before cooking.,

instructions, 1. NOTE re: chili paste:  Look in the international food aisle; there are now several brands of Thai chili paste with garlic available.
2. NOTE re: spaghetti:  You can use spaghetti or angel hair pasta or rice noodles or anything you like.  I use whole wheat spaghetti.
3. TO MAKE SAUCE:  Place peanut butter in medium-sized bowl.  With fork stir in soy sauce tomato sauce/puree sherry lime zest lime juice brown sugar and chili paste.
4. Heat oil in small saucepan over medium heat.  Add the garlic and cook 1 minute.  Stir in the peanut sauce and keep warm over low heat.  Do not let the sauce simmer (or heavens forbid boil -- it will be too thick to use. Just keep it warm.  (You can also prepare the sauce a few hours in advance and reheat it.).
5. Combine the vegetables and peanuts in a bowl and set aside.
6. Cook your pasta of choice according to directions.  After draining place in large bowl.  Pour the sauce on the noodles and toss.  Sprinkle the vegetables across the top and mix lightly.  Serve immediately.
7. You can add cooked chicken or shrimp or any other combination of vegetables you like.,

instructions, 1. In a small saucepan over high heat combine the ¼ cup water and sugar.  Stir frequently heating just until the sugar is dissolved and the water is clear about 2 minutes. Transfer to a blender.
2. Using kitchen scissors hold a few lemongrass leaves at a time over a large bowl and cut them crosswise into 2-inch lengths.  Or use a sharp knife placing a few leaves at a time on your cutting board and cutting them crosswise into 2-inch strips.
3. Measure out about 2 cups of the leaves loosely packed.  Add the leaves to the blender along with the 3 cups cold water.
4. Blend at high speed for 1 to 2 minutes stopping occasionally to stir up the leaves from around the blade.  When the water is bright green and foamy and the leaves are shredded into fine sharp pieces strain the liquid through a fine sieve into a large bowl or pitcher.  Scoop off the foam with a spoon and discard it.
5. Serve in a tall glass over ice.  Chilled the cooler will keep for 1 to 2 days but it tastes best freshly made.,

instructions, 1. This is written to chop as you go but if that makes you nervous or you don't think you can work quickly enough just chop everything first. I'll bet you can do it the second time you make this though. Again this makes a LOT of food so you'll need a big wok or cook pot or cut the quantities in half.
2. Put your rice on so it's cooking while you work. Follow the directions on the bag and set a timer if you have one because you'll be distracted. It'll be done before the food is ready but will stay plenty hot enough to serve.
3. Start with the carrots and potatoes; slice them fairly thin and saute them in the oil and 1/3 tin of curry paste on medium-high heat for five minutes. Cover and go to the next step.
4. Cut the eggplant into bite-sized cubes. You can peel the eggplant if you want but I think both texture and flavor is better if you leave the skin on. Add to the pan; saute stirring occasionally another five minutes. Cover and go on to the next step.
5. Slice the onion and bell pepper into fairly thin strips and add them to the pan; saute stirring occasionally another five minutes. Cover and go to the next step.
6. Cut the zucchini into bite-size pieces and add to the pan. Strip the basil leaves off their stems and add them too. Stir and cover. Just one more step and you're done.
7. Get a blender out and blend the can of coconut milk with one can full of chicken broth and the second 1/3 of red curry paste. Take a good long whiff of it. WOW! Remember to sneeze away from the food. Call one of your family in to smell it and laugh as they experience the same thing you just did but not in a mean way so they won't get mad when you then ask them to set the table for you while you finish up. Get excited about how awesome this is going to be.
8. Add the coconut/chicken/curry liquid to the pan and let it come to a simmer. Once it's simmering you can check a potato or a carrot for doneness; they should be tender. Dinner's ready!
9. Serve in a bowl over steaming white rice and a box of Kleenex on the table because you're probably going to need it. Jasmine rice really is preferable for this. If you serve this worthy food over instant rice I swear I'll drive over there and whup you myself. Instant rice is an abomination in the eyes of the Lord.,

instructions, 1. In a small sauté pan toast the coriander and cumin seeds over medium heat until aromatic 2 to 3 minutes. Shake the pan frequently to keep the seeds from burning on any sides. Remove from heat and grind the seeds along with the cardamom seeds in a spice grinder coffee mill or using a mortar and pestle.

instructions, 1. Disolve 1/8 cup salt and 1/4 cup sugar in 1 quart of water in a glass or plastic container.  Cut your meat into bite-sized pieces place in the brine cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.  (Pork should be trimmed of silverskin and de-boned.  We like using boneless country-style ribs.) (Chicken should be boneless-skinless breast or thigh meat.).
2. Drain meat and allow to dry on paper towels.
3. In a large pan bring plenty of salted water to boiling.  Add noodles and cook according to directions.
4. In a small bowl whisk together peanut butter coconut milk lime juice soy sauce brown sugar sambal oolek and sweet chile sauce until smooth.  Warm in heavy bottomed pan on stove but do not cook!  Heat to no more than steaming or the sauce might break.  (In my personal experience this sauce doesn't hold well for much more than 20 minutes.  It's best to finish and serve immediately.).
5. In a wok or large heavy skillet heat 1 Tbls oil on medium-high (or if you're confident with stir-fry high) heat until the oil just starts to smoke.  Immediately add your meat stirring constantly until the meat is almost done.  Add the garlic and continue cooking about a minute.  Remove the meat from the pan and allow to drain.
6. Add the other 1 Tbls oil to the wok and add the veggies in the following order: red onion carrot (optional) celery broccoli snow peas red bell pepper (optional) scallion (also optional).  If you like you can add other favorite Asian-style vegetables such as water chestnuts or bamboo shoots but I would avoid mushrooms.  Stir very frequently waiting 30 seconds (for the more tender veggies)  to 2 minutes (for the firmer bits) between additions.  Just before the veggies are ready to be served add the meat and stir for just long enough to reheat thoroughly.
7. Serve by putting the meat & veggie mix over the noodles and top with a healthy spooning of peanut sauce.  Serve hot.,

3. Toss in the shrimp and cook for about 8 minutes until they turn pink.
4. Remove from the heat and add the lime juice green onions and basil (or cilantro).

instructions, 1. Peel potatoes boil them partly in a cooking pot for 10-15 minutes and cut in 1 to 2-inch pieces.
2. Allow the coconut milk to separate and you will have about two cups of thick "cream" and one cup of
3. thin "milk". In a small saucepan bring the milk to a simmer and add the chicken or pork. If you are
4. using beef you will need another two cups of milk. Simmer the meat until it begins to become tender
5. (beef takes longer hence the additional milk).
6. Put the coconut cream in a wok and bring to a boil add the massaman paste and "stir fry" until the
7. flavor is brought out and maximized. Add the remaining cream and curry paste to the meat.
8. Add the peanuts. Taste and adjust the flavor until it is (just) sweet (by adding sugar) sour and salty
9. (by adding tamarind juice lime juice and fish sauce).
10. Add the remaining ingredients and cook until cooked.
11. Note : the potatoes used in Thailand for this dish are a yellow fleshed sweet potato of the type sometimes
12. called a yam in the US. Western style potatoes can be used but absorb less of the sauce and flavor.
13. The potatoes act as a "moderator" to reduce the heat of the curry and should not be left out.
14. You can either serve it on a bed of Thai jasmine rice or double the amount of potato and serve it alone.,

2. Stir in the curry paste mixing well and continue sautéing 3 - 4 more minutes.
3. Add coconut milk mixing well (coconut milk often separates in the can) and then add tomatoes and their juice sugar and cream.
4. Add 1/4 cup lime juice and check for taste.  Add more if needed.
5. Break the lemongrass at several points along the stem and add to mixture. Don't worry if it does not break completely: you're just trying to release its juices.  Add salt and pepper to taste and bring to a boil.  Reduce to simmer and allow to cook 30 minutes stirring occasionally.
6. Meanwhile first peel and then devein the shrimp.  To devein use a small sharp knife to slice open the back of the shrimp (the side without legs) to expose a black stringy vein.  A paper towel in hand does an excellent job of grabbing the vein in one piece out of the slippery shrimp.  Rinse cleaned shrimp in cold water and drain.  Pat dry.  Discard shells and veins and wash hands and equipment thoroughly.
7. Heat the remaining oil in another skillet until hot but not smoking.  Add the shrimp in one layer about 1 minute per side until just pink.  Shrimp are very easy to overcook.  Remove from heat.
8. Remove lemongrass and add sauce to shrimp.  Serve over hot rice garnished with fresh parsley.,

instructions, 1. First make the curry sauce by placing all sauce ingredients together in your food processor or blender. OR you can also mince the ingredients by hand or pound dry ingredients together with a pestle & mortar. Also preheat your oven to 375 degrees.
2. Process ingredients well to make the yellow curry sauce. OR mince ingredients by hand and stir together well by hand in a large mixing bowl.
3. Place chicken pieces in a casserole dish. Add the curry sauce you just made. Also add the kaffir lime leaves (left whole) or bay leaf. Stir together well then cover and bake at 375 degrees for 45 minutes. Note: if you prefer more curry sauce add 1/4 cup good-tasting chicken stock and stir inches.
4. Remove dish from oven and add the potatoes bell pepper and cherry tomatoes. Stir well then return to the oven and bake for an additional 20 minutes (or until chicken and potatoes are well cooked). Note: if you prefer your tomatoes to taste fresh rather than cooked: add them right before serving. The heat from the sauce will warm and soften them just enough to taste great.
5. Remove curry from the oven. Stir then do a taste-test adding more fish sauce if not salty enough. If too salty for your taste add a little more lime juice. Add additional fresh chilies if you prefer more spice. If it's too spicy for your taste add a little more coconut milk or plain yogurt. If too sour add a little more brown sugar. When you're happy with the taste portion the curry out onto serving plates and top with fresh coriander and/or basil. Serve with Thai jasmine-scented rice and ENJOY!,

instructions, 1. Put the steak and water in a pan and bring to the boil.  Lower the heat cover and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is tender.
2. To make the curry paste:  Put the chilies in a pan with the pepper coriander cumin lemon grass cinnamon cardamom and nutmeg.  Cook over low heat until the mixture browns stirring constantly.  Transfer to a mortar and pound to a smooth paste.  Add the remaining ingredients and pound the mixture until smooth.
3. Remove the meat from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.  Add the coconut cream (coconut milk) to the liquid in the pan and heat gently stirring frequently.  Add the peanuts and a little nam pla.  Boil the liquid until reduced in volume by one third.  Add the prepared curry paste and simmer for about 5 minutes stirring constantly.
4. Return the meat to the pan and cover with a tight fitting lid.  Bring back to the boil and continue cooking until the meat is very tender.  Add the tamarind water with coconut sugar and nam pla to taste.  Serve hot.  Serves 6.
5. NOTE:  Tamarind.Also known as asam or assem.  An acid flavoured fruit resembling a bean pod.  Sold as dried tamarind pulp in blocks and is dark brown in colour.  The dried tamarind pulp must be made into tamarind water before using:-Soak about 1 ounce tamarind pulp in 1 1/4 cups water for 5 to 10 minutes then squeeze strain and use the water.  The longer left to soak the stronger the flavour.
6. Lime lemon or mango juice or vinegar may be used as substitutes but the flavour of the finished dish but will not be the same.  Tamarind paste should be refrigerated once opened in which case it will keep indefinitely.  Both tamarind pulp and tamarind paste are available at Asian stores.
7. Terasi.Also known as balachan/blacan (Malaysian) Kapi (Thailand) and ngapi (Burma).  A kind of pungent shrimp paste used in very small quantities.
8. Coconut sugar.Also known as palm sugar. Brown sugar may be substituted.
9. Nam pla is Thailand fish sauce.
10. Lemon grass fresh lemon grass is available from Asian stores.  The lower third of the stalk the bulb like portion is the part to use when a recipe specifies ‘chopped or sliced lemon grass’.  Alternatively the whole stalk may be bruised and added during cooking but then it should be removed before serving.  Dried lemon grass is a good substitute:--Soak in hot water for about 2 hours before using then remove from the dish before serving.  1 Tablespoon dried lemon grass is roughly equivalent to 1 stalk fresh.  Powdered lemon grass is also available.

instructions, 1. Tips: If done in a 2+ quart microwavable casserole with a lid you can go from start to table really quickly easily and with minimal cleanup. To speed things up even further make your sauces and prep your fruit while your rice is soaking/cooking. Be sure to use glutinous rice which can be found at Asian markets. It will be labeled "glutinous rice" and/or "sweet rice". Good ripe mangoes are a MUST so be sure you can find them first before you go any further.
2. Soak raw rice in plenty of water for 30 minutes. Rinse the rice by stirring it with your fingers draining and refilling with water.  Stir-drain-refill a couple or three times then finally drain most of the water away until the rice is covered by about a quarter inch of water. Microwave on high covered for ten minutes.
3. Shake a 13.5 ounce can of coconut milk well before opening then divide in half: pour one half into a bowl or tall glass to make the rice sauce and keep the other half in the can to make the cream sauce. Or the other way 'round it doesn't matter :-).
4. Rice sauce: Stir a cup of sugar and pinch of salt into the coconut milk until dissolved. Pour *most* of the mixture over the cooked rice and stir gently but thoroughly to blend (I feel that this makes a little too much sauce so I use about 3/4 of it and discard the remainder.)  The rice/sauce mixture will be soupy while hot but will firm up well once cooled. If you want to add mango chunks to the whole dish now is the time to stir them inches If you want to make individual serving cups set them up now and chill to firm.
5. Cream sauce: Stir the corn starch salt and sugar into the other half can of coconut milk. Heat in a sauce pan uncovered on the stove top until bubbling stirring frequently to avoid scorching.
6. Serving notes: This makes a glorious platter with the fruit arranged around a big mound of rice with the cream sauce drizzled over the top or you can fancy it up by presenting individual dishes. If I'm making this for a party I serve it in the same covered casserole dish that I cooked it in stirring the mango chunks into the rice and offering the cream sauce on the side. That way everyone gets plenty of mango and sauce instead of just the first guests. However you choose to serve it it's a hit.,

instructions, 1. PREPARE THE CURRY PASTE:  Wrap the shallots garlic ginger and jalapenos in a sheet of aluminum foil sealing well to make a flat package.  Place the package directly on a gas or electric burner set at moderate heat and cook until fragrant about 1 minute on each side turning with tongs.  Allow to cool then unwrap and transfer the contents to a spice grinder or blender.  Add the curry powder cumin and anchovy and process to a fine paste.
2. Heat the oil in a small skillet or frying pan over moderate heat and stir fry the paste until well browned about 3 minutes.  Stir in the sugar and fish sauce blending well. Set aside to cool.  NOTE:  When buying fish sauce look for the Squid or Tiparos brand.
3. NOTE:  The curry paste can be made in larger quantities.  (This recipe makes about 1/3 cup.)  Use it to enhance other curried dishes.  To store put the curry paste in a glass jar.  Add just enough peanut oil or vegetable oil to cover.  Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 months.  Do not freeze; the paste will lose its aroma.
4. PREPARE THE EGGPLANTS:  Prick the skins of the eggplants in several places with a fork.  Place the eggplants directly on a gas or electric burner set at moderate heat and grill turning with tongs until the flesh is soft and the skin charred about 4 minutes.  Remove to a rack and allow to cool.  Peel off and discard the charred skin.  The eggplant flesh should be just cooked but still firm.  Cut the eggplant into ½ inch cubes.  Put the cubes in a bowl and set aside.  NOTE:  If you can’t find  the thin long Japanese eggplants choose a large purple eggplant and allow 12 minutes to cook it.
5. MAKE THE FILLING:  Heat the oil in a small skillet over moderate heat.  Add the shrimp and stir fry for 30 seconds.  Add the eggplant and 2 ½ tablespoons of the curry paste and stir with a wooden spoon to mix about 30 seconds.  Add the basil and salt to taste and remove from the heat.  Allow to cool.
6. Lightly butter a large baking sheet.
7. Work with one sheet of phyllo at a time keeping the remaining leaves covered with a slightly damp kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out.
8. ASSEMBLE THE TURNOVERS:  Working quickly place a sheet of phyllo on a work surface with a long side toward you.  Lightly brush the sheet with melted butter and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the shredded coconut.  Fold the sheet crosswise in half.  Brush with butter and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of the coconut.  Fold the sheet lengthwise in half.  You will have a 4 layer strip about 4 by 12 inches.  Lightly brush the strip with melted butter.
9. Place ¼ cup of the filling on the bottom left hand corner of the strip.  Fold bottom right corner of the pyllo strip diagonally over the filling so that the short edge meets the long edge of the strip forming a triangular point.  Continue folding up the triangle over itself to form a triangular package.  Brush the triangle with butter and place it seam side down on the prepared baking sheet.  Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the shredded coconut  over the triangle.  Repeat the assembly with the remaining phyllo sheets and filling.  Cover and set aside until ready to bake.
10. MAKE THE SAUCE:  Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Lower the heat to moderately high and gently boil until reduced to 1 cup about 15 minutes.  Add the cream coconut milk and 1 ½ tablespoons of the curry paste and blend well with a whisk.  (Save the remaining curry paste for other uses.)  Continue cooking until the sauce is reduced to about 1 cup and has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon about 15 minutes.  The sauce may appear curdled; this is natural don’t worry.  Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a small saucepan.  Cover  and set aside.  NOTE:  Do not confuse coconut milk with coconut cream.  Excellent canned unsweetened coconut milk is available in Asian markets and some supermarkets.  After opening it can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.  For longer storage freeze it in ice cube trays then store the cubes in plastic bags.  Before using heat the frozen coconut milk until completely melted.  Four cubes equal about ½ cup.  You may substitute heavy cream for the coconut milk but the taste will be slightly altered.
11. Preheat the oven to 375°F  Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position.  Bake the turnovers until crisp and golden brown about 20 minutes.  Let cool slightly.
12. TO SERVE:  gently reheat the sauce and divide it among four preheated plates.  Arrange 2 turnovers on each plate and garnish with shredded basil.  Yield 8 turnovers enough  for 8 first course or 4 main course servings.

instructions, 1. Heat grill to high with cover closed till you hit about 400 degrees. Toss wings in a few tablespoons of oil and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Place on the grill in single layers and grill until golden brown on both sides about 10 to 12 minutes per side.
2. (For those that are not too familiar with grilling preheating your grill to 400 degrees is a great way to clean your grill before cooking a new item. Simply wait till your covered grill hits 400 degrees and then using a grill cleaning brush scrub off the chard left overs. Heating your grill up to 400 degrees also creates in my opinion the best heat to start off your grilling as you'll for the most part not want to cover your grill again through out the cooking process. It's also equally as important to watch your wings to make sure your wings aren't being overly chard on the outside this just comes with practice!).
3. Puree the Chipotle peppers in a processor with the adobe sauce that they usually come with. You can buy these Chipotle peppers with adobe sauce in almost any large market. For this recipe you'll only need to buy the smallest can since this recipe only calls for about 2 to 3 tablespoons worth.
4. On a medium heat setting on your stove combine together the vinegar orange juice Dijon mustard chipotle puree honey oil and peanut butter in a medium sauce pan. Season with salt and pepper to taste. After cooking the mixture on medium for 5 mins reduce (allow sauce to thicken) this mixture on a low to medium heat setting for about 10 mins stirring occasionally. (meaning you'll need to have the sauce pan uncovered during the whole processes to allow the moisture to escape).
5. Pour the hot sauce mixture into a large wok or a large pot and bring to a boil(About medium to high stove setting should do the trick). Add the wings in batches (about ten wings depending on how large your wok or pot is) and coat for about 2 minutes making sure that the wings are well coated. Once done plate them and enjoy!,

Alternatively the whole stalk may be bruised and added during cooking but then it should be removed before serving.  Dried lemon grass is a good substitute:--Soak in hot water for about 2 hours before using then remove from the dish before serving.  1 Tablespoon dried lemon grass is roughly equivalent to 1 stalk fresh.  Powdered lemon grass is also available.
7. Lime leaves fresh lime leaves are preferred but virtually unobtainable in the West.  Dried lime leaves are available from Asian stores.

Pour a half cup of the lentil mixture onto the pan and gently spread the mixture into the shape of a mini-pancake.  Repeat with other patties ensuring to not overcrowd the pan so that you can turn over the patties more easily.
5. Cook the patties on one side until the edges have crisped up and the patties themselves have attained a golden brown colour.  Turn the patties over onto the other side and cook until the patties have cooked and are golden brown.  You can use paper towel to remove any excess oil if required.
6. Transfer to a serving dish and serve hot with mango chutney or any other condiment.
7. It is also common to add an egg topping or a minced meat topping or whatever toppings you desire.
8. For convenience an alternative to cooking your baras in a pan is using a waffle machine.  For this heat up your waffle machine and using oil spray coat the top and bottom surfaces.  Pour a half cup of the lentil mixture on the bottom surface gently spread out the mixture and close the lid to cook.  Cook until the lentil patty is cooked and has attained a golden brown colour approximately 5-7 minutes.  Baking is another healthy way to cook baras.,

2. In a large bowl combine all filling ingredients. Mix well and adjust for seasoning with salt.
3. Give the dough a final knead. Prepare 1 inch dough balls. Take a ball and roll between your palms to spherical shape. Dust working board with dry flour. On the board gently flatten circles cover with a bowl. Use a rolling pin to roll out each flattened circle into a wrapper.
4. NOTE: For well executed momos it is essential that the middle portion of the wrapper be slightly thicker than the edges to ensure the structural integrity of dumplings during packing and steaming.
5. Hold the edges of the semi-flattened dough with one hand and with the other begin rolling the edges of the dough flour swirling a bit at a time. Continue until the wrapper attains 3 inches in diameter (circular shape). Repeat with the remaining semi-flattened dough circles. Cover with bowl to prevent from drying.
6. For packing hold wrapper on one palm put one tablespoon of filling mixture and with the other hand bring all edges together to the center making the pleats. Pinch and twist the pleats to ensure the absolute closure of the stuffed dumpling. This holds the key to a good tasting juicy dumpling.
7. Heat up a steamer oil the steamer rack well. This is critical because it will prevent dumplings from sticking. Arrange uncooked momos in the steamer. Close the lid and allow steaming until the dumplings are cooked through; it takes about 20-25 minutes.

instructions, 1. Place the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse briefly to mix. With the blade running slowly add the water through the feed tube until a ball forms. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. The dough should be soft and elastic. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rest for 30 minutes to 2 hours whatever is most convenient.
2. Mix together cheese and scallions in medium bowl. Set aside.
3. Cut the dough in half. Set one half aside covered. On a lightly floured surface shape the other half into a cylinder by rolling it under your palms. Cut the cylinder crosswise in half then in half and half again to give you 8 equal pieces. Work with one piece at a time leaving the others loosely covered with plastic wrap.
4. On the lightly floured surface roll one piece out to a nearly 5-inch round. Place 1 packed tablespoon of the cheese mixture in the center of the round and fold over to make a half-moon shape. Press down lightly with a floured palm to get rid of air bubbles then pleat the edges closed.
5. Start at one end and pinch the edges together between thumb and forefinger then twist the place over rolling the edge. Move along about ¼ inch and repeat then continue until the edge is completely sealed. If the dough is not sticking to itself brush off excess flour and brush the edge with a very little water. Set aside on a lightly floured surface and repeat with the remaining 7 pieces of dough and then with the remaining dough and cheese.
6. Place a large wok or deep heavy pot on stovetop making sure it's stable. (Or use a deep-fryer.) Pour 2 inches of oil into the wok or pot and heat over high heat. To check temperature of the oil hold a wooden chopstick vertically in the oil with the end touching the bottom of the pot. If bubbles bubble up along the chopstick the oil is the right temperature. The oil should not be smoking.
7. When the oil is ready slide one momo into the hot oil. Add another and repeat until you have 4 frying at once. If pot is small stop before pot is crowded. Use a slotted spoon or wire skimmer to move the momos around and gently turn them. They will quickly turn golden brown with darker brown bubbled spots.
8. After 1-2 minutes when they are a rich golden brown and crisped looking use the slotted spoon or skimmer to transfer to a rack or plate lined with paper towels. Repeat with the remaining momos.

instructions, 1. For dough: mix water and flour with a wooden spoon. when well mixed knead until it becomes a firm elastic dough quite flexible. VERY IMPORTANT: keep dough in airtight container until ready to use so it DOES NOT DRY OUT.
2. For filling: mix beef bouillon and soy sauce with hands until well combined. set aside.
3. Turn out dough onto floured surface and roll out slightly thinner than a floppy disk.
4. Personally I use a coffee mug to cut out circles of dough but you can use a 3-4" cookie cutter if you like. Cut out a circle of dough and place 1Tblsp. of meat filling into circle. Fold in half lengthwise and seal. (You may do different pinches and folds to make it look prettier if you like).
5. Repeat with rest of momo's. (cover with a damp cloth so they dont dry out before steaming.)
6. To steam you can use either a steamer or a skillet . If using skillet Line the bottom of the pan with cabbage leaves to prevent dough sticking on metal.
7. fill with enough water to steam dumplings. If using steamer lightly oil before steaming. Steam for 10 minutes.

instructions, 1. I use 1/2 cup unpopped corn kernels to make about 8 to 10 cups of popped corn in my air-popper. I use a LARGE plastic bowl to pop into.
2. In a microwave safe cup put the peanut butter ( I use "Better than Peanut Butter" with mine. It's half the calories and like 75% less fat. It's too sweet in my opinion for PB&J sammies but it is really great in this!).
3. Add sambal (add more if you like it spicier or less if you're a wimp) to the peanut butter along with enough water (teeny bit!) to thin the peanut butter not too runny though! Should be a creamy and thick. Stir with a table knife not a fork.
4. Microwave the cup of P. Butter and Sambal for about 30 seconds.
5. With rubber gloved hands (Hot!) gently fold the P. butter mixture onto the popcorn. It's messy and sticky and it seems impossible without crushing all the popcorn but trust me it does work. Just keep grabbing some in your hand and working it through the popcorn GENTLY. Remember work it into popcorn in the bottom of bowl too.
6. As it cools it turns into little clusters of popcorn-ball like sticky sweet spicy yumminess!
7. A nice cold beer goes great with this!,

instructions, 1. Place an empty tall beer type  glass in the freezer for an hour to chill.
2. In a small saucepan heat the sriracha sesame oil broth and agar over medium-low heat until it comes to a small simmer. After 45 seconds remove from the heat and allow to cool for a minute or two.
3. Remove the chilled oil and empty glass from the freezer. Place the cold oil into the glass so only and inch of two of space is left at the top. Using a pipette squeeze bottle or syringe suck up a tablespoon or two of the mixture. Keeping the dropper very close to the oil slowly drop it in and allow the beads to fall to the bottom of the glass. After several beads are created pour the entire glass through a fine mesh strainer into the bowl then return the oil back into the glass and repeat. The pearls can then be rinsed in the strainer and stored in water while you make your tofu.
4. Cut the tofu block into 3 slabs then half those slabs to make 6 large tofu cubes.
5. Heat the peanut oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Place the cubes into the hot pan. They will sputter a bit when they hit the pan. Allow the brown on each side for 4-5 minutes each. You may need to add a little more oil to the pan during browning time if the cubes start to stick. Once they are fully browned transfer them to another plate while you make the glaze.
6. Reduce the heat to medium. Add in the sesame oil soy sauce and mirin. Stir well then add in the vinegar then sprinkle the brown sugar over the top. Add in the water and cornstarch mixture stir until thickened then remove immediately from the heat.
7. Spoon the sauce over the top of the tofu cubes then garnish with the sriracha pearls and sesame seeds. Serve immediately.,

2. Place the chickpeas in a large bowl with 1 teaspoon of the baking soda and cover with plenty of water. (The chickpeas will double in volume so use more water than you think you need.) Soak the chickpeas overnight at room temperature. The next day drain the chickpeas and rinse under cold water.
3. Place the chickpeas in a large pot with the remaining 1 teaspoon baking soda and add cold water to cover by at least 4 inches. Bring the chickpeas to a boil over high heat skimming off any scum that rises to the surface. Lower the heat to medium cover the pot and continue to simmer for about 1 hour until the chickpeas are completely tender. Then simmer them a little more. (The secret to creamy hummus is overcooked chickpeas; don't worry if they are mushy and falling apart a little.) Drain.
4. Combine the chickpeas tehina sauce salt and cumin in a food processor. Puree the hummus for several minutes until it is smooth and uber-creamy. Then puree it some more!
5. To serve spread the hummus in a shallow bowl dust with paprika top with parsley and more tehina sauce if you like and drizzle generously with oil.,

instructions, 1. Dissolve the honey in 1-1/2 cups luke-warm water. Using a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook mix the flour 1-1/2 teaspoons of the salt and the yeast on low speed for 2 minutes. With the mixer running gradually add the honey water and the olive oil. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is smooth yet slightly tacky to the touch about 5 minutes. If the dough seems too wet add more flour 1 teaspoons at a time. Return to low speed and mix for 2 minutes more.
2. Let the dough rest in the bowl for 5 minutes and then turn the mixer to medium-high speed and mix for 3 minutes more as the dough vigorously slaps against the side of the bowl.
3. Lightly oil a large bowl. Transfer the dough to the bowl and turn the dough to coat it with the oil. Cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size 1 to 1-1/2 hours.
4. Using a mortar and pestle coarsely grind the cumin coriander and the remaining 3/4 teaspoons salt. Set aside.
5. Cut the onion in half crosswise. Heat a cast-iron griddle or a small cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot. Put the onion halves cut side down on the hot surface and cook until just charred 5 to 7 minutes. Cool slightly and then remove the skin and chop finely. Put the onion in a medium bowl and stir in the chickpeas and about two-thirds of the spice mixture. With lightly floured hands gently deflate the dough. Add the chickpea mixture to the top of the dough and using a plastic bowl scraper reach down to the bottom of the bowl and gently fold the dough onto itself 4 times rotating the bowl with each fold to incorporate the mixture. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface stretch slightly to form into a log and cut into 6 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball by gently stretching and tucking the dough underneath itself to form a “belly button” on the bottom. Gently roll in the palm of your hand to reshape into a uniform ball then set each ball belly button side down on a well-floured baking sheet. Lightly brush each top with olive oil. Cover loosely with a towel or plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size about 1 hour.
6. Meanwhile prepare a medium gas grill fire or an indirect charcoal fire with a hot zone and a cool zone (an oven thermometer placed over the hot zone should register about 450°F). Brush the grill grates with a stiff brush then wipe with a lightly oiled paper towel.
7. On a lightly floured surface roll out or press and stretch each piece of dough with your fingertips until about 1/4 inch thick and about 8 inches in diameter. Put the flatbreads on 2 lightly floured baking sheets and lightly brush the tops of the dough with the butter being careful not to get butter on the baking sheet.
8. Put the flatbreads buttered side down on the grill (over the hot zone of the charcoal fire) cover and cook until puffed and good grill marks form 2 to 4 minutes. Flip the flatbreads and turn the burners of a gas grill down to low (or move the breads to the cool zone of the charcoal grill) and brush the grill-marked side with more butter. Cover and finish cooking until the bottoms have good grill marks and the breads are cooked through about 3 minutes more. Transfer the breads to a cutting board brush with more of the butter and dust with the remaining spice mixture. Cut into wedges and serve warm.,

time, ,

instructions, 1. The day before you plan to cook these mix up the marinade ingredients (excluding chicken) in a bowl (use one that will fit all your chicken inside).  Whisk till oil is well incorporated.  Taste and add salt as needed.  When seasoning is correct add chicken and cover.  Refrigerate overnight.  If you're in a hurry (i.e. you're not doing this the night before) let the mixture marinate on the counter for at least 30 minutes before cooking.
2. Also the day before you plan to cook these make the sauce.  Place yogurt in the center of a clean piece of cheesecloth (I use a kitchen towel--it works just as well).  Bring up the sides and twist so that yogurt is all wrapped up in a nice little bundle.  Secure towel and hang yogurt over your sink (I do this at night and just tie the towel around the arm of my faucet).  Let yogurt drain overnight (12-24 hours).  The longer it drains the thicker your sauce will be.  When yogurt has drained to your liking scrape it off the towel/cheesecloth and into a small bowl.  Add lemon juice diced cuke and garlic; mix well.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt if needed (some yogurt brands are saltier than others so you may not need any salt at all).  Let sit for at least 15 minutes before serving so flavors can blend.  This gets better and better the longer it sits!  (Again if you're in a hurry and not doing this the night before just stir everything together for the sauce--it'll be runnier but you'll live!).
3. When you're ready to make the gyros preheat your grill (charcoal is best); meanwhile prep your tomatoes and onion.   Thread chicken onto soaked skewers leaving a little space between each piece.  Cook skewers for a couple minutes on each side turning once till done.
4. When chicken is all cooked throw your pitas on the grill to heat up (and get that smoky/grillly taste!) turning once.  When your pitas are hot (and nice and flexible) take them of the grill.  Working with one pita at a time place pita on foil in your hand.  Lay a skewer down the middle of the pita and curl the pita around the meat with your hand while you pull out the skewer.  Open the pita back up and top with tomato wedges and onion dollop with the sauce then wrap foil around the bottom half of the pita securely (so it won't leak and/or lose any of the filling!).  Eat!
5. These are great fresh but I usually cook extra to have for other meals during the week--keep all the ingredients separate till you're ready to eat then just reheat the chicken and pitas in the microwave before assembling.  I also often take these as camping food--freeze the chicken in the marinade and let it marinate as it thaws (usually takes 2-3 hours)--cooks the same from that point (and no messy dishes to wash!).,

If it holds the line the jam is ready. Remove the jam from the oven and let cool. I eat this jam fresh so I put it into jars and keep it in the fridge.,

instructions, 1. Brown ground beef in a non-stick pan seasoning with salt and pepper.  When its just cooked through drain on paper towels to dispose of excess grease.  Return beef to pan along with enough drained oil so it's moist add the cardamom cayenne crushed/chopped garlic and the finely chopped onion.  Cook until the onion & garlic  is softened and spice is fragrant.  Remove from heat and cool.
2. To form the sambosas take about a tablespoon (if using the small wontons more if using the egg roll size) not too much ensuing that you can fold the wonton over into a triangle without the filling falling out.   Brush one side of the wonton with water at the edge to make a tight seal using either your fingers or tines of a fork to do this.  Make all the sambosas and keep on a sheet covered with paper towels to prevent sticking.  You can do all this ahead of time and store covered with Plastic Wrap in the fridge till ready to cook.
3. When ready to finish the sambosas put a nonstick pan or pot onto med/high heat and add enough oil for shallow frying about half to 3/4 an inch of oil should do it.  Shallow fry in batches till golden brown and drain on a wire rack or paper towels.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and serve best when hot but are good at room temp too. I serve them with my family's chilled yogurt sauce(see other recipe). Not healthy but delicious even my southern wife and family loves them!

Instead of measuring water into the pot rest your index finger on the surface of the rice and fill the pot with water until it hits the middle of your finger (this should be the area where the major wrinkles in your finger meet at your finger's joint). This is a traditional Persian trick ;] The water used is a little more than two cups.
5. Add salt to taste (about one teaspoon).
6. Mix the rice and water well.
7. Cook uncovered until the water is absorbed by the rice.
8. Once the water is mostly absorbed add canola oil.
9. Stir gently.

instructions, 1. You should need from 3–5 lemons for 3/4 cup of juice.
2. Break up the head of garlic with your hands letting the unpeeled cloves fall into a blender. Add the lemon juice and ½ teaspoon of the salt. Blend on high for a few seconds until you have a coarse puree. Let the mixture stand for 10 minutes to let the garlic mellow.
3. Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer set over a large mixing bowl pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids. Add the tehina to the strained lemon juice in the bowl along with the cumin and 1 teaspoon of the salt.
4. Whisk the mixture together until smooth (or use a food processor) adding ice water a few tablespoons at a time to thin it out. The sauce will lighten in color as you whisk. When the tehina seizes up or tightens keep adding ice water bit by bit (about 1 ½ cups in total) whisking energetically until you have a perfectly smooth creamy thick sauce.
5. Taste and add up to 1 ½ teaspoons more salt and cumin if you like. If you're not using the sauce immediately whisk in a few extra tablespoons of ice water to loosen it before refrigerating. The tehina sauce will keep a week refrigerated or it can be frozen for up to a month.,

instructions, 1. Thaw phyllo dough inside sealed pkg on counter at least an hour (it can still be cold).
2. Start preheating your oven to 300.
3. Roll the walnuts a couple handfuls at a time inside a large freezer ziplock bag with a rolling pin. I can only get them as fine as about the size of pearl barley before I say "good enough" and it seems to work fine but one person say it should be finer (but they eat it up immediately so nobody's tastebuds are complaining).
4. Place a 13x9 pan with 1 tbsp butter/margarine in the oven for a couple minutes to melt the butter remove it back out. If there is any excess pour it into your saucepan.
5. Melt your butter in a saucepan on low heat putting any whole spices (such as whole cardamom or whole cloves) in to release their flavor.
6. Lay 6 layers or so of phyllo dough in pan. Sprinkle with 1/2 c rolled walnuts (should almost cover) 1-2 tbsp of cinnamon (should cover) and drizzle 1-2 tsbp melted butter and 1 tbsp of honey.
7. Layer 4 layers of phyllo (I found I could use broken sheets in the middle layers as long as I used whole sheets for top and bottom and it was unnoticeable) and repeat. Aim for 4 layers of walnut. You will not use up the whole pkg of phyllo. Wrap tighly and refreeze.
8. Top with the last layers of phyllo cut with a sharp knife lengthwise to make 4 rows (don't cut all the way to the bottom) and then diagonally crossways every 1.5 inches or so (start by cutting a triagle shape at the top of each row diagonals all the way down and end with a triangle again).
9. Drizzle with 2 tbsp melted butter bake 1 hr or until top is golden brown. Remove and let cool to room temp (few hours) then liberally drizzle honey into every crackand around the edges. The cracks should be full to the top. And drizzle a little across the surface.
10. Let sit until honey is absorbed (another hour or as long as you want) then cut with sharp knife ALL the way through to the bottom layer in stacks on a plate and serve.
11. Cover like on a cakeplate or under a large bowl.,

2. In a medium saucepan bring the water and salt to a boil.
3. Add the rinsed rice and boil uncovered on high heat for 2 minutes.
4. Cover the pan reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. The water should have absorbed after twenty minutes. Turn the heat off keep the pan on the burner and let stand for 10 minutes. Note: I left the rice to stand a total of 20 minutes while I prepared the rest of the meal.
5. Melt the butter (or butter/olive oil) in a frying pan. Sautè the pine nuts and *ground cinnamon (or cinnamon stick) until the pine nuts are light golden. Watch  this step carefully because pine nuts burn easily (and they cost a pretty penny here so I am extra careful!). *If you choose ground cinnamon only sautè 3/4 teaspoon of it and save the remaining 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon for sprinkling on top of the rice just before serving.
6. Transfer the rice to a serving dish or platter drizzle the toasted pine nuts/butter mixture over the rice and garnish with the cinnamon stick or a dusting of ground cinnamon. Sprinkle with freshly grated black pepper.

instructions, 1. Dissolve the yeast and the sugar in about a half cup of the lukewarm water. Let stand until frothy.
2. Sift the flour together with the salt and add the yeast mixture. Knead by hand until the dough is soft adding water as necessary. Add the oil and keep kneading until the dough becomes elastic and is no longer sticky which should take about 15 minutes.
3. Now form the dough into a ball and rub all over with a little bit of olive oil to prevent it from drying out. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and roll flat until each ball is about a quarter inch thick. Dust with flour and transfer to a lightly floured surface leaving a few inches between each one to allow for rising. Let rise for another 30 to 60 minutes.
5. Oil two large baking sheets. Preheat your oven to 500 degrees. About 10 minutes into the preheating put the sheets in the oven. Leave them there for another 10 minutes.
6. Now open your oven and quickly transfer the dough balls onto the baking sheets.
7. Bake for 6 to 10 minutes. When the breads are lightly browned take them out. Let cool.

instructions, 1. The best way to fry these are in tiny dollops dropped from a spoon (or I use metal kitchen tongs and pick up small clumps of batter) and use a deep wok. the cooking method is so important so follow the directions exactly for perfect results.
2. Place potatoes in a medium saucepan and just cover with cold water. Turn heat to high and allow to come to boil. As soon as potatoes are boiling put a kitchen timer on for 10 minutes. When timer rings remove potatoes from stove and cover with cold water. Drain immediately then cover again with cold water. Let sit five minutes. Remove potatoes and pat dry.
3. Using a hand shredder (best) or food processor fitted with a medium disc shred potatoes (with skins on). The potatoes should be slightly softened but still firm enough to produce shreds. If the peel separates from the potato discard it. If the peel gets grated in with the potatoes it's fine and just incorporate it into the mixture. I like the hand grater best. When I use the processor I use two thirds shredded then pulverized potatoes and one third shredded for a mixture than is bulky but still has shreds. Worth the trouble.
4. In a large bowl blend shredded potatoes grated onion eggs flour baking powder salt and pepper. Place newspaper on work surface (near frying area) and cover with a few paper towels. In a large deep skillet (I like to use a wok) pour in enough vegetable oil to fill about two thirds. If using an electric fry pan set the temperature to 350°F or 375°F (depending on how fast you want the pancakes to cook). Drop potato batter by teaspoons (for small ones) or soup spoonfuls in small dollops flattening slightly with a metal spatula if desired. I use large metal tongs for dropping and turning. Brown one side turn once and complete cooking on other side. These cook quickly. You're looking for a puffy centre while retaining some crisp shreds of potato on edges.
5. Serve immediately or freeze. To reheat place latkes on a large wire cake rack on a cookie sheet. Warm at 250°F until crisp. For freezing purposes fry them a little underdone to allow for browning in the re-heating stage.,

6. I marinated the meat overnight.  Weigh the leg of lamb to determine the amount of time it will need in the oven for rare medium or well-done.
7. I like to cook roasts at lower temperatures for a long time so I veered off from the given recipe and cooked it for 3 hours at 250 Fahrenheit.  If I had had more time I would probably have cooked it 4 hours at 200 degrees Fahrenheit. The meat was tender due to both the yogurt and the long cooking.  My leg of lamb was 1.3 kilos or 2.8 pounds.  Serve with flavored basmati rice.,

instructions, 1. SOAK dry garbanzo beans over night about 8-12 hrs (not counted in the prep time) *using canned garbanzo beans is ok just has that tin can tangy taste.
2. DRAIN water and place garbanzo beans in a pot w/ 4 cups of water & 1 tsp baking soda. BRING to boil then simmer until beans are either 3/4 to fully cooked depending on the texture you are looking for. (time depends on the dry beans).
3. Remove beans from pot and reserve the garbanzo beans broth. You can set aside 1/2c of the beans if you want a chunkier hummus to stir in at the end.
4. PLACE garbanzo beans in food processor and about 1/2-1 c reserved broth. PULSE until the beans are chopped up.
5. Now ADD the garlic salt & tahini to the processor & BLEND on high until combined and a bit smoother. Scrape sides if needed.
6. ADD the lemon juice and the olive oil  & PROCESS on high until smooth. (taste and add more lemon juice garlic tahini or olive oil to attain your desired taste)
7. Scrape the sides and add more reserved garbanzo beans broth to thin it if you desire. The broth is the lighter choice however for a really yummy hummus of course you would add more olive oil and a bit more tahini :-).
8. If you saved the 1/2c garbanzo beans then go ahead and stir them in or if in a hurry pulse the blade a couple of times.
9. Place hummus in small shallow bowls and drizzle w/ olive oil (about 2 tsp). Remember this additional olive oil isn't in the calorie info.,

5. Enjoy!
6. If you don't have bulgur (or bourghul) you can used some cous cous which has soaked in chicken stock.  It has the same over all effect but doesn't have the crunch.,

5. Let them marinate for at least 5 days before eating They will keep for about a month The oil is wonderful for cooking with when your done.,

instructions, 1. Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Add some salt and cook until a fork easily goes through them.
2. Grate onion in a large bowl.
3. Once your potatoes are done peel them and then grate them in the same bowl with the onion. Mix to combine. (This is traditionally done by hand!).
4. Add turmeric advieh salt and pepper in the bowl. Mix to incorporate spices into potato-onion mixture.
5. Crack eggs into the mixture and combine. (If you're still going the traditional route you continue with your hands.).
6. Finally add the ground beef to the mixture and mix. (Again keep mixing at it with the hands!).
7. If you find that the mixture is too wet add breadcrumbs until it becomes more friendly.
8. Take a small amount out of the mixture (about 2 tablespoons) and make a large meatball with it. Then pat it flat into a patty that is not too thick or too thin. Traditionally they are shaped into teardrops; however mine just come out as sloppy ovals.
9. Continue with the rest of the mixture and as you finish each patty place it on parchment paper.
10. Wash your hands and heat vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Fry a few kotlets at a time making sure not to overcrowd.
11. Once you see that the bottom has turned a golden brown where the edges are a rich brown and crispy flip them over. Add more oil as necessary.
12. Place a dish with a paper towel in it next to your work station. When removing the kotlets from the pan try to drain as much of the oil as possible then place onto the plate.
13. Serve immediately.

instructions, 1. Skin and rinse the potatoes and place them in a pot and bring to a boil until soft throughout when pricked with a fork. Take out and grate them in a large bowl. (This can also be made with uncooked potatoes but will take slightly longer to cook).
2. Skin the onion leaving the end for easier grating. Grate the onion in the same bowl as the potatoes.
3. Add the ground turkey to the mix of grated potatoes and onion and mash them together by hand.
4. Add all the dry ingredients and mash everything together by hand. Traditionally an easy trick to knowing whether or not your mix has enough salt is picking up a piece of the mix and doing a quick dab on the tongue (not eating the meat of course). May sound gross but this will give you a definite idea of the amount of salt in your mix.
5. If you feel the mix is too dry add the egg. Otherwise you are ready to fry.
6. Add the oil to the pan and turn on medium heat. I like to use grape see oil as a healthier choice.
7. Once the oil is heated pick up a small amount of the mixture and form a ball with your hands then pat down the ball into an oval shape on your palm. The oval should cover almost all of your palm. The shape is hard to make perfectly at first but will get easier with practice.
8. Place the oval gently into the oil. Cook for about 7 minutes on each side or until golden brown on each side. Be careful not to overcook and burn the cutlets as this is easy to to.
9. Serve over rice or with bread and fresh greens. Wonderful cold as well!,

instructions, 1. In a small bowl stir together the yeast 1 teaspoon sugar and one-fourth cup warm water. Set aside until the yeast begins to foam 5 to 10 minutes.
2. In a medium bowl whisk together the 2 eggs oil rosewater or orange flower water vanilla remaining three-fourths cup warm water and salt.
3. In the bowl of a stand electric mixer fitted with a dough hook place 41/2 cups (19.1 ounces) flour sugar fennel seeds 3 tablespoons sesame seeds raisins and grated peel.  Mix briefly to combine. Make a well in the middle and add the yeast and egg mixtures. Mix on medium-low speed adding the remaining flour as necessary and mixing until the dough leaves the sides of the bowl. Stop occasionally to scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. The dough should still be slightly sticky. (The dough can also be mixed by hand; combine the ingredients and mix as listed above until the dough comes together then knead; the dough will require additional kneading time.).
4. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead 5 minutes; the dough will be ready when it springs back quickly when poked. Place the dough in an oiled bowl cover and set aside in a warm place until doubled in size about 11/2 hours.
5. While the dough is rising heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with a silpat or parchment paper. Punch down the dough and set aside for 5 minutes to rest. Divide the dough into 12 to 14 pieces and roll each piece between the palms of the hand into smooth ovals about 3 inches long. Place the ovals onto the lined sheet leaving 11/2 to 2 inches between each (if your baking sheet is small you may need to use 2).
6. In a small bowl whisk together the remaining egg yolk with the honey and brush this over each of the ovals. Sprinkle over the remaining sesame seeds and nigella (or black sesame seeds). Cover the ovals loosely with a piece of plastic wrap and set aside for 15 to 20 minutes to rise then bake until golden-brown about 25 minutes.,

instructions, 1. Place chickpeas in a large bowl cover generously with water and soak overnight (at least 12 hours and up to 24).
2. Drain chickpeas.  Add onion garlic bread parsley and red sweet pepper.  Run through the fine blade of a meat grinder.  (You may process in food processor until mealy.) Add spices flour 10 mL (2 tsp) baking powder and water.  Mix well.
3. In a small dish mix the remaining baking powder and water.  Use it to moisten the palm of your hands and form balls of the chickpea mixture the size of walnuts then flatten a bit (basically a slightly flattened meatball shape).
4. Deep fry in oil at medium high heat until golden brown.
5. Serve piping hot (these can be made ahead and frozen- rewarm in the oven).
6. Serving Suggestion:  Using a 6-inch Arabic pita bread lay 4-5 falafel (this depends on how big you've made them) down the length of the pita.  Turn the pita over the falafel and using the heels of your hands smoosh down on the falafels (not so hard that you totally melt them but hard enough to flatten them somewhat).  Open the pita again and add fixings of your choice.  We like slices of tomato dill pickle and a hearty sprinkle of parsley and LOTS and LOTS of fresh spearmint.  Dress with sauce.  Roll up as in a sandwich wrap and enjoy an extremely flavourful sandwich!
7. For Taratoor Sauce: In a deep bowl beat the tahini with the crushed garlic and lemon juice until creamy.  Add water bit by bit beating well after each addition If using blender put all the ingredients in and blend.  Add salt and parsley and stir.  Taste and add more lemon juice if needed - the sauce should be tangy.
8. Refrigerate until ready to use.  This is also a great dip for crudites.,

instructions, 1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. (Make sure the pot is a heavy bottom pot.).
2. Add 3-4 tablespoons of salt to the water.
3. Scoop out the desired amount of rice into a bowl (whatever amount you want just remember 1 cup dry makes 3 cups cooked).
4. Pour water over it to rinse it and then pour the water off.
5. Repeat this until the water runs clear.
6. Add the rice to the boiling water.
7. Boil rapidly for 5 minutes.
8. Bring pot to the sink and turn the cold water on to make the starchy water overflow.
9. Drain into a colander.
10. Put the pot back onto the stove at medium to medium high heat (this may vary depending on your stove) and add oil (enough to just cover the bottom).
11. In a small bowl melt butter (about 1 tablespoon of butter per cup of dry rice) with a pinch saffron in it (if you have a mortar and pestel grind the saffron first otherwise don't worry about it).
12. Sprinkle the rice with a spoon into a mound in the pan on the stove.
13. Poke 3-4 holes into the top and pour the butter down the holes.
14. Take a scoop of the rice from the mound and stir in the bowl used to melt the butter (just to get the last of the saffron butter out).
15. Put the rice back into the pot.
16. Place about 3 layers of paper towels to cover the top of the pan and then place the lid tightly over the pan.
17. Cook at the medium-medium high heat for 8 minutes.
18. Turn the stove down to the lowest temperature it will go and steam for 35 more minutes.
19. To serve scoop the rice out from the top of the pan being careful not to brake the crust on the bottom.
20. Once all the rice is out except for the crust (tadig) take another plate big enough to cover the opening of the pan and flip the crust out onto the pan. It should be golden brown and beautiful! If it is black the temperature of your stove was too high and the entire pot of rice may taste burnt.
21. Once you get the hang of this you can try using sliced rounds of potato or pita bread on the bottom of the pan before you sprinkle in the boiled rice (both of these options are very yummy!).,

instructions, 1. Crush the saffron and mix it in 1 teaspoon of boiling water set aside.
2. In a large bowl whisk together the 1/2 cup warm water the yeast and sugar. Let stand about 5 minutes or until frothy.
3. Stir in the 1 cup water and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil saffron mix. Add 2 cups of the bread flour the 1-2/3 cups semolina flour the turmeric caraway seed and salt. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until combined scraping sides of bowl occasionally.
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining bread flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes total). Shape dough into a ball. Grease a large bowl with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Place dough in greased bowl; turn once to grease surface of dough. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double in size (about 1 hour).
5. Punch dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper; sprinkle parchment with the 1 tablespoon semolina flour. Set aside. Shape each dough half into a 6-inch round loaf. Place dough rounds on the prepared baking sheet. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly double in size (about 30 minutes).
6. Adjust one oven rack to the lowest position and another oven rack to the lower-middle position. Set a shallow baking pan on the bottom rack. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
7. Using a sharp knife cut an X into the top of each loaf. Place baking sheet with dough rounds on the middle rack. Place the ice cubes in the shallow baking pan on the lower (as they melt they'll create steam which helps the dough rise and develop a crisp crust). Bake rounds about 25 minutes or until deep golden and rounds sound hollow when tapped. If necessary to prevent overbrowning cover rounds with foil for the last 10 minutes of baking.
8. Transfer to a wire rack; cool completely.,

4. These can also be pan fried or grilled but it's not the same. So I very much recommend cooking them as directed in the recipe as the pan drippings are pretty much key in this. Broiling/cook time will depend on the thickness of your patties and how well you like them done. I'm gonna say 18 minutes just for a roundup/ballpark est.,

instructions, 1. Sprinkle soya sauce over tvp (mince or chunks) in a jug adding a splash of wine if you fancy. Pour about 2 cups boiling water over the tvp and soak until soft.( the original recipe use around 200ml of boiling water or just enough to cover the soya chunks).
2. Chop onion and carrots and fry gently in olive oil with all the spices and garlic for about 5 minutes covered without browning.
3. Add the rest of the ingredients including the soaking water/soya sauce from the tvp adding enough water to cover.
4. Cook for at least 30 minutes stirring occasionally to stop the veggies sticking. When the potatoes are starting to break up and thicken the stew it is ready. Stir to help the potatoes break up then add the second lot of larger quartered potatoes and continue to cook. It can take up to an hour. The end result should be a thick stew with the chopped potatoes all broken up to make a thick sauce with the larger quartered potatoes still reasonably intact.
5. Serve with steamed green spinach broccoli or cabbage.

instructions, 1. Combine the flour yeast and salt in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the water and oil and give the mixture a few turns with a rubber spatula until a rough dough forms. Knead on medium speed until the dough comes together but is still a little ragged about 7 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl or dough-rising container cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. It will double in volume.
2. One hour before you want to bake remove the dough from the refrigerator. Turn it onto a lightly floured counter top and use a bench scraper or sharp chef’s knife to divide it into 2 equal pieces for large flat breads or 6 equal pieces for small ones. Shape the dough pieces into loose rounds sprinkle with flour and drape with plastic wrap. Let stand until puffy and almost doubled in volume about 1 hour.
3. While the dough rounds are proofing place a baking stone on the middle rack of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
4. Line a baker’s peel with parchment paper. Use your hands to stretch the larger dough pieces into 8-inch circles or press the smaller ones into 3-inch circles. Place the dough circles on the parchment-lined peel. Press your fingertips into the dough rounds to create little dimples. Brush the rounds liberally with olive oil and sprinkle with za’atar.
5. Slide the dough still on the parchment onto the hot baking stone and bake until lightly browned about 10 minutes for large breads 7 minutes for small ones (don’t overbake or they’ll be too hard). Slide the breads still on the parchment onto a wire rack to cool slightly. Serve warm or cool completely and serve at room temperature. Mana’eesh are best eaten on the day they are baked.
6. For longer storage freeze in a zipper-lock plastic bag for up to 1 month. To defrost place on the counter top for 15 to 30 minutes and reheat in the oven at 350°F for 5 minutes before serving.,

2. (alternative quicker directions below).
3. Wash the barberries in cold water to rinse.
4. Heat 1 T of butter in a small frying pan and stir fry the raisins for 1-2 minutes.
5. Add the barberries stir fry for a few seconds and then add the sugar and half of the cinnamon and cumin.
6. Cook briefly and set aside.
7. Drain the rice and then boil it in a pan of salted water for 5 minutes reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes till almost cooked.
8. Drain and rinse the rice in lukewarm water and wash and dry the pan.
9. Heat half of the remaining butter in the pan add 1 T water and stir in half of the rice.
10. Blend the reserved rice with the remaining cinnamon and cumin and sprinkle over the top of the rice mixture.
11. Dribble the remaining butter over and cover the pan with a clean dishtowel and secure with a tightly fitting lid lifting the corners of the cloth back over the lid.
12. Steam the rice over a very low heat for about 30-40 minutes.
13. Just before serving mix 3 T of the rice with the saffron water.
14. QUICKER ALTERNATIVE:
15. Follow the first steps through simmering the rice for 10 minutes.  This worked nicely for me with just adding in the barberries and currants sugar and spices that have been sauteed in the butter along with the remaining butter and spices stirring it into the almost-cooked rice at this point putting the lid on and steaming on very low heat for about 20 minutes.  The longer you let it steam the more it develops a nice slight crustiness.
16. Spoon the rice on to a large flat serving dish and sprinkle the saffron rice over the top to garnish.,

instructions, 1. Prepare a square 8x8" or 9x9" baking pan by lining the bottom and sides with parchment paper. Spray with canola oil.
2. Mix the Tahini thoroughly before measuring. It separates easily and the thicker part at the bottom needs to be mixed in before pouring to measure.
3. Bring 1 c of water to a boil.
4. At the same time start the Tahini on low in a sauce pan. Stir in the vanilla. Continue to  heat while occasionally stirring until it reaches about 50°C (120°F). Do not heat it up too quickly or go over temp because it will scorch. Remove from heat when it reaches temperature.
5. Once the water is boiling pour it over the sugar in a larger pan and stir until dissolved.
6. Over high heat bring the sugar water to a boil until it reaches 121°C (not over 250°F). Use a candy thermometer.
7. As you're waiting for the sugar water to get to temp the tahini should reach the proper temperature.
8. Pour it into the bowl of a stand mixer with the mixing paddle attached.
9. When the sugar water reaches the proper temp immediately turn the heat off and start the stand mixer on low while pouring in the sugar water until combined. Be careful it is scorching hot!
10. Bump the speed up to 3 and watch carefully as it mixes. It won't take longer than about 30 seconds to get to the proper consistency. When you see the mixture starting to pull away from the side of the bowl stop mixing immediately and pour the mixture into your prepared pan.
11. It will begin to stiffen as you are pouring it into the pan so be quick about scraping the remains out of the bowl. With a flat scraper or back of a wide wooden spoon press the mixture into a level layer.
12. Let cool for about a half an hour at room temp then remove solidified piece from pan and cut into 36 pieces (6 rows and 6 columns).
13. Wrap the Halva up in an airtight container or plastic wrap and keep in fridge. It will last for months as long as it's sealed but I'm sure it will be long gone by then. Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. In the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook sprinkle yeast over water (at about 100F). Let stand 5 minutes until foamy. (If it doesn't foam get fresh yeast and start over.).
2. In a bowl mix the two flours and whisk until well combined. Add the salt and half the flour mixture to mixer bowl. Run machine at 3 or 4 until flour is incorporated. Continue to add flour a little at a time until it forms a rough shaggy dough. Increase speed to 6 and knead 8 minutes until smooth and elastic. Check every few minutes; if it seems sticky add a little more flour.
3. Turn out onto a floured surface and perform 3-5 hand-kneading turns then divide into 8 balls (to make medium-sized pitas).
4. Roll each ball out into a 1/4" thick disk. They will puff up better if they are an even thickness from edge to edge. Cover with a tea towel and allow to rise 30-45 minutes until slightly puffed. Meanwhile preheat oven to 425°F.
5. Using a large spatula flip dough rounds onto a baking sheet - the surface that was facing up in the air should be down on the metal. Bake 10-15 minutes until light golden-brown. (They should puff within the first 5 minutes rising to about 4" in thickness.).,

instructions, 1. Combine dried beans and grains in a large bowl add water to cover and let soak for 8 hours.
2. Wash greens and herbs well. The best way to do this is to soak in cool water and swish leaves around. Let sit for a couple minutes and lift out into a colander and rinse with water. Repeat a couple more times to remove any dirt. Allow to dry well. Chop all in batches in food processor and set aside.
3. After 8 hours pour off water from beans and grains. Transfer beans and grains to a large pot and add water to cover by two inches. Place over high heat and bring to a boil. Once it comes to a boil skim off all the foam possible. Once the beans begin to soften add garlic and ginger. Season with a couple teaspoons of salt. Once the beans are halfway cooked add green and herbs. Season with pepper. Prepare onions.
4. Cut onions in half once lengthwise and once crosswise to form quarters. Thinly slice into short slivers. Heat oil in a large skillet and fry onions until golden. Strain onions to remove excess oil. Set aside a couple tablespoons for serving. Add remaining onion to pot with beans and greens. If liquid in the pot is running low add boiling water to keep the mixture loose. Ideally the water will be two inches higher than the beans in the pot. Simmer beans and greens mixture for 20 minutes. Add noddles to pot and simmer 30 minutes until all ingredients are cooked through. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add boiling water if mixture is too thick. The soup should be rather thick but it should remain pourable.
5. To serve top with whey or sour cream fresh or dried mint fried in olive oil minced garlic fried in olive oil (do not let it gain color or it will be bitter) and fried onions.,

instructions, 1. Mix all the ingredients except for the water together.
2. If you have to proof the yeast first (I don't) then proof it in a little warm water with some of the sugar.
3. If using an electric mixer with a dough hook start kneading the dough while slowly adding warm water a little at a time until you get a pliable but slightly sticky dough.
4. You don't want the dough to be stiff enough to pick up and throw at someone (don't laugh it's been done before) but at the same time you don't want the dough to be so gloopy you have to dish it out with a spoon.
5. You want this to have a little substance but still still to the bowl a bit and to your hands.
6. If you are working by hand just read the above directions but forget about the dough hook.
7. First use a good heavy wooden spoon then start working and kneading with your hands.
8. Let the dough rise until doubled.
9. If you don't have enough patience for this a good zap in the microwave for 30 seconds on high every 15 minutes or so should give that dough a good burst of energy.
10. When the dough has doubled in bulk punch it down (feels good doesn't it) wipe the sticky dough off your hands and let it rise until doubled again.
11. Punch it down again.
12. Pour about two inches of oil in a pot that's suitable for deep frying.
13. I used a smallish pot and fried the zalabia two at a time.

time, ,

instructions, 1. *Note: I roasted the brussels sprouts instead of steaming them. I used Barefoot Contessa's basic recipe for: Recipe #56103.
2. Or to STEAM the brussels sprouts: Bring a skillet half full of water to a boil. Trim the bottom of the Brussels sprouts. Cut in half if small or into lengthwise quarters if larger. You want the pieces to be of roughly equal size so they’ll cook in the same amount of time.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of salt to the boiling water. Add sprouts and give them a stir. Cook for about 3 to 5 minutes or until bright green and beginning to be tender. They’ll keep cooking a bit after they’re drained.
4. DRESSING: While the brussels sprouts are cooking prepare the dressing. Squeeze juice of the zested Meyer lemon into a measuring cup. Add twice as much olive oil as lemon juice. Whisk well.
5. Once the brussels sprouts are removed from the pan or oven drain well (if they were steamed) and immediately toss with lemon zest. Grate the zest with a microplane directly onto the sprouts.
6. Transfer the Brussels sprouts to a serving platter.
7. Gently drizzle the pomegranate molasses on the brussels sprouts and garnish with the nuts. Check for salt and pepper.
8. Drizzle the dressing over the Brussels sprouts.

instructions, 1. Trim the ends from the eggplant and peel it--here's the tricky part--in five long peels using a large knife--the easiest way is to stand the eggplant on end mark the other end in fifths and saw off the skin allowing some pulp to be attached.
2. Cube the remaining eggplant and grill or roast it lightly (this instead of saute-ing which uses much more oil).
3. In a large skillet heat the oil and then saute the eggplant peels skin side UP by covering the pan and cooking over moderate heat about five minutes or until the pulp is lightly browned.
4. Remove the slices and allow them to cool slightly.
5. Arrange them in a one and a half quart round baking dish star fashion with the narrow end in the center of the bowl and the wide end hanging over the top edge; the five pieces of peel should be equidistant from each other and should overlap in the bottom.
6. Set aside.
7. In the warm skillet saute the onion and garlic until lightly browned then add the grilled or roasted eggplant and combine with the 3 tablespoons of tomato paste and the allspice and cinnamon.  Season to taste with salt and pepper mix well remove from heat and set aside.
8. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
9. Mix the ground lamb with the paprika and tomato paste and if you like  some salt and pepper.
10. Wet your hands and little by little press the lamb onto the bowl on top of the peels and without disturbing the pattern formed by the peels; the inside of the bowl should be completely covered with the lamb mixture though it need not come all the way to the rim of the bowl.
11. Spoon the reserved eggplant/onion mixture into the meat -lined bowl and fold the ends of the eggplant peel over the top.
12. Cover the bowl closely with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes.
13. Remove from the oven and let the bowl rest for 15 minutes before removing the foil.
14. Invert carefully onto a platter and serve surrounded by rice or orzo and accompanied by a tomato sauce.,

instructions, 1. Marinate in refrigerator overnight mix a few times.
2. If cooking on coals make sure the coals are smoldering and there are no flair-ups.  They should look white/grayish.  Meat should be about five inches from coals to start with; you can shorten the distance if more portions need to be cooked once first portion is finished.  Also keep a spray bottle filled with salted water handy to put out flair-ups from dripping fat.  Cook uncovered.
3. Gas grill should be set so no flame reaches the meat or it will burn.  This could mean low to medium heat depending on the grill.  You'll be placing skewers right on the grates or if you have a kabob rack - use it.  Cook uncovered.
4. Before grilling REMOVE ALL ONIONS FROM MEAT.
5. Skewer meat cubes spaced about 1/4 inch apart.  Keep in mind longer and thicker/wider stainless steel skewers will make your job a lot easier.  Don't skewer cubes outside of direct heat area.
6. Your total cooking time will be anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes.  Overcooking meat is not a good idea.  Turn meat every minute or so keep flair-ups under control (spray coals in exact spot of flair-up with your bottle to put out the flames).  Occasional charring on edges is okay.
7. First sign that your meat is getting close to being ready is the incredible aroma you'll notice.  The meat should be uniformly browned pull one piece off a skewer and test for readiness.  Should you find it to your liking - remove from grill.
8. Slide meat from skewers with a fork or (traditionally) bread crust.
9. Put cooked meat in a covered dish/pot to keep it warm.  Keep the meat warm.  At all costs :).
10. GARNISH: Toss together a few thinly chopped sprigs of cilantro one large red onion sliced in thin rings one table spoon lemon juice.  Mix this garnish with the cooked kabob in a covered dish (shake it with lid on to evenly distribute garnish).  Sprinkle a few pinches of salt and sumac (if you have sumac) right before serving.  KEEP THE MEAT WARM IN A COVERED DISH!,

10. Following is a simple clarification method.  It’s not perfect but easy and close enough.  Slowly melt a stick of butter. Remove from heat and allow butter to cool undisturbed for 10 minutes to separate.  You will notice a white foam on the top the clarified butter in the center and milk solids at the bottom.  Carefully skim the foam off the top and discard.  Slowly pour the clarified butter off the milk solids into a measuring cup. Discard the separated solids.

instructions, 1. FOR THE MEAT:  Prepare the meaty stew or soup.  In a large pan put the meat and about 1/2 pound  onions coarsely chopped and cover with about 1 1/2 quarts water.  Bring to the boil and remove the scum.  Add salt pepper the ginger 1 teaspoon cinnamon and the cloves and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.  Add the saffron and more water to keep the meat well covered (there should be a lot of broth) and simmer for 1/2 hour more.  The meat should be so tender you could pull it apart with your hands.
2. FOR THE TFAYA:  For the honeyed onion tfaya cut the onions in half and slice them.  Put them in a pan with about 1 cup water.  Put the lid on and cook covered over low heat (they will steam) for about 1/2 hour until the onions are very soft.  Remove the lid and cook until the liquid has evaporated.  Add the butter and oil and cook until the onions are golden.  Stir in the honey and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon the drained raisins and a pinch of salt and cook 10 minutes more or until the onions caramelize and become brown.
3. Toast the almonds in a dry frying pan or fry them in a drop of oil until golden turning them over.  Coarsely chop about half of them.
4. FOR THE COUSCOUS:  Put the couscous in a wide oven proof dish so that the grains are not squashed on top of each other. (I use a large round clay dish in which I also serve). Gradually add the warm salted water stirring all the time so that it is absorbed evenly.  Keep fluffing up the grain with a fork and breaking up any lumps (as the grains stick together).  After about 10-15 minutes when the grain is plump and tender mix in 3 tablespoons vegetable oil and rub the grain between your hands above the bowl to air it and break up any lumps.
5. Put the dish uncovered in a preheated 400°F oven and heat through for 15 to 20 minutes until very hot.  After about 10 minutes fluff it up again with a fork.  Before serving work in 3 tablespoons butter or vegetable oil and break up any lumps very thoroughly.
6. TO SERVE:   Make a mound of couscous and make a hollow in the center.  Moisten with a ladle of the meat broth.  Put the meat in the hollow and cover with the onion and raisin tfaya.
7. Sprinkle with a mixture of chopped and whole toasted or fried blanched almonds and serve the broth separately.  Alternatively you might prefer to serve everything separately or straight into soup plates.  Serves 6.

time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. When you are ready to prepare your meal: Boil the egg noodles and drain (see Step #11). Melt some butter (and/or olive oil) in a saute pan. Add the noodles salt and pepper and cook for a 3-4 minutes on medium heat.
2. Add the arugula and stir; cooking just until slightly wilted; about 30-45 seconds. Remember that the arugula will continue to cook off heat.
3. Arrange the noodles on a serving platter (I added a light drizzle of olive oil) sprinkle of salt and cracked black pepper. Sprinkle all over with  the walnuts.
4. Add a dollop of thick plain yogurt to each serving; garnish with fresh parsley.
5. How to make Turkish Noodles (Eriste) by hand: In a large bowl sift flour with salt. Make a hole in the middle. Crack the eggs inside. Slowly mix the flour into the eggs with your fingers.
6. Place the dough on a lightly floured counter knead well until smooth (no more crumbles). While you are kneading wet your hands 2-3 times so the dough is smooth.
7. Give the dough a round shape and cover it with a clean towel. Set aside for about 30 minutes.
8. Place some flour on the counter and the rolling pin. Cut the dough into 3 pieces (original recipe 2 pieces). Roll each piece out into a rectangle shape until you have very thin sheets.
9. Leave the sheets for 1 hour on the floured counter or tray.
10. For each sheet first roll it then cut the rolls into strips about 1 cm wide . Open up the rolls immediately (to avoid the dough sticking together) and place on parchment paper. Then cut the strips 2.5 cm in length. (For imperial measurements I roughly gauged cutting the rolls into a width of 1" then again into 3" lengths-give or take a half inch.).
11. Boil water with salt in a large pot. Throw the noodles in cover pot and immediately bring back to boil. Once water is boiling remove lid and cook pasta for about 4-5 minutes. Taste to see if the noodles are cooked. Drain.
12. For KitchenAid stand up mixer method: Add all ingredients to the bowl and using a dough hook knead for approximately 5 minutes or until dough is smooth. You will need to stop the machine and coax the flour/egg mixture downward into the bowl. Proceed with recipe in Step #7.
13. This next step I *did not* test: If you don't want to cook the pasta immediately spread the noodles on parchment paper until they have all dried. Store the dried pasta in a Ziploc-type bag an airtight jar etc.
14. Cooking time does not include preparing the egg noodles.,

instructions, 1. Couscous  --  How easy  -  just heat up the liquid (I use chicken broth vegetable would work too or just water) in a bowl in the microwave to a boil.  Follow package direction for the amount of liquid needed.  Once the water comes to a boil remove add the couscous stir cover with plastic wrap and 5 minutes later - it is done. Just set off to the side as the scallops and sauce don't take long to cook. Before serving I fluff the couscous with a fork and add in the thin sliced scallions cilantro salt and pepper.
2. Scallops  --  As the couscous rests start the sauce and scallops.  In a large sauce pan heat to medium high and add 2 teaspoons of butter and 1 teaspoon olive oil.  Season the scallops with salt and pepper on each side.  And don't forget  --  room temperature you don't want them cold and right out of the refrigerator.  Sear the scallops on 1 side until golden brown (it will only take a couple of minutes) and don't move them around - just let them cook. Turn them over and cook another minute until brown but DON'T over cook they will continue to cook when you reheat them in the sauce. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm as you make the sauce.
3. Sauce  --  In the same pan you cooked the scallops add 1 teaspoon more butter and cook the garlic and onions for 3-4 minutes until tender on medium. Stir in the curry powder and cook another minute until everything is combined and the flavor is absorbed by the onions.
4. Puree  --  Transfer the curried onions to a blender and add the broth tomato paste and half and half and pulse a few times until good and creamy.  Then return the sauce to the pan and back on medium heat. Not too high because you don't want the cream to curdle. Add in the spinach and toss well then the scallops and simply cook another minute to let the scallops reheat and the spinach wilts. Check for seasoning one last time.  It is done!
5. Serve  --  Add one (1) cup of couscous to each plate and top with the curried scallops and spinach.  Now I happen to like some roasted grape tomatoes with this but use your favorite vegetable.  ENJOY!
6. They are mild but flavorful! ENJOY.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 325 or a little lower if your oven runs hot.
2. Combine all the filling ingredients mix well.
3. Butter a 12-by-9-inch or 13-by-9-inch baking pan or 15-by-10-inch jelly roll pan.
4. Remove the phyllo from the package and lay it flat on your counter. Cover the phyllo with wax paper or plastic wrap and place a slightly damp cloth over top.
5. Remove one sheet of phyllo and place flat on clean dry counter top butter as evenly as possible repeat with 3 more sheets of phyllo so there are 4 sheets buttered on top of one another as evenly as possible.
6. Place a few large spoonfuls of the mixture along the bottom of the top sheet of phyllo and fold the phyllo on the same end over the mixture. Then butter the edge of the sheet and continue to roll the phyllo as tightly and evenly as possible. Once you get to the end of the sheet you need to butter the edge as well before closing it. It should now basically be a long thick cigar shape.
7. Cut off the uneven ends slightly angled like a slash (but don’t throw them away just throw it into your remaining mixture).
8. Cut the roll into 2 inch pieces (slightly angled like a slash). Butter the ends of each before placing on the buttered baking sheet.
9. Repeat this same procedure until you have finished using all of the phyllo and mixture.
10. Once you have finished rolling the phyllo and placing the rolls buttered on each end on your pan butter the top of each roll. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes (this really depends on your oven; keep in mind that the baklava has to bake slowly at a low heat until GOLDEN BROWN).
11. Prepare the syrup noting that either the syrup should be hot and the baklava cool or visa versa when pouring it over top. (I leave the baklava to cool overnight on the counter and make the hot syrup to pour over the cooled baklava in the morning.).
12. Mix sugar and water and bring to the boil.
13. Add lemon juice and boil for 7 more minutes.
14. Remove from heat and add orange blossom water stir.
15. Pour over cooled baklava.
16. Allow the baklava to sit for about 20 minutes. Then turn over the individual rolls to allow both sides to soak in the liquid.
17. Leave the whole day or over night before serving.
18. Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. If using vine leaves in brine first drain them then put them in a large bowl and pour boiling water over them.  Make sure the water penetrates well between the layers and let the leaves soak for 20 minutes.  Drain.  Soak in fresh cold water then drain again and repeat the process once more.  This will remove the excess salt.
2. IF using fresh leaves: Soften them by plunging into boiling water one at a time until limp. Soak and wash the rice in boiling water then rinse under cold tap water.  Drain it well.
3. In a large bowl mix the rice with the meat chopped tomato onion parsley celery salt and pepper.  The 2 tbsp of tomato paste will add a Greek flavor.
4. Place 1 leaf vein side up.  Place a heaping tablespoon of filling on the center near the stem edge.  Fold the stem up over the filling then fold both sides toward the middle and roll up like a small cigar.  Squeeze lightly in the palm of your hand.  This process will become easier after you have rolled a few. Fill the rest.  Continue until the filling is used up.
5. Line the bottom of a large saucepan with a layer of tomato slices or leftover leaves to prevent the stuffing from sticking to the pan and burning.  Pack the stuffed leaves in tight layers on the top. Push small pieces of garlic here and there between them.  Sprinkle with lemon juice (you can use more than 1 lemon if needed) and add about 1/2 cup water.  Some cooks mix a little saffron with the water to give a pale yellow color to the filling this is optional and does not seem to change the taste. The leaves should give a pale lemon color to the rice anyway.
6. Put a small plate over the rolled leaves to prevent them from coming undone and cover with a lid.  Cook over a gentle heat for 2 hours or until tender add water gradually  as it becomes absorbed.
7. You may reduce the cooking time to 20 minutes if you use a pressure cooker but the taste is best with long simmering.
8. Turn onto dish and serve hot.
9. Lebanese: Cooks will add 4 or more cloves crushed garlic in addition to the slivers and a tbsp dried crushed mint with a little water about 20 minutes before the recipe is done.  Others including the Persians Lebanese and Greeks like 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon added to the filling.,

instructions, 1. Mix the vinegar chili powder black pepper salt and garlic paste together in a large bowl. Add the whole chicken and turn to coat. Refrigerate overnight turning occasionally to make sure you get good coverage.
2. While the chicken is marinading put the spice ingredients together in a hot pan. Keep stirring because you aren't using any oil and the spices will burn pretty quickly if left unattended. When they become fragrant remove them from the heat and transfer them to a grinder. Crush them into a fine powder. If you have larger bits in your mix it's a good idea to sift the spices through a fine mesh strainer as the bits won't be very pleasant to bite into. Set the mixture aside.
3. When the chicken has finished marinading transfer it to a preheated oven and cook at 350 degrees for about 30 to 45 minutes. Meanwhile light some coals in your barbecue (propane won't really work for this recipe you need the smoking coals to achieve the right flavor). When they are hot transfer the whole chicken to your barbecue and close the lid.
4. When the chicken develops a dark crispy skin take it off the grill and check the temperature of each thigh. It should read about 175. If it doesn't transfer back to your oven and keep cooking until the right temperature is achieved.
5. Let the chicken rest for about 10 or 15 minutes before carving.
6. Sprinkle each serving with some lemon juice and a little bit of the prepared spice mixture.,

instructions, 1. Line a colander with cheesecloth and place over a large bowl. In another large mixing bowl combine half of the diced onions (1 1/4 c) egg flour salt and baking powder. Mix with a rubber spatula to combine.
2. Peel potatoes and cut into 1" cubes working quickly so the potatoes do not brown. Using the grater attachment on your food processor grate the potato with the remaining 1 1/4 c of diced onions. Pour the potato/onion mixture into the cheesecloth lined colander over a bowl wrap cloth around mixture and wring out as much liquid as possible. Discard the liquid but save the potato starch that is clinging to the bottom of the bowl and to the cheesecloth.
3. Add potato/onion mixture along with the potato starch to the egg/flour/onion in other bowl.Stir the batter until it is combined and sticky.
4. Preheat oven to 425*F. Place a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet and set it beside your stove top.
5. Heat 1/2 c vegetable oil in a heavy bottomed skillet over medium high heat. Oil should be hot but not smoking (about 375*F but I don't use a thermometer). For each Latke use approx 1/4 c of batter and flatten in your hand (or on a slotted spoon) into approx 2" disk squeezing out any additional liquid. Using a slotted spoon gently place Latkes into the hot oil. (Use one sacrificial Latke to make sure the oil temp is correct. If it's too low they will be greasy and soggy too high they will burn). Only cook about 4 Latkes at a time so you do not drop the oil temperature. Cook Latkes approx 4 minutes on each side. Place fried Latkes onto the wire rack.
6. Between batches using a slotted spoon remove any bits that may be forming in the bottom of the pan and discard. Add more oil if needed between batches but be sure to let it rise to the correct temperature before starting another batch.
7. When completely done frying all the Latkes place the baking sheet into the oven for approx 8 minutes to finish baking them until crisp and golden brown.
8. Garnish with Recipe #509843 and/or sour cream.

instructions, 1. I marinated a small joint of Lamb (about 650g) in a paste of the first 4 ingredients.
2. At the same time I soaked 100g dry kidney beans in cold water.
3. Leave both overnight. (The Lamb covered with clingfilm in the fridge ;-).
4. The lamb doesn't have to be marinated at all. I just felt like it last night. Also Lamb chops work really well or indeed any other cut. The idea is that it is stewed very slowly and the greens and beans combine to create an amazing flavour.
5. However if it isnt marinated with the garlic then garlic needs to be added to the other ingredients.
6. I started with the beans which I cooked in the soaking water for about 30 minutes. So not quite done yet. They will finish off in the stew.
7. Next brown the meat in a pan then place it into a casserole dish.
8. In the same pan sweat the onions gently and add the Kale until it wilts a little.
9. Add this to the Lamb and then also add the beans and whole potatos.
10. Deglaze the pan with some stock and add that and about as much stock to just barely cover the greens.
11. Then cover with the lid and cook in a low oven (150 degrees) for 3 hours. Oh and if adding the dried lime um well you know what to do. Put it in as well :-).
12. Traditionally it is served with Rice but because i have added some nice big new Potatos I don't feel that it needs any Rice as well.,

instructions, 1. In a small frying pan fry the pine nuts and almond slivers together until they turn brown on medium heat. They will burn very quickly so be extra vigilant. Drain them onto a paper towel when browned. This step should take about 5 minutes.
2. In a larger or the same frying pan as before brown the ground meat until thoroughly cooked. You may season it with salt and pepper or seasoning salt if desired. Once thoroughly cooked add the nut mixture and stir well. This step should take about 20 minutes. Use this time to start boiling a large pot of water.
3. Once the meat mixture has cooled enough stuff each zuchini as full as possible without breaking them especially if some were poked through during the coring process. Stuff all of the zuchinis. This step should take about 20 minutes.
4. In a large frying pan add some cooking oil on medium heat. When hot add the zuchinis and fry them until they start to brown turning so both sides are more brown than green. You will know when they are done. This should take about 15 minutes.
5. Directly after browning add zuchinis to the waiting pot of hot water about an 8 quart pot. If your pot is not big enough you can do them in batches. Boil them for 10 minutes then transfer to a plate. Some meat mix may come loose this is normal.
6. To make the yogurt sauce mix one container of yogurt one egg half cup of milk and one tablespoon of corn starch in a blender. Pour into an 8-qt non-stick pot. Repeat with second container of yogurt.
7. Cook yogurt sauce on medium heat stirring quickly and constantly until the sauce thickens. Add 1 crushed beef buillon cube. You will know the sauce is done when it begins to stick to the pan and coats your stirring spoon. DO NOT LET IT BOIL! Salt to taste. This step should take about 15 minutes.
8. Add the zuchinis to the yogurt sauce and let them cook on medium-low heat for about 20 minutes. Again no boiling.
9. Now for the rice. Add the butter or ghee to a 3-qt or larger pot. Heat just until the butter begins to melt and add the vermicelli noodles and stir until all noodles are coated. Turn up the heat until they begin to fry and turn brownish in color. This should take about 7 minutes.
10. Add the white rice to the pot and stir to ensure even distribution of the noodles and rice. From here on out follow the directions on the bag of rice. If you are going to salt it do so when you add the water. This step should take about 25 minutes.
11. Serve in a nice serving bowl and enjoy!,

3. Coat the beef evenly in the yogurt mixture and marinade for 8-24 hours.

5. In a large nonstick pan heat the olive oil on high heat. When it starts to smoke very slightly put in three or four pieces of meat -- don't crowd the pan here! -- and brown on both sides about one-two minutes per side.
6. Rest on a plate in a very low oven while you cook the rest of the meat in batches.

time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 350°F Line a 9-inch springform pan with baking parchment.
2. Torte: In a mixing bowl cream the unsalted margarine or butter with the 1/3 cup sugar. Blend in the egg yolks then the mashed sweet potatoes rum extract (if using) and cooled chocolate.
3. In another bowl with clean beaters whip the egg whites gently until they are a bit foamy. Then add in the salt and whip on a higher speed slowly dusting in the two tablespoons of sugar to form stiff glossy (but not dry) peaks. Fold one third of the egg whites into the sweet potato/chocolate mixture and work them in well to loosen the batter. Then gently fold in the remaining egg whites blending well but taking care not to deflate the mixture. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 40 minutes. The cake rises and looks dry and slightly cracked on top when done. The middle should be soft but firm. Cool in the pan for 20 minutes then remove to a wire rack. At this point the cake can be frozen for up to a month. Even if serving it the same day chill the cake for an hour or two before finishing it with the ganache glaze.
4. Chocolate Ganache Glaze: In a double boiler bring the water to a gentle boil and add the chopped chocolate all at once. Remove from the heat and stir briskly with a wire whisk until all the chocolate melts and you have a thick glaze or sauce-like topping. Refrigerate for an hour or so. (You can also make this ahead and refrigerate it for up to a week or two. Simply warm it to the right temperature for glazing the cake.).
5. Invert the cake onto a cardboard circle or cake board so that the smooth flat bottom faces up. Do not be dismayed if this is not a high cake — it is a torte and is meant to be a little less than statuesque. Pour the glaze over the cake and using a metal spatula even out the glaze and spread it along the sides.
6. Instead of the glaze you can also simply sift some cocoa over the top of the cake or decorate it with curls of chocolate (using a vegetable peeler and a warmish chocolate bar). The cake can also be offered with a pureed raspberry or strawberry sauce garnished with chocolate shavings or left as is with a citrus leaf a sweetheart rose or several berries in the center.,

instructions, 1. For the Chickpea Cakes:  Combine all ingredients in a food processor and whiz until you have a fairly uniform mixture but stop before it is completely pureed; keep some texture. You should be able to form it into a ball that holds its shape and should be neither crumbly nor a batter. Add reserved liquid or breadcrumbs as necessary to find the right moisture level.
2. Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a large skillet preferably cast-iron over a medium-high flame. Take a golf-ball sized piece of dough press it in your hands into a flattened 3-inch patty and place in the skillet. Repeat with as many as will fit comfortably without touching. Fry on one side until golden brown about 3 minutes then flip and brown the other side. Remove to paper towels and finish with a little bit of sea salt.  Serve with Tomato Jam.
3. To Make Tomato Jam:  Combine the tomatoes onion lemon juice basil honey and salt in a saucepan. Add a couple dashes of cayenne pepper and black pepper. Bring to a simmer (Michael notes that you don’t need to worry about adding water as the tomatoes will produce plenty of liquid as they cook). Once simmering adjust the heat on the stove to keep the tomatoes simmering until the mixture becomes thick and syrupy about an hour. Taste and adjust seasonings. Serve at room temperature. Can be refrigerated up to three days.  Makes about 1 cup.,

instructions, 1. For the filling mix together a fresh collection of rinsed but raw rice tomatoes green onion mint parsley olive oil salt and pepper.
2. Most recipes have you cook the rice ahead of time but I found some that use raw rice and I love how it eliminates several steps and dirty dishes.
3. Now all you need to do is wiggle those stubborn grape leaves out of the jar and begin wrapping them up.
4. To do so place leaf backside up and place a small spoonful of filling by the stem end.
5. Begin to roll the leaf from the stem end. After about one roll fold in the left and right sides.
6. Continue rolling. You don’t need to make them super tight because the rice needs room to expand as it absorbs the liquid.
7. Add potato slices to bottom of pot.
8. Add the grape leaves. Stack them tightly together making one neat layer on top of another.
9. Next top with tomato slices.
10. Pour on the olive oil and any juices at the bottom of the bowl that held the rice.
11. Cover with a plate to keep the grape leaves from floating and unrolling then top off with a lid.
12. Simmer gently for about one hour.
13. This will allow the potatoes at the bottom of the pot to get a nice crust.
14. Add the lemon juice and cook an additional hour (or to taste).You are looking for the rice to be tender inside of the grape leaves. Cut one open to check.
15. I’ve seen several recipes that cook them for upwards of three hours so don’t despair if yours needs longer.
16. Arrange them on a plate.
17. Pile some of the lemony potatoes in the center.
18. Garnish with the cooked and sliced tomatoes as well as a few olives.,

2. Hold a flat metal skewer - not nonstick and at least 12 inches long - point up in one hand. Dip other hand in a bowl of water take a handful of meat mixture and form it around base of skewer in a small sausage shape with pointed ends. Repeat working your way up the skewer. Each skewer should hold three or four kebabs. (You can also just form meat into eight patties.).
3. Lay finished skewers on a sheet pan and smooth kebabs with fingers making sure they are fairly smooth and secured on skewers. Refrigerate at least 1 hour.
4. Prepare charcoal grill or turn gas grill to medium-low. Spray or brush oil on clean grill rack and set within a few inches of the fire. Fire should not be too hot and rack should be at least several inches from heat source.
5. When rack is heated through gently squeeze the kebabs to be sure they are secure on the skewers and place skewers on grill. Meat should start sizzling gently; it should not spit and turn black. Cook undisturbed until deep brown at least 7 minutes. When meat lifts easily from grill slide a spatula under kebabs and turn over. Continue grilling until browned on both sides and juicy but cooked through 10 to 15 minutes total. Serve hot with lemon wedges and pita that has been warmed on the grill. Put a few spoonfuls of salad in each pita with meat.,

Add onion parsley and eggs; process to combine. Transfer mixture to a bowl. Check to see if the mixture can be somewhat formed into balls if it needs more thickness continue adding flour a little at a time until you can work with it.  The mixture will remain soft and pudding-like but you should be able to work with it. (If you do not have a food processor you can use a potato masher and elbow grease).
2. 2. Combine remaining 1/2 cup flour with salt and pepper to taste. Form lentil mixture into 1-1/2-in. balls; coat with seasoned flour.  I found it helpful to coat my hands with the flour to form the balls and that was enough flour to make a nice brown crust on the falafels. Deep fry balls in 350°F oil 3-5 min. or until crisp but fluffy; drain and keep warm.
3. 3. Serve warm with pita and tzatziki.  I also stuffed my pita with some spinach and shredded carrots and it was great.  Get creative and use whatever veggies you have on hand.,

instructions, 1. Clean and wash 3 cups of rice 5 times in warm water.
2. In a saucepan brown the onion garlic and meat in 3 tbs oil (I might use 1 tbs or less). Add tomatoes green beans cinnamon 1 tsp salt 1/4 tsp pepper half of the lime powder. If using canned tomatoes make sure they are completely drained. They must not have any sauce left (I don't always drain it in which case I'll reduce the cooking time of the rice until it feels "al dente"). Cover and simmer over low heat for 40 minutes.
3. Bring 8 cups of water and 2 tbs salt to a boil in a large non-stick pot. Pour the washed and drained rice into the pot. Boil briskly for 6 to 10 minutes over high heat gently stirring twice to loosen any grains that may have stuck to the bottom. Bite a few grains. If the rice feels soft it is ready to be drained. Drain rice in a large fin-mesh colander and rinse in 2 or 3 cups lukewarm water.
4. In the same pot heat 3 tbs oil (I use about 1 tbs or less).
5. In a bowl combine yogurt 2 spatulas of rice and a drop of saffron water. Spread over the bottom of the pot to create a golden crust (tah-dig).
6. Place 2 spatulas full of rice in the pot then add a layer of the green-bean-and-meat mixture. Repeat alternating layers in the shape of a pyramid. Sprinkle the remaining dried lime powder over the pyramid. Cover and cook for 10 minutes over medium heat.
7. Pour the remaining oil(I use a teaspoon or so) saffron water and 1/2 cup of the meat juices over the rice. Place a clean dish towel or 2 layers of paper towels oved the pot and cover firmly with the lid to prevent steam from escaping. Cook 50 minutes longer over low heat. remove the pot from heat and allow to cool for 5 minutes on a damp surface without uncovering it to free the crust from the bottom of the pot.
8. Open the pot take out 2 tablespoons of the saffron-flavored rice and set aside for garnishing.
9. Gently taking 1 spatula full of rice at a time place it on a serving platter without disturbing the crust. Mound the rice in the shape of a cone. Decorate with saffron-flavored rice.
10. Detach the crust from the bottom of the pot using a wooden spatula. Unmold onto a small platter and serve on the side.,
