3. Note 1: Small artichokes need virtually no trimming but the larger ones need some trimming.  Prepare a large bowl of cold water and the juice of one lemon. For each artichoke cut off all but about an inch of the stem and the sharp ends of the leaves (if they are in fact sharp) and pull off any outer leaves that are not tender. Using a sharp paring knife peel the base of the artichoke and then the stem. Cut each artichoke in half and using a teaspoon scoop out the choke. As you trim each artichoke place it in the bowl of lemon water. The very smallest artichokes are so tender that they require neither peeling nor de-choking.
4. Note 2:  Use Japanese seven spice.  It contains ground red pepper mandarin orange peel sesame seed poppy seed hemp seed nori ground Sichuan peppers.  Or substitute with cayenne and ginger.,

instructions, 1. In a large mixing bowl for every 4 chicken breasts add 1 1/2 cups flour 3 tablespoons of corn starch 2 teaspoons of baking powder mix well. (i.e. if you want to double the chicken then double the batter recipe accordingly)
2. Make a well in the center of dry mixture and add 3 to 4 tbsp of soy sauce a few sprinkles of ground ginger 6 to 8 drops of sesame oil 1 beaten egg and ½ to 2/3 cup of water.
3. Begin mixing the mixture with your hands or whisk making sure the wet and dry ingredients blend together to make a thick paste-like coating. Add more water and/or more flour if batter looks too thick/thin.
4. Once mixture is uniform add the chicken pieces. Your goal here is to coat the pieces so that when they are fried the batter around them will be uniform. Once the consistency is right (like thick pancake batter) place chicken and batter in the fridge and let it sit for at least 20 minutes.
5. Prepare the sauce: In a medium sauce pot bring to a boil one cup of chicken broth. When broth is boiling add to it 1 cup of sugar and ¼ to ½ of a cup of white vinegar. Mix well.
6. Turn heat to low and allow the sugar and vinegar to jive nicely in the broth. Then add a few drops of sesame oil the smashed garlic cloves and (depending on how hot you like it) add 1 to 3 teaspoons of hot pepper sauce or hot chili peppers or dried hot red peppers.
7. Mix well and allow mixture to simmer on low for 5 minutes. Dissolve corn starch in cold water. Whisk well. Stir over medium heat until sauce begins to thicken. It's important to taste the sauce. Some people like it sweeter some like it with more of a vinegar taste some like it hotter. Adjust it to your personal liking.
8. Allow to simmer on low for 10 minutes or until thick (honey-like). Remove from heat. The house is starting to smell good now.
9. In a large frying pan heat oil (about 1-inch thick). Once the oil is HOT begin dropping each piece of chicken INDIVIDUALLY into the oil. They will quickly puff up and begin to brown.
10. Remove chicken from the oil using a slotted (metal) spoon once it is thoroughly browned and done. It will have a nice tan color…not too brown but not pale either.
11. Allow chicken to drain on paper towels until all chicken has been cooked.
12. Place the chicken in a beautiful serving dish and pour the sauce on top; mix.
13. Serve with steamed rice or fabulous chinese noodles. Sprinkle chicken with lots of sesame seeds. Serve and enjoy.,

instructions, 1. Peel the ginger using a sharp-edged teaspoon (or a small knife) -- yep that is the easiest way just scrape it toward you and all comes off. In the joints just break apart the pieces to get all the peeling.
2. Now slice it in 1/4-inch-thick slices -- I used the Cuisinart since I was doing so much but you can use a mandoline or sharp knife.
3. Place the slices in a large nonreactive saucepan with cold water to cover bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes. Drain cover with fresh cold water boil and again cook 15 minutes. Repeat this blanching process 2 more times for a total of 4 blanchings in all.
4. After the last blanching drain and cover with 6 cups of fresh cold water and 3 cups of sugar. Slowly bring the syrup to a boil stirring often then reduce heat and simmer stirring occasionally until the ginger is translucent and the syrup is thickened about 20-30 minutes; watch carefully. Remove from heat.
5. You now have Canton candied ginger and can store it this way (in it's syrup in a sterilized jar with a tight fitting lid and refrigerated) for practically forever.
6. Or for crystallized ginger let stand for about 30 minutes for the ginger to absorb more syrup. Then you can take the pieces of ginger from the syrup and toss it in granulated sugar and put it on a rack (or on a parchment lined baking sheet) to dry uncovered at room temperature for at least 8 hours or overnight until the sugar coating is firm and the slices are no longer sticky. This also keeps for at least a year stored in a cool dry place in an airtight container.
7. Notes: Save the syrup for flavoring it has a strong ginger flavor and can be used to flavor drinks-- it is so yummy! I also save the sugar that I tossed it in to use in recipes.,

3. Remove from water and mince adding salt in 3 batches as you mince. The idea is to get the water & juices out of the green peppers.
4. Squeeze juices from the green pepper so they are dry. If you squeeze the juice into a bowl you can use them in stock or to moisten other food etc.
5. Put 1 heaping Tablespoon of green pepper into a dumpling wrapper and seal. You may need more or less depending on the size of your wrappers.
6. Cook according to package directions.
7. Make the sauce by peeling ginger and cutting into thin matchsticks. Add the soy wine and balsamic vinegar to the ginger.
8. Put chili peppers in a small bowl Heat oil in a small pan and add it to a bowl with the chili peppers in it. Let it sit until the oil is cool. This makes chili oil. Add as much as desired to the rest of the sauce. Portion sauce into small shallow individual bowls/saucers.

instructions, 1. Cut the cabbage across into thin strips. Mix with 2 teaspoons salt and set aside for 5 minutes. Squeeze out the excess moisture.
2. In a large bowl mix the celery cabbage pork green onions wine cornstarch the remaining 1 teaaspoon salt 1 teaspoon sesame oil and the white pepper.
3. **In a bowl mix the flour and 1 cup boiling water until a soft dough forms. Knead the dough on a lightly flour surface about 5 minutes or until smooth.
4. Divide the dough in half. Shape each half into a roll 12 inches long and cut each roll into 1/2-inch slices.
5. Roll 1 slice of dough into a 3-inch circle and place 1 tablespoon pork mixture in the center of the circle. Lift up the edges of the circle and pinch 5 pleats up to create a pouch to encase the mixture. Pinch the top together. Repeat with the remaining slices of dough and filling.
6. Heat a wok or nonstick skillet until very hot. Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil tilting the wok to coat the sides. If using a nonstick skillet add 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil. Place 12 dumplings in a single layer in the wok and fry 2 minutes or until the bottoms are golden brown.
7. Add 1/2 cup water. Cover and cook 6 to 7 minutes or until the water is absorbed. Repeat with the remaining dumplings.
8. To make a dipping sauce in a small bowl mix the soy sauce with 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Serve with the dumplings.
9. NOTE: The dough was VERY sticky. So I had to use a lot of flour on it when rolling it out. Just make sure you don't use too much. I also didn't have wine on hand so didn't use it. I found that the meat inside was more like a meatball and not saucy or mushy like I think it should have been (maybe because I didn't use the wine?). Also when cooking be very careful as they do seem to fall apart unless you make the pieces of dough thicker and a tad larger. I only hope that by posting this here someone can come up with ideas on how to make the meat more mushy I've tried other recipes for the dumpling portion and it just didn't taste as good.,

instructions, 1. In a saucepan with a good fitting lid bring water salt and optional ingredients if desired to a boil.  The salt and butter are simply for flavor. The vinegar keeps your grains separated and gives you a prettier dish. No one will taste the vinegar at all!
2. Add rice and stir.
3. Cover and reduce heat to medium low. You will know that your temperature is correct if a little steam is visible leaking from the lid. A lot of steam means your heat is too high.
4. Cook for 20 minutes.
5. DO NOT LIFT LID!
6. The steam that is trapped inside the pan is what allows the rice to cook properly.
7. Remove from heat and fluff with fork.

Put a little bit of butter (about 1/2 tbsp) on the top of each chicken breast and drizzle lemon juice as well for extra flavor. Flip chicken breasts over to cook the other side and repeat process.
5. Once the chicken has been fully cooked remove from heat and place onto a platter and allow to rest for 10-15 minutes.

instructions, 1. Boil 1 cup of water; Add 1/4 cup of cold water to the boiled water.
2. Put 3 cups of flour into a large bowl; Slowly pour approximately 1 cup of the hot water into the flour and stir the bowl while you pour.
3. Knead until all of the flour in the bowl has joined the dough; (It may seem like there is too little water at first but be patient; The dough will be kind of hot when kneading; When you are done your dough should not be sticky and should look grayish).
4. Cover the ball of dough with 2 layers of moist paper towels; Leave covered for at least 1 hour; After an hour or so the dough should have transformed from gray to white; (You can use the wait-time to prepare the next step).
5. Have your chopped onions and cooking oil ready in small bowls; Make sure your rolling pin and rolling board are floured; The steps to follow will need to be repeated until all of the ingredients are used up.
6. Make a ball of dough 6-10 ounces in volume; (6 ounces will give you a pancake the size of a CD and will allow you to o fry 2-3 of them at the same time;) Make sure you re-cover the bowl each time you remove some dough.
7. Use the roller to flatten the ball into a round circle 2-mm thick; Sprinkle salt (you decide how much) uniformly over the'circle;' Use the roller to roll the salt crystals into the dough.
8. Brush a thin amount of cooking oil uniformly over the circle; Then sprinkle 1-2 teaspoons of chopped onion uniformly over the circle; (Read the next step before applying the onions so as to better understand how much onions to apply).
9. Roll the circle into a cylinder; (If you put too much onion it won't roll well) Gently squeeze as much air out of the'cylinder' as you can; Pinch the ends so the onions wont fall out; (If the sides of your cylinder start popping holes you made the circle too thin but don't worry).
10. Roll the cylinder along the length and tuck the outer-end into the roll; Your creation should look like a snail shell and be shaped like a rollerskate wheel.
11. Rest the'wheel' on its face and use your roller to flatten it into a pancake around 4-5 mm thick; Don't be worried if onions start spilling out when you flatten.
12. Brush your frying pan with cooking oil and fry on low heat; Turn when the bottom is crispy; The final pancake should be crispy on the outside with a few burn spots on the surface and dense and chewy on the inside.
13. I recommend tasting the first one to decide if you want to add more salt or onion or if you want to make the pancake thicker or thinner.,

instructions, 1. Make the filling: Stir the bananas sugar cinnamon and coconut together in a small bowl lightly mashing the bananas as you mix. The mixture should still be a little chunky.
2. Make the sauce: In a small sauce pan bring the milk and coconut milk to a boil then remove from the heat.
3. Beat the egg yolks and sugar together in a medium bowl until pale yellow and smooth 2 to 3 minutes. Stirring constantly gradually pour half of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolk mixture then stir the yolk mixture into the milk mixture remaining in the pan. Over medium heat stir the milk mixture constantly until thickened about 2 minutes. Strain the sauce into a medium bowl. For extra coconut flavor add the 1/2 cup flaked coconut (I prefer it smooth!). Let cool to room temperature then cover the bowl and chill until cold. (I like the sauce at room temp.).
4. Wontons: Place a heaping teaspoonful of the filling in the center of one of the wonton wrappers. (Keep the remaining wrappers covered with a damp kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out.) Moisten the edges of the wrapper with a fingertip dipped in water then fold the wrapper in half to form a triangle. Pinch the edges together firmly to seal. Pull the opposite corners of the base of the triangle moisten one of the corners with water and press the two corners firmly to seal. Repeat with the remaining wontons and filling keeping the folded wontons covered with a damp kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out.
5. Pour enough vegetable oil into a wok or 2 quart saucepan to come to a depth of 3 inches. Heat the oil over medium heat to 350°F Slip a few of the wontons into the oil and fry turning occasionally until golden brown 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining wontons. Serve hot or cold with the coconut cream sauce.,

2. Add a pinch or two of salt.
3. Then add the uncooked pasta when the water is starting to boil.
4. Stir occasionally so that it doesn't stick.
5. This takes about 20 minutes to cook.

7. Wait until the pan is warm before adding the oil. (Any oil will do).
8. Wait until the oil is heated before adding the diced onions. Put medium heat.
9. Sautee about 5 minutes or until golden brown before adding the ground beef.
10. Takes about 15 minutes to cook the beef. Drain the fat and majority of the liquid. (The fat will float on top of the sauce later on because it doesn't mix well so you do have to drain).
11. Throw in the hoison and ketchup- mix together.
12. Taste the sauce to see if you want it to be sweeter or saltier. You might have to add a little more ketchup or hoison as you go.
13. Turn off the stove if you are happy with the flavor.
14. AND WE'RE BACK TO THE PASTA -- Drain the water out of the pasta.
15. You may add cold water to keep it from sticking but if everyone's eating and you know that there won't be any pasta left you don't have to add cold water so that the pasta will be hot.
16. If you do add cold water drain it before trying to serve. You don't want a wet plate --  if ya know what I mean *insert wink*.
17. SERVING THE FOOD. Put desired amount of pasta on plate.
18. Put desired amount of sauce over the pasta. Don't put too much because it will get VERY saucy (if you know what I mean *insert 2 winks*).
19. ENJOY! *This step is required*.,

2. The sauce is in the Chinese food section of the supermarket.  I like Lee Kum Kee brand.
3. One side of the ribs is meaty and 1 side is a thin membrane.  Pre-heat the oven to 160 deg C and use a drip tray or alfoil. Apply about 1/3 of the jar to the membrane side and bake this side up for about 30 minutes It has to be on a rack so the heat can come from underneath without stewing the meat. Pull out and turn meaty side up apply another 1/3 or a bit more to the ribs and cook another 30 mins or so.  The edges should be a bit black when they are done.  Eat pref with corn bread and coleslaw.  Wear an old shirt !,

5. Cook the pork for 3-4 minutes until the broth comes to a boil again.
6. Add the tofu mushroom pieces bamboo shoots and day lilies.
7. Let the pot return to a boil then reduce heat to maintain a low boil.
8. Add the soy sauce spices vinegar salt and sugar.

10. Mix the corn starch and water to create a paste for thickening.
11. Add the corn starch mixture slowly stirring constantly.
12. Drizzle the beaten eggs in slowly while stirring so that you get "strings" of egg.
13. Turn off the heat.
14. Presentation -- ladle the soup into bowls then garnish with 1/2 tsp of scallion per bowl and a drizzle of sesame oil.
15. Comments on ingredients & substitutions:
16. Dried lily pods and wood ears (also called "tree ears" "black fungus" or "Hu Bei") available in most oriental markets.
17. Chicken stock -- use home made or a low sodium canned variety. For Vegetarians use a Vegetarian Chicken stock or a Vegetable Stock.
18. Pork -- For kosher alternative use shredded chicken or turkey; for vegetarian alternative replace pork with a mix of fresh flavorful mushrooms e.g. shiitake oyster or portobellos.
19. Soy sauce -- Betty uses regular soy sauce -- if using a "lite soy" variety you may have to adjust the amount of salt to taste.
20. Vinegar -- the vinegar is the essence of the "sour" aspect of this soup and distilled white vinegar gives you the strongest taste; rice vinegars wine vinegars apple cider vinegars etc will either be too dilute (not enough acidity) or add extraneous flavors.
21. Garlic -- garlic powder is preferred in this recipe but if you choose to use cloves leave them whole add them only to flavor the chicken broth and remove them before adding other ingredients.
22. Sesame oil -- adds a shimmer and smoky flavor to the final product. Chinese sesame oil is typically from toasted seeds; Japanese is typically untoasted so the flavor will be subtly different.,

2. Rinse eggplant. Trim and julienne as picture shown. Soak in water with a bit of salt dissolved for a while. Drain well. Marinate pork mince for 20 minutes.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a clay pot over medium. Sauté half of the minced garlic shallot ginger and chili bean sauce. Add eggplant and stir fry constantly. Also add hot water bit by bit all the way of stir frying. Don’t add too much water at a time just add small amount to avoid burning or sticking to the bottom of clay pot. Coat the eggplant with sauce evenly then add some boiling water to simmer until eggplants softened.
4. While stir frying the eggplant use another frying pan to heat some cooking oil. Add another half of minced garlic shallot ginger and chili bean sauce until aromatic. Add pork and stir fry until cooked.
5. When the eggplant is softened toss the minced pork in clay pot. Stir fry quickly. Turn heat to medium. Add seasoning and continue to cook. Bring it to boil. Add thickening to your preference. Serve hot.
6. Note:
7. It’s not necessary to soak the julienned eggplant in water with salt. But this step would help to remove its bitterness and keep its purple colour fresh from cooking. Or simply peel off the skin instead.,

instructions, 1. In a medium bowl cream together the sugar and shortening. Stir in the egg and vanilla then beat until light and fluffy.
2. Combine the cake flour baking soda and salt.  Stir into the creamed mixture until well-blended.  The dough will be stiff so you may need to use your hands to mix depending on the strength of your mixer.
3. Roll dough into a log about 15 inches long (or 2 narrower logs about 10-12 inches each).  If you find the dough falling apart too much knead one teaspoon of milk at a time into the dough until it will hold up to shaping.
4. If desired you can coat the log with ground nuts or colored or chocolate sprinkles before chilling and slicing.  Beat the egg egg white or yolk with a tablespoon of water brush over the log then roll the log in your choice of coating pressing them in a bit.
5. Red and green sprinkles mixed together and used to edge the vanilla cookies is really nice around the holidays.  Instructions for marble cookies are given below.
6. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap or wax paper and refrigerate for about 1/2 hour.  If you chill them longer let the log sit out for a bit before slicing or the dough will be too hard and may crumble.
7. To bake preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease cookie sheets.
8. Unwrap dough and using a very thin sharp knife cut into 1/2 inch slices.  This dough is a bit difficult to work with and may tend to crumble.  If it does let it warm up a bit more before slicing.
9. Place cookies 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets.  If you prefer gently adjust the edges of the cookies to make them as close to a circle as possible.  Lightly press a chocolate star walnut half or any other similar addition in the center of each cookie.
10. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until just barely browned around the edges and the middle has set.  If making the smaller cookies bake for 9-12 minutes.
11. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before removing to a cooling rack.
12. One possible variation is melting some chocolae chips with a small bit of vegetable shortening and then piping a star onto the center of each baked and cooled cookie then putting them in the refrigerator until the chocolate is set.
13. TO MAKE MARBLE COOKIES::
14. Divide the finished dough in half and add 1/3 to 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and 1-2 tablespoons of milk to one of the halves and blend well. Roll both flavors out to separate logs then put one on top of the other and press lightly together.  Twist in a few places and and fold the dough over on itself once or twice to marble the dough but not too much because you want a nice distinct marble with a bit of thin delicate swirls here and there and look really nice once they're baked.  Then roll into one or two logs chill slice and bake as directed above.
15. For Christmas try separating the dough into 3 or 4 parts coloring one red one green and one chocolate leaving a 4th section plain and then marbleing.  For Halloween use orange coloring instead of plain marbled with chocolate dough.  These look great with a chocolate star placed or piped onto the center of the cookie.
16. These cookies are nice and crisp without being hard and will keep well kept in a covered plastic container or plastic bag.,

We used some very spicy Wild Garlic that had very small cloves so that’s why I could only give a guess on how much you will need to buy. .
2. █Breading█.
3. ●In a medium to large mixing bowl add the 6 Eggs and 1 cup Corn Startch. Mix as smooth as you can.
4. ●Cut the Chicken Breast in to bite size pieces and add in to the breading mixture. Mixing the pieces inches.
5. ●Cover and refridgerate about 30mins (this step can be skipped if you prefer) It seems to help the breading adhere better if refridgerate.
6. █Sauce█.
7. ●In a small mixing bowl mix the 8 tsp Corn Startch 6 tbs Sugar and 2 tbs Cayenne Pepper.
8. ● In the same small mixing bowl now add and mix in the 8 tbs Sherry Wine 6 tbs Rice Vinegar and 1 cup Soy Sauce.
9. ●In the same bowl add the Sliced Garlic you sat aside earlier.
10. ●Now sat this bowl aside for later.
11. █Cooking█.
12. ●Add Vegetable Oil to a deep frying pan and turn on high heat Make sure the oil is high enough to cover the chicken. After its hot we start cooking the chicken.
13. ●While the Oil is heating set up a plate (cookie sheet in my case) with paper towel on it. This is where your going to move the chicken to as it gets done in the oil.
14. ●Use tongs to add a piece of chicken at a time making sure they don't stick to each other.
15. ●Take pieces out as they get a nice light brown coating and put on the paper towel. Adding more chicken as space allows.
16. ●I normally start the rice at these point so it will be done a little before the chicken.
17. █Final Cooking with Sauce█.
18. ●After all the chicken is done cooking pour the Sauce in a large frying pan and cook on medium heat till the sauce start thickening stirring constantly (doesn't take long).
19. ●After about half the Sauce has thickened add the Chicken mixing it in with the Sauce.
20. ●After fully mixed serve up the chicken on a bed of rice.,

instructions, 1. Rinse the chicken. Crush the ginger and put it in the chicken.
2. Wait for the water in the pot to boil. Once boiling stick the chicken in it. Make sure that the water covers the whole chicken. Boil for up to 15-20 minutes. Make sure that it’s fully cooked.
3. While waiting for the chicken to cook. Wash the uncooked rice in water. Drain in a strainer. Let stand for 5 minutes till there is no more dripping water.
4. Heat a frying pan melt the margarine and throw in garlic. Fry till fragrant do not brown the garlic. Put in the uncooked rice. Mix.
5. Put in the salt pepper chicken stock and saffron powder (The saffron powder is what makes the rice yellow. so adjust depending on how yellow You want the rice to be).
6. Once everything is mixed well take out of frying pan and put it into a rice cooker.
7. For easy way to measure the water to rice ratio use your index finger to measure the depth of the rice and remember where it hits on your finger. (I like to use my thumb resting against my index finger to mark the level). Then simply rest your index finger on top of the rice and add water until it hits the same spot on your finger as the rice did before. But for yellow rice the rice should be a little grainier so only put in a little less water.
8. Put the Pandan leaf in with the rice and let it cook. If the rice comes out too grainy for your taste just add a little more water and press the cook button again.
9. Your chicken should be ready by now take out the chicken put in a bowl. Rub the whole chicken with the sesame oil. (Save the soup).

instructions, 1. Heat the oil in a 2-quart saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Add the onion and saute until softened but not browned.
2. Add the rice and cook stirring until the rice has absorbed the oil and is lightly golden. Add the wine and cook until the rice has absorbed the wine. Add the stock cover and turn the heat to low. Cook without peeking until the rice is done about 15 minutes. Keep warm.
3. While the rice is cooking chop the garlic with the salt until it is almost a paste. The salt will bring the juices out of the garlic and help with the chopping as well as season the rice.
4. When the rice is done fluff it with a chopstick or fork. Stir in as much of the garlic paste as you have the nerve for. Stir in the spinach and replace the lid for 5 minutes; the spinach will steam with the heat from the rice. Serve as soon as possible.,

Increase heat to maximum and carefully add 1 cup of the water and allow it to simmer. When it starts to simmer add the rice stir and add the rest of the water. (at this point you should test for salt it should be a bit saltier than you'd prefer because the beans and rice will absorb most of it). Bring to a boil.
3. When it starts to boil reduce heat to the lowest possible and cover with a lid.

instructions, 1. In a food processor blend black beans and kidney beans to a fine mash. It is alright if some bean chunks still remain solid.
2. In a large mixing bowl add to bean mash any desired spices. I strongly reccomend liberal amounts of chili powder cumin onion powder and garlic powder. You might also add an adobo seasoning.
3. Should you desire you might add any kind of chopped or shredded vegetables at this point. From experience I find salsa is a nice addition.
4. Mix in 1.5 cups of cooked brown rice into bean mash and stir till even consistancy. Gradually fold in entire package bread crumbs- bean mash will visibly thicken it is advisable to use your hands at this point.
5. Grab small palmfulls of bean mix and flatten into burger sized patties. I generally find I make about 28 patties in one go- this is variable as yours may be smaller or larger.
6. I freeze patties for weeks (months) at a time in an air-tight container or freezer bag.
7. To cook- either bake in a toaster oven until exterior is crusty and crispy or pan fry with a small amount of oil or cooking spray. These are very firm burgers and will hold up extremly well- better than any other bean burger ive seen!
8. Dress your burgers with any number or great things- BBQ suace is a particular favorite.
9. Also try crumbling cooked burgers and using the 'meat' as taco filling- tastes delicious especially with taco sauce.,

instructions, 1. Consult the packaging on your wild rice for actual cooking directions following the ratio  of 2 parts water to 1 part orange juice. These directions match my rice.  Add water and juice to a medium sauce pan and bring to a boil.  Add wild rice and let it return to a boil.  Lower to just simmering and cover.  Cook 60 minutes.  Check at about 45 minutes and if the mix seems a little dry add a bit more water.
2. Toast the pecans on an ungreased cookie sheet for 5-7 minutes in the oven at 375 degrees.  Allow to cool and give them a coarse chop.
3. Rinse and clean the baby spinach removing stems. Cut into ribbons about 1/2 inch thick.
4. Once the rice is cooked allow it to cool a bit about 20 minutes.  You want it to lightly wilt the spinach but not actually cook it.
5. Mix the spinach cranberies and pecans into the wild rice.  If youa re serving that day you can store on the counter.  Otherwise place in fridge until ready to serve.
6. To prepare the dressing whisk all ingredients together in a small bowl.
7. A half hour before serving toss the salad and dressing together. Let stand so that the flavors can meld together.,

instructions, 1. These directions are long because I am covering the method quite thoroughly for new-comers.  (-;.
2. SOAK BEANS:  On Sunday night (or the night before you want to eat these yummy beans) check beans to be sure there are no stones then place beans in a large bowl and fill almost to the top with water.  It's better to have too much water than not enough.  The beans will more than double in size overnight. In the morning I drain beans in a colander and rinse well.
3. A FEW PERSONAL TRICKS:  One of the first things I do in the morning is fill my Crockpot with hot tap water just to bring it up to temperature much faster.  This saves on cooking time and electricity.  I also fill and boil my electric jug (or kettle) - this is the water I will use to cook my beans.
4. PLACE IN CROCKPOT:  Beans ham hock black pepper chicken stock powder chopped garlic garlic salt bay leaves and optional Chipotle powder and liquid smoke. Note: Save adding salt until the end of cook time.
5. COVER WITH HOT WATER:  Cover beans with hot water from your jug or kettle just until fully covered.  Then add an extra inch of water on top of that.  This will give your beans a chance to swell even more during cooking.  Cover Crockpot with lid.
6. QUICKLY:  Sauté onions and bell-pepper just until they begin to cook.  Add these to the beans and stir.
7. COOK:  If you are going to be gone all day cook beans on low setting for 6 to 8 hours.  If you will be around to stir etc. I recommend cooking them on high until they are almost fully cooked (about 4 or 5 hours).  Then turn them down to low for the last bit of cooking.
8. ONCE COOKED:  When beans are fully cooked remove bay leaves (if you can find them all) add butter and stir.  To thicken beans add 2 tablespoons corn flour mixed with just enough cold water to dissolve it.  Add this to beans and stir for a minute.  Beans should thicken a bit in fairly short order.  Repeat until you get the desired consistency.
9. ADD:  Add salt by half-teaspoon until you reach the level of your liking.  It may not take much for you.  Also add a bit more fresh ground pepper.
10. NOW:  Put your rice on to cook.  Slice smoked sausage and cook in a medium-hot cast iron skillet until nicely brown and starting to emit those nice juices.  Take skillet off heat but leave sausages where they are.  Don't cover.
11. RINSE your rice with hot water.  Once drained place about half a cup of hot fluffy rice in a wide shallow bowl.
12. COVER rice with a generous amount of red beans.  Top with a good amount of hot smoked sausage slices.
13. SPRINKLE with hot sauce and/or more Tony's if you want it spicy like I do.
14. SERVE with hot buttered grilled slices of French bread salad or coleslaw and a big glass of iced tea.
15. ENJOY!
16. EDIT - December 2016 - I'd like to address the review comments regarding mashing your beans to thicken them. The reason I don't do that is because I don't want to lose any of my beans though I do that if I make a double batch. These freeze so well (without rice).  Also for re-heating I put beans in a pot on the stove (medium/low) and add small amounts of water to thin them out a bit. They are much better juicy! The beans are very forgiving but they do need that added moisture when being re-heated. And I'd also like to say I am so humbled by all the comments - a BIG thank you to everyone who has reviewed these humble red beans!,

instructions, 1. Bring all refrigerated ingredients to room temperature. Grease a 5 x 9-inch loaf pan.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer combine eggs oil and lemon juice. In a large measuring cup combine water 1 tablespoon sugar and yeast; let stand for 5 minutes or until foamy. In a medium bowl combine tapioca starch flour brown rice flour dry milk powder xanthan gum salt flax seed and 3 tablespoons sugar. Add yeast mixture to the egg mixture then slowly add dry ingredients a little at a time until completely incorporated. Mix batter on high speed for 31/2 minutes then pour into prepared pan.
3. Cover bread with foil and place in a cold oven. Set a pan of hot water on a lower shelf underneath the bread. Leave for 10 minutes with oven door closed. (This will cause the tread to rise quickly.) Remove bread from oven (do not uncover) and place in a warm place in the kitchen.
4. Preheat I oven to 400°F Bread will continue to rise as oven preheats.
5. Uncover bread and bake for 10 minutes to brown the top. Cover bread with foil and continue to bake bread for 30 minutes. Turn bread out onto a cooling rack. When completely cooled wrap tightly to maintain freshness for as long as possible.
6. TIPS: If humidity is high reduce the amount of water in the recipe to avoid over rising. Many gluten-free bakers experience the frustrating situation in which a beautiful loaf of bread deflates once removed from the oven. You will need to experiment a little to get just the right amount of water in your bread depending on the humidity in the air. If in question use less water than the recipe calls for.
7. You may use rapid rise yeast instead of regular yeast. If doing so eliminate the cold oven rise method with a pan of hot water follow yeast package directions instead for rise time.
8. Hamburger Buns.
9. Pour batter into English muffin rings follow directions above. Bake for just 15 minutes. Once completely cooled these buns freeze well. Always serve buns warmed otherwise they will be crumbly.,

instructions, 1. Step 1:  RINSE THE RICE.  Put the three cups of rice in a large bowl.  Lightly rinse the rice by adding enough cold water to half fill the bowl and swirl it around with the rice.  Rinse it swirl it again and drain again and again.  Scrunch the rice about in the bowl with your hands while rinsing it --  this should take 3 or 4 attempts. Transfer the rinsed rice into a large saucepan.  Pour in 3 and 1/3 cups of water and leave it to soak for at least 30 minutes.  As it soaks the rice will become whiter and water clear.
2. Step 2.  PREPARE THE SUSHI VINEGAR. Put half a cup of rice vinegar quarter of a cup of sugar a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of powdered Dashi into the small saucepan.  Heat gently and stir to ensure that the sugar and salt dissolve.  Don't let the mixture boil as it will impair the flavor.  Only heat long enough to dissolve.  Let it cool while you prepare the rice.
3. Step 3.  COOK THE RICE.  Put the lid securely on top and turn the heat to high.  Avoid lifting the lid at all times through out the cookin process as this will allow the steam to escape. When the rice begins to boil reduce the heat and leave it to simmer for 15 minutes.  After the fifteen minutes are up turn off the heat and leave the rice to stand for another 15 minutes.
4. Step 4.  STIR IN THE SUSHI VINEGAR.  Transfer rice into a large wooden bowl.  *I use a glass one and it works fine* Pour the cooled sushi vinegar over the rice.  Use a flat spatula in a cutting motion to fold the mixture into the rice.  While you are folding use your other hand to fan the rice.  You want to bring that rice to room temperature while folding.
5. Step 5.  READY TO SERVE.  It's best to use the rice immediately.  It should be shiny and sticky with each grain separated and not mashed together. It should be used at room temperature.  If you don't need it straight away cover the bowl with a damp cloth.  This will prevent it from becoming to hard.

instructions, 1. Measure 1 1/2 cups cooked cold rice into a big bowl. (You can use rice up to a week old but any older than that is too old to eat.).
2. Use a fork or potato masher to mash the rice for a minute or two. This is a tiny bit of a nuisance but it is what gives the pancakes their special texture. After the rice has been mashed a little then add the rest of the ingredients. Use a whisk to stir everything up until it makes a light and creamy batter. If you want to use yogurt as your milk product the batter may be very thick depending on the thickness of your yogurt. Water may be added to thin the batter. Use your best judgment if the batter seems very thick to you.
3. Fry these in a hot skillet or griddle turning them whenever they are brown on the bottom. Use about 1/4 cup batter per pancake to keep them small and manageable. They are so tender that frying big ones is a little tricky so keep them on the smallish side.,

instructions, 1. In a large heatproof bowl pour boiling water over the rice enough to cover. Stir only once and let stand 10 minutes.
2. Transfer to a colander over the sink and rinse rice under cold water. Drain again. Set rice aside spread out on a cookie sheet to dry slightly. (I usually do this first thing in the morning.).
3. In the meantime put the tomatoes onion garlic and half of chili pepper into a food processor or blender. Process until smooth like salsa. Set tomato mixture aside.
4. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large heavy saute pan and cook rice until a light golden brown color. Stir constantly so that rice does not burn scraping bottom of pan with spatula because the rice grains will stick.
5. Next add the pureed tomato mixture and keep stirring over medium heat until all the liquid is absorbed about 10 minutes. If mixture starts to boil reduce heat. *Stir in the stock salt and green peas. Continue to cook the mixture on low-medium heat stirring occasionally until all liquid is absorbed and rice is tender another 10-15 minutes. Be careful not to burn.
6. *NOTE: DO NOT stir rice too often after adding the stock or the grains will become too starchy.
7. The original directions say to remove pan from heat cover with tight-fitting lid; letting stand in a warm place 10 minutes or so. I remove pan from heat cover and place pan in low oven at approximately 150-200 degrees. Sometimes I'll let the rice set in the oven for a good hour or longer as long as the rice grains are tender and rice doesn't dry out too much.
8. Transfer the cooked rice to a serving platter fluff with fork and serve sprinkled with freshly ground black pepper. Garnish with thinly sliced chilis or serve on side.,

3. In a large pot over medium heat combine broth and chicken. Bring to a boil then stir in rice. Cover and remove from heat.
4. In a medium saucepan over medium heat melt butter. Add carrots celery and onion and saute for 5 minutes. Stir in contents of seasoning packet and continue cooking vegetables until softened about 5 minutes more. Add seasoned flour gradually while constantly stirring to form a roux. Saute roux for 3-4 minutes to cook out raw flour taste.
5. Whisk in cream a little at a time until fully incorporated and smooth. Cook until thickened 5 minutes.
6. Stir cream mixture into broth and rice. Cook over medium heat until heated through and rice is done15-20 minutes.
7. Alternatively for those who cannot get the quick-cooking version of the rice I have put the broth on to boil and cooked the 25-minute version of long grain and wild rice blend according to the directions while sauteeing the veggies in the butter. I tend to cook the veggies longer this way and I like them quite soft. I then follow the rest of the directions above adding the rice/broth to the cream mixture. I've also used fat-free half and half with no appreciable difference in flavor. Enjoy!,

7. Brown rice modification:  Same as normal but add 1/2 cup more liquid.  Times would be 50 minutes in a skillet.  Add 30-60 minutes to crock pot times.
8. Modern version:  Substitute 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter (or heart smart spread) for the margarine.  Use brown rice.  Use low sodium chicken or vegetable stock in place of the bouillon and water (organic optional).  Use low sodium soy sauce.  And --  it will still taste good.  Cooking methods sure have changed!,

3. VARIATION: This dish can be improved through the use of any flavorful stock (chicken ham vegetables dry white wine etc.) rather than the water.  Also for added flavor as dish simmers consider adding 1/2 cup sliced pimiento-stuffed olives 1 teaspoon ground oregano and/or 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin.
4. NOTE: To cook yellow rice just cook rice as you would normally do but add a drop or 2 of yellow food color.  In Key West most cooks use an inexpensive condiment called BIJOL which gives rice a rich yellow color.,

2. As a stuffing:  Stuff into cornish hen or turkey and bake until bird is done.  I serve the stuffing still inside the hen but I take it out of the turkey and sometimes bake the rice a bit more for the added crisp. (My family likes crispy rice :) ).
3. To crispify: Throw the bowl into the oven at 350 for 8-10 minutes or until it's slightly crispy on top.
4. As a side dish I mix as above and add peas and serve.  I imagine the rice would work well mixed with other veggies but we just love our peas so much that it's normally what I add.  Trust me and use real butter and don't omit.,

instructions, 1. First of all wash the rice then place it on to a tea towel or colander to dry. Then prepare the chicken.Bring enough water to boil in a large pot.Once boil add in the salt gingergarlic and chicken. Lower the heat and cook chicken for about 20 - 25 minutes uncovered. It is very important to boil the chicken very slowly over low flame.Turn of flame and cover the pot. Allow the chicken to steep inside for another 20-25 minutes. Remove chicken and immerse it into a basin of cold water for 5-6 minutes.Take chicken out and drain in a colander to drip dry before cutting it into serving pieces.
2. While the chicken is drip drying prepare the rice.Heat up wok and add in the chicken fat and water.Bring to a low simmering boil until oil is released from the fat. Add in the ginger and garlic and fry well (without burning the garlic) Remove and discard the chicken fat and skin. Add in the rice that has been dried and salt and stir fry briskly about 1 - 2 minutes.Transfer rice into an electric rice cooker or pot. Add in the chicken broth from the boiled chicken together with the screwpine leaves if using.If cooking in a pot cook over low flame stirring occasionally so as not to let the bottom of the rice burn.Boil until rice is cook.
3. While the rice is cooking you can prepare the chilli garlic sauce. Just add all ingredients into a blender or food processor and give it a good whizz until ingredients are well blended. Adjust the seasoning with more salt or sugar to taste.The chili garlic sauce can be kept in the refrigerator for about 2-3 days only.

instructions, 1. A note on ingredients:  a small can of diced green chiles works fine.  The original recipe called for 2 seeded chopped jalapeños so I think any hot pepper would work.  I use the pre-cleaned frozen shrimp and they are fine for this recipe you don't need anything fancy.  If I am making pineapple salad I use fresh pineapple in this recipe.  Otherwise I use canned crushed pineapple.
2. Start by placing the shrimp in a large self-close bag or medium glass bowl.  Add the peppers garlic ginger honey soy sauce and coconut milk.  Allow to marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 4 hours.
3. In a large skillet over medium heat combine olive oil salt onions and bell peppers.  Cook until vegetables become slightly soft but not browned.
4. Turn heat up to high and place the shrimp (not the marinade just the shrimp) in the skillet.  Sauté turning once until shrimp are just slightly browned on the outside and turning pink.  You want them slightly undercooked.
5. Remove shrimp onions and peppers from the skillet.  Pour the marinade into the skillet and bring it to a boil.  Boil it for 5 minutes.  This is long enough to cook the "shrimp juice" that got into the marinade and also to thicken the sauce.
6. Turn the heat off.  Add the shrimp mixture back to the skillet.  Add the basil and green onions.  Toss to combine.  Serve immediately over rice.
7. Rice:
8. In a small covered saucepan combine the rice coconut milk and stock (or water).  Use up the rest of the can of coconut milk and add enough additional liquid to total 1.5 cups.
9. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat.  Cook covered.  Simmer for 12-15 minutes.  Add pineapple.  Fluff with a fork.,

time, ,

instructions, 1. Preparation: Boil several quarts of water in large pot no need to measure. When water comes to a boil add rice and cook until half done (think al dente for pasta) stiring occasionally. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes depending on type of rice.
2. Place strainer in sink and pour in half cooked rice. Run cool water over rice until completely cooled.
3. Place butter in a pot with a lid. Melt butter over medium heat. Pour cold rice over butter. With the end of a wooden spoon (or something like that) make 6-8 holes in the rice all the way to the bottom of the pot (this will help rice steam evenly).
4. Place lid on pot and let cook without peeking for 15 minutes. Check for browning at bottom edge of pan. If rice is not ready cook for another 10-15 minutes. If bottom of rice is lightly browned and rice is cooked turn rice out into a serving bowl and stir gently. If rice is brown but not completely cooked turn heat down to low and cook for another 5-10 minutes. If rice is cooked but not brown turn heat up to medium high and cook until bottom is browned. This step can be difficult to master but the result is crunchy buttery goodness worth practicing for!,

2. Meanwhile heat the oil or bacon grease in a nonstick skillet over medium heat.
3. Grate the cheddar so it will be ready when your eggs are.
4. Fry the egg to the your preferred level of doneness.  I really like it with the yolk still runny so when you cut into the egg on your plate the yolk mixes with the rice and salsa.  This takes about 2 minutes cooking on the first side then I flip it over and cook for about 20-30 seconds on the other side.
5. Spoon the rice onto a plate.
6. Top with the fried eggs.
7. Immediately sprinkle the grated cheddar on top then spoon on the salsa.
8. If you are making more than one serving you won't need to add the whole amount of oil to the skillet for the next servings as some of the oil will still be in the pan.
9. This is an easy weekday breakfast.  On weekends when we want a bigger breakfast we'll also warm up some canned black beans and tortillas to serve on the side.,

2. Whisk together the egg yolk mixture milk cream sugar salt and vanilla in a saucepan until well mixed and yellow. Bring to gentle simmer over medium-low heat and cook the custard stirring constantly for 6 to 8 minutes until the custard thickens (but is not lumpy).
3. Transfer the custard to a bowl and cover with a piece of plastic wrap touching the plastic wrap to the custard’s surface to prevent a skin from forming.
4. Place a sheet of the cold puff pastry dough on a clean work surface and cut the dough in half crosswise. Place one piece on top of the other. Starting from a short side tightly roll up the dough to form a cylinder.
5. Use your hands to roll the dough back and forth a few times so that the dough sheets seal together and then flatten the ends with your hands. Chill in the freezer for 10 minutes to firm up the dough and make it easier to work with.
6. Use a sharp knife to cut the cylinder into 12 equal sections. Place the dough sections flat side down on a work surface and use a rolling pin to roll them into 4-inch disks. Place a disk in the well of a standard-size muffin pan and use your index finger to press the dough directly against the bottom.
7. Taking care not to trap any air bubbles use your fingers to press the dough from the bottom up the sides until the dough reaches the top edge of the muffin well. Repeat with the remaining dough. If the dough becomes too elastic and difficult place it in the freezer for 5 minutes to firm up.
8. Fill each dough cup half full of custard. Bake the tarts for 20 to 25 minutes until their centers are firm and the crusts are golden brown. With the muffins still in the pan place under the broiler and broil them for three minutes or until little burnt spots appear on their tops. Keep an eye on them so they don’t burn too much.

instructions, 1. Wash shrimp and dry well with a paper towel.
2. Chop or grind shrimp very fine (I used my food processor); put into a bowl; add bread salt egg cornstarch sherry and water chestnuts; stir vigorously 1 minute until well mixed.
3. Dip a teaspoon into the cold water then dip spoon into shrimp paste and scoop out enough to form a ball the size of a walnut; repeat this dipping process with each ball it will prevent sticking.
4. Heat the oil to 375° (I used an electric frying pan and it was perfect for keeping the oil at the right temperature) and as you're dipping drop in the balls and fry for about 2-3 minutes turning halfway through.
5. I do about 4-5 at a time if you try to do more the oil temperature will drop too much and your balls will be greasy!
6. Drain on paper towels.
7. Serve hot with peppercorn salt if desired or with any sauce of your choice.
8. Peppercorn Salt:
9. brown peppercorns and salt in a dry frying pan over low heat until fragrance comes out.
10. Place a piece of foil on a flat surface; pour mixture onto foil and fold foil over; crush with a rolling pin.
11. You can make this and store indefinitely in a jar in your pantry.,

instructions, 1. Pre-cook the rice in a medium large pot with the water on medium heat. Normally you should use equal amounts of rice and water but since we are going to fry it in a bit I cook it a little dry so it doesn't get all mushy before its done. Just remember to stir often and keep a close eye on it. Once it absorbs all the water take it off of the heat so it doesn't stick and scorch in the pan. It's precooked!
2. Place your wok on the stove and turn the heat on medium high. Coat the entire inside surface of the wok with olive oil & butter and add enough to cover the bottom about a 1/4 of an inch. Once the oil is starting to get good and hot toss in the pre-cooked rice. Let this sizzle and stir for a moment and then make a well in the bottom for the onions garlic and eggs. Add a little oil if needed. Brown the onions garlic and eggs and then stir the rice back in on top of it. Keep stirring and mixing until the eggs are thoroughly cooked. Add in the soy sauce and mix it some more. Keep stirring and don't let any rice stick on the bottom too long. When it smells really good and has a nice golden color to it its time to eat!

instructions, 1. Slice steak into pieces 1" wide x 3" long x 1/8" thick.  If you are having difficulty getting the steak sliced thin enough place it in the freezer for 30-60 minutes long enough to firm the meat for easy slicing but not long enough to freeze solid. Place sliced meat in a wide dish and sprinkle the 2 tablespoon portion of cornstarch on the steak tossing it until the meat is evenly coated.
2. In a bowl combine the soy sauce brown sugar and the 1 tablespoon portion of soy sauce with a fork.  The cornstarch will settle to the bottom before you've used this solution so leave the fork in the bowl so you can re-incorporate it right before adding to the pan.
3. Heat a large skillet wok or dutch oven over medium-high to high heat.  When the pan is hot add the first tablespoon of vegetable oil swirl to coat the bottom of the pan and immediately add the meat separating the pieces so they form a single layer on the bottom of the pan.  Sear for 3-4 minutes tossing to keep the meat from burning to the bottom of the pan.  When the meat has browned and is cooked to your desired doneness remove from the pan and put on the receiving dish.
4. Add the second tablespoon of vegetable oil swirl to coat the bottom and add the garlic onion and broccoli.  Toss and stir the vegetables constantly until the broccoli has turned from a dull green to a bright healthy happy green.  Remove the vegetables immediately to the receiving dish.
5. Stir the cornstarch-soy-cornstarch mixture until the cornstarch is well-incorporated and add to the pan.  Add the water or beef broth as well and stir (scraping the bottom of the pan to release and dissolve any flavor crystals from your earlier saute efforts)  until the mixture boils and thickens.  Return the cooked vegetables and steak to the pan toss to coat with the sauce and to re-heat and then remove from the pan to the receiving dish.

instructions, 1. Clean and disjoint the duck.  Dip the duck into soy sauce.
2. Over high heat cover the bottom of a heavy skillet with peanut oil to about 1/2 inch deep.
3. When the oil is hot ("sizzling") add the pieces of duck and brown it evenly on both sides.  Remove duck from skillet and drain on paper towels pour out extra fat from pan then replace browned duck into pan.  Lower temperature to medium low.
4. Mix the remainder of the soy sauce with the mashed canned plums reserved plum syrup ginger chopped green onion garlic sweet sauce (if using) and salt.  Pour the mixture over the browned duck pieces in the pan cover and let cook over slow heat for 30 minutes or until the duck is tender.
5. Mix together the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons plum juice and stir until smooth.
6. Remove the duck and thicken the sauce in the pan over low heat by gradually stirring in the cornstarch mixture.  Cook until smooth and clear.
7. Pour the sauce over the duck and serve.
8. Re "Chinese sweet sauce":  the recipe nor book do not give any further info on the "sweet sauce" used but I imagine that such substitutions could be made as an Asian based sweet duck sauce plum sauce or simply a tablespoon of brown sugar for each tablespoon sweet sauce.
9. Note:  in these health conscious days I would probably not use peanut oil to brown the duck but rather olive oil.  If I did use peanut oil I certainly would not use 1/2 cup of it as duck is a meat which is quite full of fat to begin with.  It's up to you how you'd like to brown your duck and what amount of oil to use but I've presented the recipe as originally given in the cookbook.,

instructions, 1. Wash and dry your meat thoroughly. Score the skin in vertical lines about 1 inch apart as they will become the guidelines where to chop the meat once cooked.
2. Mash all the other ingredients together to make a paste. Smear the paste all over the roast working it into the skin and meat. Put the roast in a pan that will let the fat drain through (a wire rack over a baking sheet will do in a pinch) and place in refrigerator covered overnight.
3. When ready to cook preheat your oven to 450 degrees F and when hot enough stick the pan in the over for 30 minutes.
4. After 30 minutes the skin should just be turning brown (if it’s getting too dark turn down the heat sooner). Reduce the heat to 250 degrees F and let it roast for about 8 hours. You’ll know it’s ready when most of the fat has rendered out and the meat has started pulling away from the bone.
5. When it’s ready take it out of the oven transfer it to a different pan (you could do it in the same pan but the fat that’s collected in this pan will smoke and set your smoke alarms off). Put it back into a 450 degree F oven to crisp the skin for 15-20 minutes. The skin should be puffed up crisp and golden brown.
6. Take it out of the oven and let it rest for a bit. You’ll probably want to take the skin off and break it up by hand slicing the slabs of tender pork separately.,

instructions, 1. Spinach: Set a wok or heavy skillet over high heat until very hot.  Add both oils and heat until smoking then add the ginger garlic and red pepper flakes and stir-fry until fragrant 30 seconds.  Add the spinach and stir until slightly wilted but still brightly colored no less than 1 minute.
2. Remove the wok from the heat and toss the spinach with the sherry and soy sauce.  Turn the spinach onto a warmed platter and keep it warm while the eggs cook.
3. Coin-Purse Eggs:  Heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add the oil swirling to coat the bottom of the pan.
4. Crack each egg into a saucer and then add it to the hot oil as for regular fried eggs.  Cook until the bottoms are set about 1 minute.  Then fold each fried egg over into a half-moon shape enclosing the yolk and pressing the edges of the white to seal it closed like a coin purse.  I like my egg yolks pretty well 'set' so I let the egg cook for a while after folding it and then I carefully turn the 'purse' over so the other side can brown a bit.
5. Arrange the hot fried eggs on top of the ginger spinach and serve immediately.
6. Note: This is also a great way to fry eggs for a crowd since they take up less room in the pan and you can fit more inches.,

instructions, 1. Combine the egg white 1 tablespoon soy sauce cornstarch and 1 teaspoon rice wine in a large bowl.  Add the chicken and stir to coat.  Refrigerate for about 30 minutes.
2. In a separate bowl combine the remaining 3 tablespoons soy sauce and 2 tablespoons rice wine with the rice vinegar sugar hoisin and sesame oil and set aside.
3. Heat the oil in a wok over high heat until it's hot and barely smoking.  Add the peanuts and toss them for about 2 minutes or until they begin to brown.  Remove the peanuts from the oil and transfer them to a heatproof plate.  Set aside.
4. Add the chicken to the oil and toss cooking until it is slightly browned on the outside but not cooked all the way through about 2 minutes.  Remove the chicken from the wok and add it to the peanuts.  (There will be some brown bits on the bottom of the wok.  They will help thicken the sauce when it is added to the pan later.  Be careful and don't let them burn or your sauce will taste sharp.).
5. Add the chiles to the wok and cook them until they turn almost black about 1 minute.  Add the garlic green onions and ginger along with the peanuts chicken and sauce.  Toss to incorporate the sauce and heat through.  Serve with rice.
6. Variation:  Sometimes we like to add vegetables to this dish to make it a one-dish meal.  Try adding sliced water chestnuts and green or red bell peppers brocolli or bok choy along with the other vegetables in the dish.  By swapping out the peanuts for cashews the dish becomes cashew chicken.  You can also vary the dish by using thinly sliced pork or beef or whole shrimp.,

9. That way there's plenty of sauce for my rice.
10. (I just don't like dry white rice-if you do feel free to use just the 8 oz of oyster sauce).
11. I don't have a wok so I cook this in my electric frying pan-I've found that if I cover the pan after adding the vegetables and oyster sauce and lower the heat there tends to be more sauce so I can use just the 8 oz.

instructions, 1. First before you do anything get you a really big pot and fill it up with water. I use my big soup stockpot but whatever big pot you have that'll fit the ribs is fine. Heat on burner on medium heat. Next put a bunch of spices and herbs in there I use garlic salt ground pepper thyme rosemary and oregano but whatever u like is fine this is your beef stock.
2. Put ribs in spiced up water. Now let simmer for about 2-3 hours till meat is gray and starting to pull away from the edges of the bones. Take ribs out of pot save liquid for recipes that call for beef stock. Put ribs in 9x13 baking dish or pan don't forget to grease it!
3. Mix all ingredients listed above in a bowl. Taste if not to your liking add a little bit of whatever you think will help it out. I usually end up putting in more honey and hoisin. Now brush some of sauce on both sides of ribs and let sit on and absorb for about 20-30 minute.
4. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Brush more sauce on both sides of ribs. Bake for 15 minute Brush more sauce on. Bake 15 more minute. Sauce on ribs should be brown and crispy looking. Serve with sauce if desired and if enough leftover.

instructions, 1. Smash the unpeeled ginger with the flat of a heavy cleaver so that it will release its juices. Put the ginger in the cup of water stir and set aside. 1 to 2 hours is preferable.
2. Add the sugar and the yeast to the cup of lukewarm water and stir until it dissolves. In the meantime sift the flour into a bowl. When the yeast mixture is foaming add it to the flour and mix vigorously until the mass begins to stick together.
3. Add the oil and when the dough coheres enough place it on a floured counter and knead for 10 minutes until it is smooth. It is very important that the dough be soft. Do not add more flour unless necessary to keep it from sticking to your hands and the kneading surface. Once the dough is kneaded oil the dough ball with peanut oil and place in a covered bowl in a warm place.
4. Separate and blanch the cabbage leaves for 3 minutes in a large pot of boiling water. Remove drain and cool. When it is cool enough to handle roughly chop the cabbage and put in a clean hand towel. Wring out as much of the water as possible then mince.
5. Mix together the pork cabbage the minced ginger minced scallion minced garlic salt and pepper. Mixing thoroughly with a wooden spoon or paddle of a kitchen mixer add the cup of strained ginger water soy wine and sesame oil. Add cornstarch and mix in one direction for several minutes. The filling should be moist almost like batter; add chicken stock if the filling seems stiff or dry.
6. Have the steamer ready before you begin. When the dough has doubled in bulk and you are ready to make the baozi punch down the dough and make several indentations in the dough with your fingers. Sift the baking powder into these holes fold up the dough and pinch the edges together to contain the baking powder.
7. Knead for five minutes or until the baking powder is thoroughly incorporated. Cover the dough ball and let it rest for five or ten minutes. Form the dough into two ropes approximately 1-1/2" in diameter then cut the ropes into sections approximately 1-1/2" long. Roll each segment into a ball place separated on a tray and cover.
8. To make a baozi flatten one of the balls with your hand keeping it as round as possible. Roll the discs into approximately 4” rounds as thin as possible on the edges and 1/8” or so in the center. Roll out several rounds and keep them covered as you begin to fill the baozi (Doing these somewhat ahead once again rests the dough and makes them more manageable).
9. Smear a couple of heaping tablespoons of filling to the dough leaving a border of a half inch or so and begin pleating the very edge with your fingers and thumb overlapping the dough by a quarter inch or so. The pleat should be squeezed firmly and pulled slightly vertically to prevent the top of the finished bun from being too thick.
10. As you pleat rotate the baozi clockwise making sure the filling remains well below the edges of the bun. Complete the process by closing the top with a spiral twist. Place the pleated baozi separated from one another on a steamer tray lined with perforated parchment paper or (napa) cabbage leaves and steam covered for 14 to 15 minutes.
11. It is very important to make one or two sample baozi to test for salt and seasonings. When you've done this you are ready to complete the batch of 20 - 30 baozi.,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 350°F and put a pot of salted water on high heat to cook asparagus.
2. NOTE:  In place of the chicken breasts I skip this step all together and just pick the meat from a whole rotisserie chicken.  (Costco has the absolute best ones anywhere for only $5!)  Saves time and tastes great.  But if you prefer all white meat continue on.
3. Place the chicken breasts on a sheet pan and rub the skin with olive oil.  Sprinkly liberally with salt and pepper.  Roast for 35 to 40 minutes until the chicken is just cooked.  Set aside until cool enough to handle.  (When cooled remove the meat from the bones discard the skin and shred the chicken in large bite-sized pieces).
4. While chicken is roasting blanch the asparagus in the pot of water for three to five minutes until crisp-tender.  Plunge into ice water to stop the cooking.  Drain.
5. Cut the pepper in strips about the size of the asparagus pieces.  Combine the cut chicken asparagus and peppers in a large bowl.
6. Whisk together all of the ingredients for the dressing and pour over the chicken and vegetables.  Add the scallions and sesame seeds and season to taste.  Serve cold or at room temperature.,

instructions, 1. Place the chicken in a mixing bowl and add 2 tablespoons soy bean oil ginger garlic chili flakes and 2 tablespoons soy sauce.  Mix together in circular motion until well mixed.  Marinate in refrigerator for 2-4 hours.
2. Mix together the citrus juices soy and hoisin sauce with a whisk.  Reserve until needed.  Clean the romaine lettuce chopping off the stem peeling each ‘spear’ and running under clean cold water.  Reserve in refrigerator until ready to use.  Chop scallions into rings and reserve chilled.
3. Coat a very hot sauté pan lightly with soy bean oil.  Sauté the chicken (in a thin layer) searing until crispy and golden brown about 2 ½ minutes.  Once chicken is brown toss gently in pan and sear another 2 ½ minutes.  The pan will appear to “burn” but that is the carmelization and where all the flavor comes from.
4. Add ½ of the citrus soy mixture to the sauté pan and coat well.  Let the sauce coat the chicken until it is glazed and thickens on the chicken.  Add more or less depending on how “wet” you want your mixture.  Spoon chicken onto a plate.
5. Wrap the chicken mixture onto the romaine lettuce and top with scallion rings.  Serve and enjoy!,

2. Mix the egg wine and salt and pepper into the pork then gradually add the ginger-water (discarding the crushed pieces) so it is absorbed by the meat to form a fragrant floppy paste.
3. Mix the dipping sauce ingredients in a  small bowl; always add the garlic at the last minute to make the most of it's flavour and fragrance.
4. Fill each dumpling wrapper wth a good teaspoon of filling and seal to make a half-moon shape. Seal with a series of little pinches if you want it to look good and authentic! Make sure dumpling skin is sealed so that the filling can't ooze out. Lay the dumplings out seperately on a lightly floured surface.
5. Heat a large pan of water to a vigorous boil over high heat. Throw in a couple of handfuls of dumplings. Stir once to prevent sticking. When the water has returned to the boil throw in a coffee cupful of cold water. Allow the water to return to the boil and throw in another coffee cupful of cold water. When the water has returned to the boil again the skins should be glossy and the meat should have cooked through.
6. Remove from pan with a slotted spoon drain well and serve hot with dip. Continue cooking the dumplings in batches.
7. FYI - the cold water is added to stop the water from boiling too vigorously and tearin the dumplings apart.,

2. In a small saucepan add remaining orange juice remaining soy sauce sugar chicken broth garlic vinegar and chile flake.  Simmer until liquid is reduced about three-fourths (The recipe calls for 15 minutes but it took A LOT longer for me).
3. While that is reducing peel the orange using a vegetable peeler being sure not to peel off any of the bitter pith.  Slice the strips into narrower strips (about 1/4 wide and no longer than 1 1/2 inches).  Heat one cup of oil in a deep pan or wok until it begins to smoke.  Add in the strips and fry until the edges begin to brown.  Remove IMMEDIATELY to prevent burning.  Store on a paper towel-lined saucer.
4. Mix one tablespoon cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold water.  Add the mixture to the sauce.  Heat until sauce thickens and add in salt.
5. Return the oil to the heat and add 1 cup more oil if needed.  Drain chicken and toss in one cup of cornstarch.  Shake off excess and fry in several batches 4-5 minutes or until cooked through and browned.  Drain chicken on paper towels.
6. In a medium bowl dump chicken and orange peel.  Pour heated sauce over and mix well to cover.  The chicken in sauce may be kept warm in a 200 degree oven to wait for side dishes and rice to be ready if need be.  I've found it improves the coating if this is done.  Serve over rice.

instructions, 1. Immerse egg noodles into boiling water for 30 seconds then remove and set aside.
2. Heat your wok at high heat keep it dry. Add 5 tbsp oil and coat the wok evenly with oil.
3. Fry the noodles for about 2 minutes and keep shaking it back and forth until the noodles turn golden brown.  Flip and repeat.
4. The outer noodles should be golden inner ones are soft.  Remove noodles and arrange in center of a plate.
5. Blanch the vegetables in boiling water (30 seconds).  You can arrange the bok choy in a circle around the noodles if you like.
6. Put some oil and fry minced garlic in the work then add the blanched vegetables and stir fry.  Add the meat ingredients 1 tbsp water cover the wok and steam for 1 - 2 minutes.
7. Add the flavouring ingredients the water with corn starch and fry gently. Add a bit more water if you want more sauce.
8. Pour the veggies and meat over the noodles.
9. Note #1: Char xiu (Honey BBQ pork) is available in Chinatown or a good Chinese grocery store as well as baby boy choy (also known as Shanghai bok choy).
10. Note #2: Ideally you should use a large non-stick wok for frying noodles.  Traditionally Chinese people use a carbon steel wok which is baked in the oven after purchase and then rubbed with oil after washing each time to protect it. It turns black over time and is pretty much non-stick.  You could also use a non-stick pan but non-stick coatings are poisonous and will accumulate in your body.  Non-stick pans should generally be only used with medium or low heat.  If you like them get a professional grade non-stick pan for high heat cooking it feels like ceramic.
11. Note #3: I often add a dash of rice wine (sake) to the meat and vegetables.  It just gives it a little extra flavour and isn't salty like most cooking wines.,

cuisine, Asian >> Chinese and Mongolian >> Chinese, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Wash chicken and dice.  Mix with marinade. Leave in a cool place for at least 30 minutes.  Can be left in the fridge for 2 hours to overnight for deeper favour.
2. Cashew nuts - if you have some nice crispy bought nuts (not honey roasted which will be too sweet for the dish) you can save time by using them instead of preparing the nuts according to steps 2 & 3.  Bring 100 ml of water to the boil.  Add ¼ teaspoon of salt and ½ teaspoon of brown sugar (more favour and also a bit of salt will make the nuts more crispy after deep fried / baking).  Put in cashew nuts and simmer for 30 minutes (so the salt and sugar not only coat the nuts but deposit inside).  Remove and drain.
3. Pre-heat an oven (160C for fan-assistant oven I am not sure the temperature for those without fan may be 170C).  Use an oil brush to grease a baking plate.  Put in a teaspoon of oil (oil/butter though it seems that butter gives a better favour and texture).   Pour in the cashew nuts.  Keep an eye on the nuts once there is no more water bubbles evaporates (takes about 30-45 minutes the nuts would not be crispy with any moisture inside) uses the oil brush to brush all over the nuts.  Bake for another 15 minutes or when the nuts become light brown (the colour will become darker when cool).  Pour over a piece of kitchen paper on a rack to cool.  (It is essential to coat a layer of oil so the nuts can remain crispy much longer after mixing with the sauce.  Some people may prefer deep-fry but too much oil is needed while my husband needs to loss weight. You can double the amount and leave half in an air-tight jar for next meal but I don't do it myself as my husband will finish it quickly.).
4. Heat a non-stick wok with medium heat and add a tablespoon of oil (2 tablespoons of oil if you use a normal wok).  Put in garlic and chilly pepper. Stir fry for a while till you can smell the garlic.
5. Add chicken and stir fry till it is done.  Take out the chicken and put aside.  (Don’t worry if the marinade sticks to a normal wok as the pineapple juice we use later will solve the problem.).
6. Put in green pepper stir fry for 1 – 2 minutess (depending on the hardness of the pepper).
7. Put back the chicken and add the red pepper and stir fry. Pour in seasoning and stir fry until the sauce reduces.
8. Add the pineapple and mix (so the juice of the pineapple will not come out as we have used pineapple juice for seasoning already).
9. Turn off the heat add cashew nuts and mix.  Serve hot.,

cuisine, Asian >> Chinese and Mongolian >> Chinese, 
time, ,

instructions, 1. Now it looks like a lot but it is very easy. Just start each step and honestly it doesn't take any time.
2. Chicken Marinade  --  In a small bowl add the egg white corn starch and soy sauce and whisk well. Add the chicken and toss well to combine.   Just set off to the side on the counter. The chicken will come to room temp as it marinates. I like to let it set 30-45 minutes. This gives you time to prepare everything else.
3. Cashews  --  This only takes a few minutes.  In the same large pan you are going to cook the chicken in (I prefer non stick) add the oil and bring to medium heat. Add the cashews and cook 2-3 minutes until golden brown (stirring often). Once they are done remove to a plate lined with a paper towel to drain. They don't need chopping so they are ready to go. Wipe out the pan as you will be using this to make the chicken.
4. Sauce  --  In a small bowl or even a measuring cup add the chicken broth soy sauce sherry wine sugar red pepper flakes and set to the side. Don't add the scallions yet.
5. Rice  --  Start the rice as the chicken only takes a few minutes to cook. I use a quick cooking rice but feel free to use your favorite. Right at the end of cooking add in the water chestnuts. I make this ahead and just cover and set off to the side.
6. Chicken  --  Time to stir fry! This is quick so make sure you have the sauce nearby the cashews and the rice is done.  Heat that large pan up one more time. Now a wok is great if you have one but not necessary. Add 1 tablespoon each peanut (or whatever you have) and sesame oil (don't leave out the sesame oil (it gives this dish great flavor) and bring to medium/high heat - high heat. Scoop the chicken out of the marinade but use a slotted spoon you don't want to get extra marinade in the pan. You can also strain it in a colander if you want. A slotted spoon works great and much easier. Add it to the hot oil and stir fry on each side until golden brown. It won't take more than 4-5 min tops. They cook very quick and you don't want to over cook them.
7. Right before they are done add in the scallions red pepper strips and cashews. Stir to combine and then add in the sauce. Cook just a minute or two until the sauce is bubbly and thick. The pepper will still be a bit crunchy but tender and the chicken will be tender and done.
8. NOTE: If you like the sauce a bit thicker mix 1 teaspoon cold water with 1 teaspoon corn starch and add to the dish. And cook just a minute  --  this will thicken it up quickly.
9. Serve  --  Just top this wonderful chicken and sauce over the water chestnut rice. As I mentioned I love a Napa cabbage salad with carrots and a sesame dressing for a side but add your favorites. This really may look like a lot but they are all simple steps. Just follow the steps for a quick nice dinner.  ENJOY!
10. Note: Time to make includes marinating.,

instructions, 1. Thoroughly mix together all the marinade ingredients. Put chicken pieces into a large zip-lock baggie. Add 1/2 cup of marinade to the baggie and seal reserving the rest. Toss chicken to thoroughly cover and place baggie into a glass dish and refrigerate for 1 hour tossing again after 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile place beaten eggs in a bowl on the counter. Place the 1 cup of cornstarch into a pie pan. Put the 1 cup oil into a deep heavy bottom skillet. Place remaining un-used marinade into a sauce pan.
3. Remove chicken pieces from the marinade and place on a plate. Discard used marinade.
4. Dip the chicken pieces into the beaten egg then dredge thru the cornstarch. Gently press pieces to be sure they are coated. Place chicken into the fridge for 1 hour to set the coating. EDITED: Place the dredged chicken pieces on a wire rack over a sheet pan to refrigerate I do not recommend leaving the chicken pieces in the pan of cornstarch.
5. After 1 hour remove the chicken from the fridge and heat remaining marinade over medium heat to a boil stirring occasionally. Combine water and the 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and while stirring constantly slowly add enough slurry to the boiling marinade until desired thickness (you may not need it all). Boil 1-2 minutes and remove from heat.
6. Heat oil in a deep heavy bottom skillet over medium high heat. Oil is hot enough when a pinch of cornstarch is sprinkled in and it bubbles. (Sorry I don't use a thermometer).
7. Now working in batches carefully add a small portion of the chicken pieces to the oil and gently roll for 2 minutes (or until chicken is cooked thru). Do not over crowd the pan because it will drop the oil temp and you will have greasy chicken rather than crispy. Remove the pieces using a metal slotted spoon (or a spider) to a paper towel lined plate let oil temp return and begin another batch.
8. When all chicken pieces are done and thoroughly drained toss them into the pan with the heated marinade. Serve immediately over white rice and garnish with sesame seeds and scallions if using.

instructions, 1. To make the sauce combine all the sauce ingredients and stir well. Makes 3 cups.
2. Remove the membrane from the underside of 2 sides pork baby back ribs or your favorite type of ribs (I used a 4 pound pork sparerib slab which came out great).  To remove the membrane place ribs meaty side down on a flat surface. Using your fingernail loosen a little of the membrane along the end of the last rib bone. Then grasp the membrane firmly with a paper towel (so it won't slip from your grip). Holding the ribs down with the other hand pull the membrane away. If it doesn't pull away in one piece dislodge any remaining membrane grip it with a paper towel and pull the membrane away.
3. Place the ribs in a rectangular dish or baking pan.
4. Coat the ribs evenly on both sides with the marinade (reserve some for basting later on I only used half of the sauce for the marinade). Marinate the ribs refrigerated for at least 15 minutes. For more flavor marinate for up to 8 hours.
5. Preheat oven to 350.
6. Use a heavy baking sheet with shallow sides when oven roasting ribs. Line the baking sheet with heavy duty aluminum foil and position a wire rack on top. Spray the wire rack liberally on both side with vegetable oil cooking spray (it will make clean up so much easier even if its a nonstick).
7. Place a small pan (such as a bread tin or small Pyrex dish) filled with 2 inches of hot tap water in the bottom of the oven to keep the ribs from drying out as they roast.
8. Lay the ribs on the wire rack meaty side up. Slide the pan holding the wire rack onto the center oven rack.
9. To prevent ribs from steaming cook only one baking pan of ribs per oven.
10. Always roast the ribs meaty side up and never turn the ribs over. Otherwise the sauce glazing the meaty side of the ribs will be dislodged. Baste the meaty side of the ribs with reserved marinade 1 or 2 times during roasting if desired.
11. Cook the ribs until the meat begins to shrink away from the ends of the bones about 75 to 90 minutes.
12. Remove the ribs for the oven. Wait five minutes before cutting each rib into 2 pieces in half or into individual ribs.,
