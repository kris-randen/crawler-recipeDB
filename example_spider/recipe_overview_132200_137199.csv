instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 350°.  Toast the hazelnuts and almonds on a rimmed baking sheet until fragrant and lightly colored inside about 15 minutes.  Let cool then chop coarsely.  Reduce oven temp to 300°.
2. Butter the bottom and sides of an 8-in tart pan with a removable bottom.
3. In a large bowl stir together the flour cocoa fennel seed cinnamon cloves and orange zest.  Add the nuts and figs and stir to coat.
4. In a small saucepan heat the sugar and honey over low heat stirring until the sugar dissolves.  Raise the heat to medium and cook without stirring until the mixture reaches 245° on a candy thermometer 2-3 minutes.  Immediately pour over the nut mixture.  Working quickly stir until the dry ingredients are coated; the mixture will be stiff.  Transfer to the prepared pan spreading it evenly with a wooden spoon dipped in cold water.  Bake for 40 minutes.  The mixture will still be tacky to the touch.  Cool the panforte completely on a rack then remove from the pan.  Slice into 16 thin wedges.

instructions, 1. in a non-aluminum perfectly clean pot bring the milk to 55f. dissolve the citric acid in 1/2 cup water. if using buttermilk then omit the water and you may want it a bit warmer and let it sit an hour with the buttermilk culture to help it ripen better then again that might be why some people let the drained curds ripen overnight. i say experiment. if using citric acid you don't need to let it ripen go straight to the next step.
2. bring the milk to 87-90f and gently stir in the rennet dissolved in the 1/4 cup water. cover the pot remove from heat and let sit undisturbed for 5-10 min or until it looks like custard and you can see a clear separation between the curds and whey. if you poke a clean finger into it it should separate cleanly hence being called a "clean break".
3. with a long knife cut the curd into 1/2 inch cubes by making a grid across your pot of custard and then running the knife diagonally to break up horizontally as much as possible without the curds dissolving. be gentle with your curds they're not cheese yet!
4. stirring gently bring the curds and whey to between 97 and 105f (instructions vary i figure around 100 is good enough).
5. remove from heat and continue stirring gently (just enough to keep the curds from matting together) for 2-5 minute.
6. some instructions say to drain the whey (save to make ricotta!) through several layers of cheesecloth lining a strainer and let ripen at room temp overnight to develop flavors and acids. others say to use a slotted spoon to lift the curds out of the whey and proceed directly to the stretching stage:
7. in the stretching stage we will slightly melt the curds and then stretch them to develop the texture. you can do this by microwaving the curds for 1 min kneading with spoons and pressing out as much whey as you can zap again for 30 seconds and kneed again then 15 seconds until your curds are stretchy and resemble melty mozza. you're using spoons because it has to get to 145f to stretch which is way too hot to touch. if you're more of a traditionalist or don't have a microwave you can heat water to just under boiling and lower some curds into the hot water (with your handy slotted spoon) for a few seconds to a min until it's getting a bit melty then take out and knead (maybe with spoons or wearing thick rubber gloves) and repeat until it looks like mozza (smooth and shiny). either way work in manageable sections and form your cheese into balls of a size that please you.
8. now make some cold brine and drop your cheese balls in it. this is just salt dissolved in water. the cold part helps solidify the cheese and makes the texture consistent throughout. the salt part adds flavor. the saltier your brine and the longer you soak it the saltier it will be. i'm going to start with 1/2 cup of salt to 2 cups of water and taste after 15 min of soaking.
9. this cheese is best eaten fresh but it can also be frozen. if you're keeping it in the fridge then leave it in water or brine to keep it from drying out. try with fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden! add a little pepper and oil and vinegar perhaps? do you feel like a brave homesteader yet? don't forget to make ricotta with your whey! i'll post that recipe soon.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. In larger sized mixing bowl mix together milk and eggs.
3. Break bread in pieces and soak in milk-egg mixture until bread falls apart and it becomes a fairly well mixed consistency.
4. Add in seasoning packets and all optional seasoning. Stir until well incorporated.
5. Take off all rings and jewelry and add ground meat to mixture. Use your hands to mix until all ingredients are well blended.
6. Mix in parmesan cheese.
7. Allow mixture to rest for about 15 minutes. This gives it a chance to firm up so it will be easier to work with.
8. Form into balls that are between the size of a walnut and an apricot they will be soft so be gentle.
9. Place on cookie sheets and try to space out enough that they don’t touch once on the pan. I do 20 to 30 per pan depending on how much of a hurry I am inches.
10. Bake at 400 for 25-30 minutes or until cooked through. If I feel vigilant I broil them for about 5 minutes right at the end. If you skip that step they are still tasty.
11. Pull out of oven and cool on the pan or drain on paper towels if you so desire.
12. Eat them as appetizers or add to your favorite pasta dish.
13. NOTE: If this is a larger batch than you plan to eat you can freeze extras for later use. One other option is to roll out as many as you want and use the rest of the mixture to make meat loaf. Put meat mixture in a loaf pan and bake it at 350 for an hour. Drain excess fat off when you pull pan out of the oven and then allow to cool completely in the pans before slicing.,

2. Line a 15x10x1-inch baking pan with foil (heavy-duty is best); spray foil with non-stick spray.
3. Beat egg in a large bowl mix in all remaining ingredients (hands work best; I wear latex gloves).
4. Shape the beef mixture into an 8-inch square on the foil-lined pan and cut into 36 squares; do not separate squares.
5. (I recommend using a pizza wheel or metal dough scraper to cut the squares - you are less likely to cut through the foil and mar the pan.).
6. Bake at 425 F for 20 to 25 minutes or until meatballs are thoroughly cooked and no longer pink in center.
7. Cut apart meatballs (again I prefer to use a pizza wheel or metal dough scraper).
8. Use as needed in any recipe calling for meatballs.
9. Freezing Tip: Freeze meatballs individually first then separate into recipe-sized portions and place in freezer containers or freezer bags; Use within 2 months.,

instructions, 1. First clean the mussels pulling off any excess beard you may find sticking out of their shells.
2. Pour the white wine and the water into a large pan and bring to the boil. Add the mussels discarding any that are open and bring back to the boil. Place a lid on and steam until they are open. Drain the mussels and discard any that are still closed. Leave to cool long enough for you to be able to handle them.
3. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) gas mark 6.
4. Mix together the breadcrumbs parsley chilli and garlic. Season with salt and pepper – be careful with the salt as the mussels will already have a salinity to them.

2. Spray your baking sheet with oil  and bake at 350 F for 40 minutes. If you are planning on serving them with Marinara Sauce throw the meatballs in the pot to simmer for a while. Doing this will add a yummy rich flavor to the sauce. Also do not be afraid to leave them in there for a while too. Grandma used to leave everything to simmer all day before serving dinner. The result was a delicious smelling house as well as an infusion of meaty wonderfulness in the marinara sauce and super delicious tender meatballs! Garnish your homemade meatballs with some more grated cheese and a little fresh parsley for color and enjoy.,

instructions, 1. For the tomatoes:  In a shallow bowl mix the tomatoes green onions parsley basil garlic olive oil and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the bowl and let the tomatoes marinate at room temperature for at least 1 hour but preferably 3 to 4 hours. Stir them occasionally so that all the tomatoes are marinated. If the tomatoes are very ripe and marinate long enough they will crack and burst allowing their juices to mix deliciously with the marinade.
2. For the garlic bread:  Combine the olive oil and garlic and let the mixture stand for 10 minute so the flavors blend. Meanwhile heat the broiler. Brush one side of each piece of bread with the garlic and olive oil and broil them oiled side up until lightly browned. Put a slice of provolone and a generous sprinkling of asaigo on the toasted side of each slice saving a little Parmesan for garnish. Set the bread aside until you're ready to serve the tomatoes.
3. Just before serving heat up the broiler again. Toast the bread under the broiler until the cheese is bubbly.
4. To serve put a piece of the bread in a shallow soup bowl. Spoon about 3/4 cup of the tomatoes and marinade on or around the edges of the bread. Garnish with more asaigo.,

cuisine, European >> Italian >> Italian, 
time, ,

instructions, 1. You will want to start to let your dough rise.To keep this simple and easy get frozen bread dough all ready to go just needs to rise. you will have to plan ahead for this recipe to allow the bread dough to rise for about 4-5 hours.
2. To start the dough rising. You remove the frozen dough and place it on a greased cookie sheet and cover with a kitchen towel. I like to spray the cookie sheet and towel with oil first so it won't stick later. Try to find a warm moist place to let the dough rise. In the winter this can be hard to find. So if all you have is a cold dry place you can do the following to get a warm moist place. In this case you will put you frozen bread dough on a greased microwavable platter and cover with kitchen towel. Boil a cup of water in the microwave then quickly remove the cup of water and put in your dough. Let it sit in there for about 4-5 hours. No peeking just let it sit.
3. After the dough has risen you will now need to work the dough into long rectangular pieces to make your loaves. Throw some flour on your "clean" counter. Then work the dough with your hands. You don't need to knead the dough you just want to start spreading it out with you hands. You may have to sprinkle a little bit of flour on the dough while you are working with it. This is OK but not too much. You will have to work with it a bit push pull spread smack whatever it takes. You will get to a point when you will need to switch to a rolling pin to finish off the process.
4. Be careful not to spread the dough to thin you need some thickness to handle the meat filling. I usually end up cutting a regular sized frozen bread loaf in half to make two sausage bread loaves.After the dough has been prepared and is ready for filling you will now need to make the Italian sausage and pepper filling.
5. First take a the two slices of bacon and cut them up into small bits with some scissors. About 1/4" peices if you can. Fry up the bacon in the pan until you get a lot of nice bacon grease. Now add the ground Italian sausage and continue to fry. (If you can't find ground Italian sausage then you can get regular linked Italian sausage and remove the guts from the skin and use that.) Cut up 2-3 medium sized green peppers and throw them in with your sausage half-way through browning. Brown until the sausage gets a nice dark brown look and the peppers are well sauteed into the mix. When done drain out all the grease then place the meat and peppers onto a plate that has several paper towels on it to further drain the meat. Let this sit long enough to cool.
6. This would be a good time to preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.After the meat and pepper filling has cooled you will now put this on top of the dough. Spread out the filling onto the dough while leaving enough room on the sides to wrap the dough around the filling.
7. Make sure you seal all the side up well so the meat is well sealed. Then with a fork poke a bunch of holes on the top of the loaf to allow for steam venting during bakingBeat a couple of eggs into a bowl and use this as a glaze Brush a "little bit" of egg over the loaves. This will help you get a nice golden brown look to the bread. Now place the loaves in your preheated oven and cook for 40 - 50 minutes.When done baking let the loaves cool on a cookie cooling rack.
8. For presentation I like to slice up the loaves into small pieces and then place them on a platter like you see below. This way they are nice and easy to grab and eat. This makes a great appetizer!,

3. Spoon a light coating of olive oil and very lightly salt.  Finish with healthy drizzle of balsamic glaze.
4. Important use fresh mozzarella in brine sold either at the deli counter or in vacuum sealed packages.  Fresh mozzarella is not the same as "Buffalo Mozzarella".  True Italian Buffalo Mozzarella is traditionally made from buffalo milk.  It is sold as "Mozzarella di Bufala Campana" and is certified and protected.  It is also welcomed in this salad.,

Remove from heat and remove asparagus with a slotted spoon; drain on several thicknesses of paper toweling until ready to serve. Remember that the asparagus will continue to cook from their own heat as they stand and cool so if you like very firm asparagus time them accordingly. Divide cooked asparagus among 4 individual serving plates. Sprinkle with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
2. In a medium-size frying pan over medium heat heat the butter until just hot enough to sizzle a drop of water. Break and slip eggs into the pan; reduce heat to low and cook approximately 2 to 3 minutes or until whites are set but yolks are still runny. With a spatula remove the eggs to the plates you will serve them on and place on top of the asparagus (be careful not to break the yolks). The eggs should be hot enough to slightly melt the grated parmesan cheese
3. If the butter hasn’t already begun to brown increase the heat under the frying pan and cook butter until lightly browned. Pour the browned butter over the top of the eggs. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Serve immediately.,

instructions, 1. Pick the basil leaves off the stems.
2. Rinse off the pistachios and let them dry. If you don't get the excess sali off the end product will be too salty. You can always add more salt at the end if needed.
3. Put the basil leaves in your food processor work bowl with the cheese and the nuts.
4. Pulse it 5 or 6 times to start breaking up the leaves.
5. Switch it to run and slowly start drizzling in the oil. You may need more or less. I just eyeballed it until it got to the consistancy I like.
6. At this point taste it. If you think it needs salt add a small pinch at a time. I over salted the first batch because I forgot the pistachios were so salty.,

3. Pour in the white wine and boil rapidly until most of the liquid is gone.
4. Add the rice and stir to coat with the onion and wine.
5. One ladle at a time add the stock and simmer until almost completely absorbed (keep an eye on this - it'll stick to the bottom of your pan like nobody's business!).
6. Continue until the rice has been cooking for ~20 minutes and it is soft and creamy but still has a little bit of bite to it.
7. Season generously (if you can't find fresh Basil then at this point stir in a healthy portion of dried Basil or Mixed Herbs) and add the parmesan.
8. Stir in the beaten egg (If you're making a big batch and planning to eat some then obviously do this after you've taken out tonight's meal!)
9. Allow to cool completely (ideally overnight - but half an hour in the fridge should do it. It's just easier to handle when completely cold).
10. Spoon 1tbsp of the risotto into the palm of your hand.
11. Place a basil leaf and a piece of mozzarella - about half an inch across - on top of the rice.

instructions, 1. Mix filling ingredients and refrigerate until you need to fill your pasta.
2. Roll your pasta dough into two long strips as thin as possible.  Make sure you flour your board well.
3. With a small cookie scoop make twenty mounds of filling on one strip (or twenty four depending on your ravioli cutter size - I get 22 about 2 1/2 inches around with my cutter.  You can see the pictures.
4. Put the second strip of pasta on top of the filled pasta (I fill half of one strip and fold the other half on top of it to save space on my counter - I think it's easier to do two strips but I have a short space to work in).
5. Starting from the center of the pasta strip press as much air as you can out of the filling towards the end  and sides of the dough.  Cut the ravioli with a well floured 2 1/2" cutter making sure to press hard so you seal the edges.  If you want you can egg wash the pasta strips to make sure they stick.  I don't but some people do.
6. Let them dry on a well-floured board for at least 30 minutes.  In a huge skillet bring well-salted water to the boil and add about a tablespoon of oil to it to prevent boil-overs.
7. Put the ravioli in the water and reduce the heat so it barely boils or you may explode the ravioli.  Cook until desired tenderness - my pasta is thin and the ravioli cook in 7 minutes.  Use a wire or slotted spoon to remove the ravioli rather than pouring them into a colander since this will break them. They are very delicate.
8. Sauce with Recipe #rz.279041 and serve Garnish with basil.  Usually 5 for a main dish and 2 or three for a starter.  If you want baked ravioli just put sauce in your casserole then the cooked ravioli sauce the tops a little add mozzarella shreds and bake them until the mozzarella is all melty and lovely. Top with a little Parmesan and some fresh chopped basil or parsley and serve.
9. Take your deformed ravioli and cook to get your time down pat.  Also if you have air in the ravioli it will probably explode so poke a toothpick in the top center so the air has an escape route.
10. OR you can freeze your ravioli in a single layer before cooking.  Just put them on a tray that is well floured and freeze them hard.  Store in a flat container - not a freezer bag.  Make sure you cover them tightly.  Use within a month or so.,

2. Sandwich bread is best for the recipe as the result is lighter. It is even tastier if very finely cut slices of Gruyèr cheese are laid on top of the fresly fried bread so that they gently melt into it. Golden fried bread can also be used to great effect in soups. Cut the slices into cubes and place in the soup dishes before serving clear beef broth a table.

3. Shape mixture into balls slightly smaller than a baseball but bigger than a golf ball and then set them aside.  UPDATE:  I started using a 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop the mixture and it makes the meatballs just the right size.
4. Pour half of the sauce in a grill (oven) safe stock pot or roasting pan that will be large enough to hold all the meatballs.  Place the pot/pan on the grill away from the direct heat when the fire is ready.
5. When the grill is ready place the meatballs directly over the heat and sear on both the top and bottom for 3-5 minutes per side.
6. When you are done searing the meatballs place them away from the direct heat (I have a top rack on my grill and place them here).
7. Let them cook for 5-8 more minutes or until the meatballs are firm but not fully cooked and then place all the meatballs in the pot/pan and place that directly over the heat source.
8. Cook for an additional 8-10 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 155-160 degrees F (you could also cut a meatball in half to make sure that the meat is no longer pink in the middle).,

You can buy one for about $5.00 at a home brew supply store which almost every community has -- otherwise buy one off ebay or from some hardware stores.  They are called 'Ale Pales" misspelling intentional. The air lock costs less then a dollar and is a simple piece of plastic that sticks through a hole on the bucket lid.  Easy stuff a 6 year old could make this recipe.
2. Mix all ingredients with long spoon or other chosen tool.
3. Add cucumbers.
4. Weigh down so that all cucumbers are below the liquid.  I use a overturned ceramic bowl that fits the bucket well.  others use large gallon Zip- Lock bags filled with water.  You are a smart person find something that keeps the pickles under the liquid. Something non-reactive though no copper or brass --
5. Cap bucket and fill airlock with some tap water. This keeps bad stuff out but lets the bucket breathe. Let the bucket sit for 10 days in a cool dark corner of your house.  if you live in a very hot place consider using the basement.
6. After ten days open container skim off the scum ( the scum is a perfectly safe yeast extract if you wanted to you could just stir it in but it is ugly so remove it) recover bucket and let sit for 5 more days in the cool dark place in your house.
7. Open again get rid of scum and/or soft pickles. If you can squeeze and easily crush the pickle toss it.  I lose about ten each time its just part of the game. Now get ready to jar.
8. Take out pickles a few at a time slice into half or fourths and fit into a jar. You will need about twenty jars. If you want you can jar them whole but most people don't like eating whole pickles.
9. Fill said bottles to very very top with brine and hand tighten lid.
10. Put them in a fridge and they will keep for a very long time as long as they stay in the fridge.
11. Once you open a jar to begin consumption they will last about 5 days. It is important to not let the yeast extract that will settle at the bottom of the jar bother you.  Simply shake the jar like a bottle of juice each time you take out a pickle.  The liquid should and will be cloudy.
12. When they turn soft or the skin easily peels off pickle it is time to throw them away. This will not happen until you open the jar.  So remember to tell the happy people that you share these pickles with to consume within 5 days.,

3. Sprinkle half the Italian seasoning and half the garlic slivers over the chicken.
4. Put the other half of the seasonings into the cavity.
5. Put half the liquids into the cavity and pour half over the chicken. You want to wash some but not all of the seasonings into the pan.
6. Cover and roast at 300 for 2-3 hours or at 250 for 3 hours. You can remove the lid for the last half hour or so to get better browning.
7. The meat will be very tender -- falling off the bones (a stew hen may have more integrity depending on how tough it started before you tenderized it with the moist heat).
8. Suggestion -- Serve over pasta and pass parmesan at the table.
9. Suggestion -- Complete the meal with grilled zuccini breaded and fried zuccini or flat Italian beans that have been steamed or microwaved and some crusty Italian bread.,

instructions, 1. Follow the directions on the peas for reconstituting them.
2. I generally do the"quick" method of boiling water (but frankly they never get soft enough and well that's basically part of this recipe's charm).
3. After the peas have softened drain them and combine with the sauerkraut and onion in a stock pot over medium heat.
4. Stir occasionally so the sauerkraut and onions don't stick or burn.
5. The sauerkraut will give off more liquid as it heats which will help to cook the onions and get the peas a bit softer.
6. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
7. Add in the butter and just enough flour to slightly thicken the mixture.
8. Serve HOT& it's actually better the second day.,

2. Mince garlic.
3. Saute garlic and onion in 2 T butter over medium heat until onions are caramelized.  Remove from heat and let cool to near room temperature.
4. Beat 2 eggs thoroughly with 2 T marjoram 1 T thyme/sage salt and pepper.
5. In bowl add ground beef pork (or veal) rice onion garlic and eggs.
6. Mix thoroughly with your hands.
7. Cover and let rest in the fridge.  (You can let it sit overnight it will just let the flavors permeate more.).
8. Core cabbage.
9. Blanche cabbage leaves in boiling water peeling them off as they become limp. (Alternatively after coring the cabbage you can put it in the freezer and after it's frozen let it thaw and the leaves will be limp--you can just pull them off.  **If you choose to freeze freeze the cabbage the night before and keep in mind it will take a few hours for it to thaw**).
10. Once you've separated all the leaves take a paring knife and cut off any thick stems preventing the limp leaf from bending/rolling.
11. Put about 2 T of meat filling in the center of each leaf.  Fold the sides of the leaf in and roll it up into a little package.  Put each golabki seam-down into a casserole dish.  (At this point if you like you can freeze them and thaw them later.  Once thawed continue with the recipe steps below.).
12. Once you've used up all the cabbage leaves or meat filling take your cans of tomatoes and pour them over the golabki.
13. Sprinkle the remaining teaspoons of marjoram into the tomato sauce before pouring it over the golabki and tomatoes.
14. Bake covered at 350 for 2 hours.,

time, ,

instructions, 1. Start a 4-6 quart pot of water to boil. Using lots of water for the dumplings to swim in is very important. When it starts to boil salt the water liberally. Keep covered and on a simmer while mixing the potatoes so it's ready to boil when you are ready to make the dumplings.
2. Peel then grate potatoes with a grating blade (smallest holes) in a food processor. Remove any chunks. Strain potatoes in a strainer (not a colander) until water from potatoes is removed. Press on the potatoes to remove as much water as possible. The more water left in the potatoes the more flour you'll need and you'll have less potato taste in the end.
3. Put potatoes in a large bowl and add salt. Mix with a rubber spatula or large spoon.
4. Lightly mix eggs in a cup with a fork and add to potatoes. Mix.
5. Add flour to potatoes starting with 1 cup. Mix and continue to add flour until the potatoes are the consistency between pancake batter and bread dough. You shouldn't be able to pour it but you shouldn't be able to knead it either. If you wish taste potato mixture to check salt.
6. Cut bacon into 1/2-1 inch chunks. Fry in a high-sided frying pan on medium heat until limp not crunchy. Set aside off heat or on lowest heat.
7. Bring water back to boil. The water shouldn't be a full rolling boil. It will cause the dumplings to fall apart. Keep the water at just a gentle boil.
8. Test one dumpling by using a teaspoon and drop in a dollop of potato mixture (about the size of a large cherry). It will plump up. See if the dumpling holds together. It should sink to the bottom of the pot and when cooked fully it will float. If it falls apart (water starts to fill with bits of potato mixture) add more flour about 1/4 cup at a time. Test again until it holds together.
9. The water will become cloudy and little bits of potato will appear over the course of boiling the dumplings. This is normal. The dumplings will look shaggy not round or perfect. You can stir them gently during cooking to keep them from sticking together.
10. As the dumplings float take them out with a slotted spoon or strainer and put directly in the bacon pan. Mix all the dumplings in the bacon pan until coated with bacon grease. Taste and add salt as needed. Serve.
11. Save a cup of potato water and add as needed to dumplings when reheating the next day.,

instructions, 1. In a medium size bowl combine potatoes flour salt and egg yolk.  Work together until a dough forms.  Flour a countertop with additional flour and begin to knead the dough for about two minutes. You do not want the dough to be too sticky so add more flour as kneaded (ha get it?).
2. Let dough sit while you prepare the filling. In a medium bowl stir together all the ingredient for the filling until combined.
3. Roll pierogie dough out and cut out small circles about 2 1/2 inches in diameter and 1/6 of an inch thick. I know these measurements sound specific but don't worry if it isn't exact. You just want the dough to be somewhat thin but not paper thin and want a wide enough circle so you can stuff the pierogie.
4. Place slightly less than a tablespoon worth of filling into each dough circle.  Brush the edges of the dough with egg white and fold one side over top of the other and seal. Make sure the seal is tight. Do this until you have used all the filling.
5. Bring 4 cups of salted water to boil.  Once water is boiling drop pierogies into the water. They will float to the top when they are ready to be pan fried.  Let them take their time.
6. In a large skillet melt butter and add onions. Once pierogies are floating transfer them from the water to the skillet. Pan fry about 2 minutes per side. I let mine get pretty brown but you can opt to cook them for less time. Again pierogie maker's choice!
7. Once done remove pierogies from skillet.  Serve with chopped onion and sour cream.,

7. Using a sharp knife cut the dough into 1 1/2 inch wide strips. Then cut the other way in a diagonal to make pieces of dough that are about 1 1/2 X 4 inches.
8. Next use your knife to cut a slit in the center of each piece.
9. To form the wing shape take one pointy end and poke it through the slit. Very gently pull the end through the slit to form a bow shaped cookie.

2. Set it on a plate and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm until you're ready to eat.
3. Add the milk and the pepper to the kielbasa broth. Then make up a slurry of 1/4" cup cornstarch and 1/2 cup water to thicken. You must bring the soup back to a boil for the cornstarch to work so do it then if it's not thick enough make up another slurry adding a little at a time until the soup is thick and creamy.
4. Serve it in a large bowl so that you can place on piece of each of the items from the table in it. This was done by my Grandmother and we've continued to eat the soup this way.,

instructions, 1. Cut the core from the cabbage. Place the cabbage in a large pot of boiling water. Remove outer leaves as they become soft. (Alternatively you can remove the core from the cabbage and freeze the cabbage overnight let it thaw and remove the now soft leaves…but who plans that far ahead?).
2. In a large bowl thoroughly mix together: the beef pork ½ of the onion ½ the garlic rice thyme salt and pepper.  Roll a few tablespoons of this mixture in each of the softened cabbage leaves.  Place rolls seam side down in a large deep baking dish. (Make sure you don’t use a shallow dish or it will overflow!).
3. In a large saucepan sauté onions and garlic in olive oil until aromatic.  Add all of the canned tomato stuff and hot sauce.  Add 2 tablespoons (okay -- this amount is a guess…use your best judgement) thyme and some salt and pepper.  Bring sauce to a gentle boil stirring occasionally.  Allow to simmer.
4. Spread the sauerkraut over the cabbage rolls in an even layer.  I don’t recommend adding all of the liquid in the kraut but some of it is okay.  Pour the sauce over the sauerkraut and bake in a 350 degree oven forever or for a few hours whatever comes first. Make sure they don’t dry out. If they start to add a can of tomato sauce over the top and reduce heat.,

instructions, 1. FOR THE FILLING: Combine all ingredients in medium bowl. Set aside 1 tablespoon filling.
2. FOR THE DOUGH: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. When oven reaches 200 degrees turn it off. Grease large bowl. Whisk milk egg yolks and vanilla together in 1-cup liquid measuring cup.
3. Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook mix flour sugar yeast and salt on low speed until combined. Slowly add milk mixture and mix until dough comes together about 3 minutes. Increase speed to medium-low and add butter 1 piece at a time until incorporated about 1 minute. Continue to mix until dough is smooth and comes away from sides of bowl 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer dough to prepared bowl cover with plastic wrap and place in turned-off oven until dough has risen slightly about 1 hour. Place in refrigerator until dough is firm and has doubled in size at least 1 hour.
4. Line 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pan with parchment paper allowing excess to hang over edges. Punch down dough on lightly floured counter. Roll out dough to 20 by 14-inch rectangle. Spread all but 1 tablespoon reserved filling over dough leaving ½-inch border around edges. Working from short side roll dough into cylinder and pinch along seam to seal. Position cylinder seam side up and roll back and forth until stretched to 18-inch length. Spread reserved filling over top of cylinder. Fold cylinder on top of itself and pinch ends to seal. Gently twist double cylinder twice to form double figure eight. Place shaped dough seam side down in prepared pan cover loosely with plastic and let rise in turned-off oven until doubled in size about 1 hour.
5. Lightly beat whole egg in bowl. Remove loaf from oven and discard plastic. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Brush loaf with beaten egg. Bake until deep golden brown and loaf registers 190 degrees about 45 minutes. Let cool in pan on wire rack for 20 minutes. Remove loaf from pan and cool completely about 2 hours. Serve.
6. TO MAKE AHEAD: Instead of letting dough rise in step 4 cover shaped loaf with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Let dough sit at room temperature for 1 hour before baking.
7. **Once you’ve added the butter in step 3 if the dough is still sticking to the sides of the bowl after five minutes of mixing add 2 to 4 tablespoons of extra flour. The test kitchen’s favorite loaf pan measures 8½ by 4½ inches; if you use a standard 9 by 5-inch loaf pan start checking the babka for doneness after 40 minutes.,

3. Place head of cabbage in a pot of boiling water. Be very careful taking the head out to take a few leaves off at a time and replacing it back into the water. I use a large serving fork to stab it in the core area.
4. Put your ground beef in a large bowl. Add 2 cups cooked rice the minced onion 1 cup of water salt pepper and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder or double if you like that flavor. Mix with hands. Take a hefty size tablespoon full and place on stem end of a cabbage leaf. Bring each side of leaf over into middle and roll. Place roll in baking dish (sprayed with PAM) with the seam side down. Repeat until all meat is used.
5. Pour your tomato juice into a bowl. Add the mushroom soup and whisk these together until smooth. Pour over top of rolls. An added delicious treat is to place sliced kielbasa around the cabbage rolls if you wish. Cover with foil and bake about 1 1/2 hours on 350 degrees.

instructions, 1. Prepare potatoes as you would for mashed potatoes until tender and then drain and keep in the pot.
2. At the same time the potatoes are cooking sauté the onions in the entire pound of margarine.
3. When the onions are done using a slotted spoon scoop out about 3/4 of the onions and put into the pot of potatoes.
4. You will be saving almost all the margarine for the end of the recipe with a little bit of the onions.
5. Also add the shredded cheddar cheese to the potatoes.
6. Then using an electric mixer mash the potato mixture until as smooth as possible.
7. It will be lumpy somewhat with the onions in it.
8. At that time add garlic and salt and pepper to your own taste and mix until done.
9. Set aside to cool while you work on the dough.
10. In a large bowl put about 6 cups of flour in making a well in the middle.
11. In the well put in one teaspoons.
12. Salt both eggs (already slightly beaten) and about one cup of water.
13. Mix well with a strong wooden spoon and add water or flour as needed until the dough is formed.
14. When it's almost ready it will no longer stick to the sides of the bowl.
15. Place the dough on a well-floured surface and knead it until it is smooth and shiny.
16. Use flour as needed but not too stiff.
17. Set aside and let the dough rest.
18. Fill a large 6-8 quart pot with water add a teaspoon of salt and bring the water to rolling boil.
19. The process of the making the pyrohis is easy but it is a long one.
20. Extra hands are always welcome in making this delicious meal.
21. On one side of your table place a clean sheet folded to fit your space and flour this very well.
22. It will be the place you will set your pirohis between the making and actual boiling of them.
23. If your surface is not floured they will stick and fall apart in the boiling process.
24. Cut off about 1/3 of the dough and rolls with a rolling pin until thin (not too thin).
25. Cut circles with a round biscuit cutter or a glass.
26. Keep hands floured so the dough doesn't stick to them and stretch out dough a little a a time until there is enough space to put the potato mixture inches.
27. With a teaspoon fill the center of the dough with the potato mixture and fold the dough over and pinch the edges tight with floured fingers to form a crescent.
28. Put the completed pirohi on your well-floured sheet and continue the process until all your pirohi are done.
29. If the water is boiling too much turn down until you are ready to boil them.
30. Now the actual cooking starts.
31. Put about a dozen of the pirohi in the boiling water and stir once easily to loosen them.
32. Now let them boil until they float to the top of the pot and let them boil for another minute or so.
33. Remove them one at a time with a large slotted spoon and put them into a colander to drain.
34. Use a large cake pan or a roaster pan and drizzle the bottom with the extra onion margarine.
35. Place the drained pirohi in the pan and cover them with a little margarine mixture and shake the pan back and forth to keep the pirohis from sticking to each other.
36. Repeat the process until all the pirohi are done.
37. Keep the large pan or roaster in the oven only on warm and cover them with foil or lid to keep them from drying out.
38. Any extra dough: Roll out thin on the floured surface and cut into strips boil drain and use for buttered noodles or holushki (sautéed cabbage and noodles.) I guarantee-- if you take the time to make these babies-- your family will LOVE them-- and you will have tasted two of the best of the Ukrainian cuisine around!

7. Cover with lid or foil and bake at 350 degrees for about 1 hour or until a skewer comes out clean. This will or should stay moist and soft not dry.
8. You may also use a crockpot on low for 4-6 hours.  Your crockpot liner works well in the oven too.
9. While it is cooking make the Dutch Honey (recipe #71143). Just in case you have a sweet tooth in the house.
10. Serve cool cold warm or hot.  Trust me it is good in all forms.,

2. For Pastry Crust.
3. Whisk together the flour and salt.
4. Cut butter into pats and add to flour mixture.
5. Using a pastry blender or your fingers cut the butter into the flour mixture until the mixture is mealy with pea-sized lumps.
6. Add the ice water and knead the dough slightly to bring it together and form a ball.
7. Chill dough for 30 minutes.
8. _____________________________________________.
9. For Filling.
10. Combine the almond paste and sugar (it will be very stiff so you will have to mix it with your fingers); add the egg and mix until well-combined.
11. _____________________________________________.
12. To Make Tarts.
13. Pull off enough dough to make a 1/2 to 3/4-inch ball.
14. Place ball of dough into cup of non-stick or lightly greased muffin/tart pan (with 1 to 1 1/2-inch sized cups).
15. Using a tart shaper (dipped in flour to prevent sticking) press into center of ball flattening the bottom and forcing dough up sides of muffin cup. If you don't have a tart shaper use your thumb or other rounded tool instead.
16. Be careful not to make dough too thin on bottom. Fill in any accidental thin spots with small pieces of dough pressed into place.
17. Repeat for remaining muffin cups.
18. Return any remaining dough to refrigerator until ready to make next batch to keep it from getting to soft.
19. Place almond filling in pastry bag or plastic bag with a hole cut in one corner and pipe filling into pastry cups filling them up about 3/4 of the way full (filling with puff up some during baking).
20. Bake 15-20 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.
21. Let cool in pan before removing tarts.

instructions, 1. I try to use a ratio of two parts solid to one part liquid but for your first batch use more liquid. It just takes longer and the liquid must boil off before it will reach the proper temperature so err on the side of too much liquid at first.
2. In a pan put 1/2 cup of clear corn syrup one cup of sugar and put 1/2 cup of water on top of the sugar and make sure the sugar is thoroughly moistened. Stick in the candy thermometer and put the mixture on the stove.
3. DO NOT STIR!
4. Heat to 310 degrees and if you have the sugar thoroughly moistened it will look like boiling glass.
5. If you have too much sugar for the liquid you used it will not be clear.
6. When the mixture reaches 300-310 degrees pour into molds generously coated with olive oil (any oil will work).
7. Hold the molds together with heavy duty rubber bands and place the greased molds on a cookie sheet.
8. If you don't have any molds you can oil a cake pan and pour the mixture about 1/4 inch deep and score with a knife as it hardens so it will break into bite size pieces.
9. Its takes about five minutes or so to harden in the molds and as it does I add sticks to make it easier to eat. I wrap them in small plastic bags which you can get wherever they sell candy making supplies.
10. Remember you can't mess this up - if you put in too much corn syrup or water it will just take longer to reach the desired temperature. After your first batch you'll never measure anything again.
11. I should have pointed out that this candy seems to be one of the most traditional Pa. Dutch Christmas candies.
12. NOTE the time is way off.  This is going to vary depending on a lot of factors.,

instructions, 1. Mix ingredients in order given.
2. Flour liberally!  It will start out a bit sticky.  Just keep adding flour to your board and your rolling pin.  Turn it often.
3. Roll to a maximum thickness 1/4" (1 cm).
4. Bake at 350°F until brown and slightly crisp.  It is hard to give a time for how long to bake.  It depends on how many pieces you have on your sheet how thick they are etc.  I found that they all needed a minimum of 8 minutes.  And then I just kept checking every 3 minutes after that.
5. Dust the flour off of the pieces after they have cooled.  A pstry brush works well for this.
6. Glue:  Melt a fair amount of sugar in a large heavy pan over low heat.  Mom used a cast iron pan.  We started with about 2 cups of sugar and ended up adding about another cup.  Keep stirring and waiting.  You want the sugar to get to the point where it is almost a clear brown.  Be careful though the "glue" burns BADLY if dripped on skin.
7. Mom would simply "dip" the edge of the piece that she wanted to glue into the sugar and then press it with the other piece.  When it cools it is VERY hard and holds very well.  It does cool quickly though so work fast.
8. For Icing:  Beat egg whites until stiff.  Slowly add in all of the icing sugar.
9. To make cookies: Bake until lightly browned for soft cookies.  Crisp cookies will keep better though.
10. There is enough dough to make a house and a free form base to put your house on.  Or you can simply make a bunch of cookies with the "leftovers".
11. Mom has some hand drawn pictures of how to cut out the house.  Here are her measurements and directions.
12. Cut 2 side walls: 7" x 4".
13. Cut 2 roof panels: 9 1/2" x 8".
14. Cut 4 chimney pieces: 2 1/4" x 1 1/4" (in two of them cut a 1" V into the bottom so that it will "straddle" the peak of the roof).
15. Cut 2 end walls: 6" x 9" (4" up the sides cut diagonally to the top center to make a point).  In one end cut out door and two windows.  Bake the door along side.
16. For the windows: Place foil underneath and fill with crushed lollipop.  Bake as usual.
17. Base: Simply roll out the leftover dough to make a free form base.  Make sure that it is wide enough for the house.
18. NOTE ABOUT CLEAN-UP: Don't fret!  Your pan that you melted the sugar in is certainly not ruined!  All you need to do is add some hot water let sit for a little while (5-10 minutes) and then rinse it out.  If for some reason that isn't quite working simply heat the pan full of water over low heat for a short while (again about 10 minutes).,

instructions, 1. Build a fire in a fire pit or on a metal Dutch oven camp table with wood or charcoal briquettes. Allow fire to burn down to hot coals. This will take about an hour. Using charcoal and a charcoal starter is even faster - like about 30 minutes. A charcoal starter is a metal tube with a handle that makes lighting charcoal easier. You can find them on the internet or at a camping gear store. We REALLY need to invest in one!
2. While you are waiting for the fire to burn down to hot coals scrub and cube the potatoes into about 1x1" cubes and peel and dice the onion.
3. Spray a 12 quart cast iron Dutch oven with cooking spray. Dump all three cans of cream of chicken soup in the Dutch oven and add three cans of water. Stir soup and water until well mixed.
4. Add potatoes onions baby carrots and chicken to Dutch oven and mix with soup. Make sure the chicken and vegetables are covered (or mostly covered) with soup or they will dry out. If you need to add another can of soup and another can of water. (Today I only used two cans of each and the soup soaked into the chicken and veggies and it was a tad dry.).
5. Flatten out the coals. Put the lid on Dutch oven and put the Dutch oven on top of coals. Put coals on top of lid so the top will cook too. This is most easily performed with a small shovel with a long handle. Especially if the fire pit is deep. It's also nice to have oven mitts on your hands 'cuz that fire gets hot!
6. Cook chicken and vegetables 40 minutes to an hour until chicken is cooked through and potatoes and carrots are fork tender. (Note to Self: Don't take the coals off the lid if you have a Dutch oven with an outside rim like we do. Those coals aren't going to drop into the food and you'll have to scoop them on top of the Dutch oven again.).
7. Open the two cans of biscuits and put them on top of the hot chicken mixture in one layer. Put biscuits close together so they'll all fit.
8. Return lid to Dutch oven and put on coals. Put coals back on the lid if you had to remove them earlier when you checked the chicken mixture. Bake for 8-10 minutes until biscuits are golden brown.
9. Enjoy the fruits of your labor. Speaking of fruit this dish goes well with fresh fruit and/or salad. We had watermelon and grapes today. Once you're done eating the coals will be perfect or s'mores banana boats or other tasty campfire treats.,

instructions, 1. If using left-over chicken or turkey chop it finely and set aside.  Continue with the recipe from Step 3 using stock to make the sauce rather than water and add the chicken or turkey to the sauce at Step 6.
2. If using veal or beef season with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Place a large pan over medium-high heat and melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the veal or beef wine onion clove bay leaves nutmeg or mace parsley thyme lemon zest or juice and water. (Use chicken stock if you have chosen to use chicken or turkey.) Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes to an hour. By this time the meat should be tender (or if using poultry the stock will be bursting with flavor).
4. Strain the stock and reserve along with the meat. Finely chop or cut the meat into into small pieces.
5. Melt the remaining butter in the pan stir in the flour and keep stirring for a few minutes on low heat. Don't let it brown. Slowly and gradually add the stock and cook over moderate heat stirring until the sauce is smooth and thick. Add more flour or corn starch to thicken the sauce if necessary. Cool slightly and add the 3 egg yolks and mix well (reserve the whites for later).
6. Add the veal beef chicken or turkey mix well and season to taste. The mixture should be thick and stiff by this time.
7. Set the mixture aside to cool thoroughly. When ready cut or separate the stiff thick mixture into rolls about 1.5" thick and about 3" long.
8. Spread the crumbs on a clean dry chopping board. Slightly beat the eggwhites in a deep plate until just incorporated. Roll the croquettes through the breadcrumbs then through the egg whites and again through the crumbs. (Make sure that the second coating of crumbs is even and thick and no meat mix sticks out otherwise the croquettes may burst when being deep fried).
9. Deep fry the croquettes in batches of four or five for about 4 minutes or until they are golden brown. Drain on absorbent paper.
10. Serve hot with French fries or fresh chunks of bread. The best way to season is to slather with mustard as the Dutch do!,

instructions, 1. Dice the onion but keep one slice aside for the sauce.
2. In a bowl combine the vegetable oil and kecap manis . Squeeze in the juice of half a lemon. Grate the ginger into the bowl then add the five-spice 1/2 of the salt garlic and stir well.
3. Add the pork to a large casserole pan. Cover the meat with the chopped onion and pour the marinade over. Marinate the pork for 2 hours.
4. Transfer the pork to a large heavy lidded pan. Add the marinade and onions to the pan.
5. Add the remainder of the salt and pour enough water in there so that the pork is covered by 1/2 inch of liquid. Simmer over low heat with the lid on for 60 minutes. Flip the steaks halfway through the cooking process. Turn off the heat and allow the pork to cool in the pan. (At this point you can refrigerate pork chops to finish at another time. Remember to chill onion slice as well).
6. Next mince the slice of onion you set aside and the garlic. Heat the oil and saute the onion and garlic until they soften. Don’t brown them.
7. Add the tomato paste and cook for a minute to sweeten it up. Add the ground ginger water chili sauce brown sugar lemon juice ketchup vinegar and salt. Stir well.
8. Simmer the sauce for 10 to 15 minutes stirring occasionally. The color will deepen and turn more reddish. Taste to check the seasoning. There should be a perfect balance between sweet and sour. Mix corn starch with 1 tbsp water and whisk into the sauce. Simmer for an extra 2 to 3 minutes.
9. Dab the pork steaks completely dry with a clean paper towel. Heat the oil to 355 degrees F and fry the steaks for 1 minute each side. They will almost blacken.
10. Slice the pork and serve along with sauce. White rice and acar campur (Indonesian pickled vegetables) work well with the pork.,

instructions, 1. Clean chicory heads remove outer leaves and cut off about 1 cm from the thick end of the chicory.
2. Fill a large pot with water and add lemon butter and salt add chicory and boil for about 20-30 minutes or until tender (cooking time depends on the size of the chicories) Once cooked drain really well (or all the excess water will leak out later and make your cheese sauce very very thin).
3. Take 2 slices of ham and arrange them slightly overlapping on a cutting board using tongs place a chicory in the middle sprinkle a small amount of the grated gruyere on and roll it up. (when I make this as a main course I personally use 3 slices of ham for each chicory but that's just personal preference).
4. Place the ham rolled chicory in an ovenproof dish.
5. To make the cheese sauce:
6. Melt the butter in a saucepan take off the heat and add the flour using a whisk to blend it into a smooth paste with the cream and then add the milk nutmeg salt and pepper.
7. Return the sauce to the heat to cook and thicken whisking constantly. Don't worry if it looks overly thick no matter how much water you get out of the chicory there will still be some left in there somewhere to make your sauce a little bit thinner.
8. Lastly add the rest of the grated Gruyere to the sauce (and Sbrinz cheese if you are using that too) stir and then pour the sauce over the ham rolled chicorys.
9. Put into a preheated oven at 220 C (425 F) for 10-20 minutes and serve hot.
10. Serve with any pasta type that will coat with the sauce well.
11. NOTE: I sometimes replace the cream with a soya product that we have here called "soya cusine" if you are watching your intake of dairy products cholesterol etc then this is a healthier option and doesn't effect the taste of the dish at all.,

instructions, 1. Melt the butter in the bottom of the pressure cooker toss in the onions celery and garlic and sauté gently for a few minutes. Add salt and pepper.
2. Add the carrot chunks layer the fresh herbs on top (without removing leaves from the tough stalks) then place the chicken fillets on top of that followed by the broccoli endive and any other veggies I want to throw inches
3. DO remember  however that the pressure cooker should not be more than 3/4 full. Fill pressure cooker with water about 1/3rd to 1/2 full. your chicken and veggies should *not* be swimming but there should be enough water to make some decent stock so eyeball the amount of water that you think is about right according to your volume of chicken.
4. Seal and once it's up to pressure cook on moderately high  element for 30-40 minutes (depends on how much chicken I'm doing at once).
5. Turn off the heat and let it de-pressurize as slowly as possible. this slow-er cooling seems to improve the flavour.
6. Once the pressure is off enough take off the lid and let it cool completely.
7. Usually I refrigerate the whole lot overnight and the next day I can just disgard any hardened fat.
8. Carefully remove the chicken pieces and roughly slice --  mine usually obligingly falls to pieces.
9. Discard the woody bits of the fresh herbs.
10. In a large saucepan melt the butter then add the flour stir so that there are no lumps and add several cups of the chicken stock liquid. stir until sauce has thickened somewhat adding as much chicken stock liquid as you need to make a firm but not overcooked sauce you don't want rubber LOL. (Mine is  approx 5-6 cups for the whole mix) using a ladle scoop out all the carrot onion mushed broccoli etc and add it to the sauce mixing well.  Let it cool then add the chicken and mix well you should have a firm ragout type mixture packed with chicken pieces.
11. This mixture comfortably fills TWO 23x23 cm (9 x 9 inch) baking dishes.
12. I can now use this mixture to use in my Pressure cooker Chicken Pastry Pie  Pressure cooker Chicken Potato Bake and if made up until Step 9 for Pressure cooker Chicken Lasagne.,

8. This will prevent you from using too much.

10. Add nutmeg salt and pepper.
11. If you think the sauce is too watery let it simmer uncovered to allow excess water to evaporate.
12. Serve immediately with fragrant rice.
13. This recipe works well with potatoes too-- simply substitute some of the chicken with potatoes.
14. Easy alternative for those too lazy to cook rice separately.,

instructions, 1. Keep potatoes covered with salt water until ready to use or they turn dark and loose much of their appeal.
2. Place bacon in the bottom of the dutch oven enough to make 1/8 inch in oven.  Brown bacon in preheated oven with or without the lid on; If it's windy or many people moving around - it's safer with the lid on.
3. Add onions and cook until transparent.
4. Place potatoes in oven a layer at a time seasoning as you go - Go easy on the salt because of the bacon.
5. When all potatoes are in stir thoroughly so seasoning and bacon and grease are well distributed throughout.
6. Place lid on oven and cover with coals.
7. Beginners be careful and inspect often - Some cooks say stir at each inspection thus insuring the bottom isn't burning -  Personally I think this results in broken and mushy potatoes. I after the initial stirring leave them alone -  If I’m doubtful about the bottom I take a spatula or spoon and slip under the potatoes and lift enough to.
8. check the progress then slip spatula out leaving potatoes disturbed as little as possible by sampling frequently you can announce when done. (usually around 20 minutes).
9. *my advice - go easy with the coals when you are beginning.  Keep them well dispensed on the bottom of the oven and the top.  Use your "tool" to turn the dutch oven around on the coals often and move the top around a bit to keep the temperature inside even*.,

9. Using just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to the work surface or to your fingers gently shape it into a ball. Generously coat a clean dish towel with flour wheat bran or cornmeal.
10. Put the seam side of the dough down on the towel and dust with more flour bran or cornmeal.
11. Cover with another towel and let rise for about 1 to 2 hours.
12. When it’s ready the dough will have doubled in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.
13. At least 20 minutes before the dough is ready heat oven to 475 degrees.
14. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron enamel Pyrex or ceramic) in the oven as it heats.
15. When the dough is ready carefully remove the pot from the oven and lift off the lid. Slide your hand under the towel and turn the dough over into the pot seam side up.
16. The dough will lose its shape a bit in the process but that’s OK. Give the pan a firm shake or two to help distribute the dough evenly but don’t worry if it’s not perfect; it will straighten out as it bakes.
17. Cover and bake for 30 minutes.
18. Remove the lid and bake another 15 to 20 minutes until the loaf is beautifully browned.
19. Remove the bread from the Dutch oven and let it cool on a rack for at least 1 hour before slicing.,

2. In a large Dutch oven cook bacon until crispy. Set aside and save drippings.
3. Now you are going to sear your beef. Turn the heat up to med-high and add some oil if you don't have enough bacon grease.Make sure the beef is dry. Wet meat won't brown! Work in small batches searing the beef in the dutch oven until it is brown on all sides. Remove beef and set aside.
4. Turn the heat down to med and saute onion until soft. Add garlic and saute 1 minute.
5. Return beef to pan. Salt and pepper it to taste. Now add the flour and stir it around so everything is covered. Put the dutch oven in the preheated oven uncovered for 5 minutes. Stir then cook for another 5 minutes. This is cooking the flour and giving it a bit of a crust. (and it's how Julia Child's does it so I won't argue!).
6. After the beef and flour has cooked take the dutch oven out and turn oven down to 200. Add everything else to the pot (including the cooked chopped bacon) except mushrooms. The liquid should be enough to just barely cover the meat not drown it.
7. Bake covered @ 200 for the next 2 - 2.5 hours. You want the beef to simmer on low so you may have to adjust the temperature. Add the mushrooms in the last half hour of cooking. Meat is done when fork tender.,

instructions, 1. For the dough:
2. Sieve the flour brown sugar vanilla and the salt into a bowl.
3. Cut the butter or margarine into small cubes and add these to the flour mixture.
4. Beat the egg and add 3/4 of it to the flour mixture (you will need the rest for the top).
5. Using two knives mix the butter/margarine and the flour mixture.
6. Using one hand kneed it to form the dough - you should be able to form it into a ball (this may take quite long).
7. Put the ball of dough in the fridge for about an hour in the meantime make the filling.
8. For the filling:
9. Peel the apples and cut them in cubes (allow the sizes to vary--it'll taste better).
10. In a (large) bowl combine apple raisins (granulated) sugar cinnamon the lemon juice  and half of the semolina.
11. Mix well and allow the flavors to blend stirring occasionally.
12. Then:
13. Butter a 9-inch round springform cake pan or spray it with a non-stick spray.
14. Line the pan (bottom and sides) with about 3/4 of the dough - as long as the pan is covered the layer need not be very thick.
15. Cover the bottom with the remaining semolina.
16. Add the filling but try to leave the juices out.
17. On a lightly floured surface roll out the remaining dough until it's less than 1/4 inch (1/2 cm) thick.
18. Cut the dough into strips and layer them over the apple pie to form a raster covering no more than one third of the surface--you should be able to see quite a bit of the apple pieces (see picture).
19. If necessary use (some of) the remaining dough to make the edges a bit higher.
20. Use the remaining egg to coat the dough strips.
21. Bake the pie at 175°C / 340°F just below the middle of your oven for about 75 minutes.

instructions, 1. Rinse and clean whole chicken taking out the giblets. You can cook these with the chicken for flavour if you like.
2. Place your chicken into your Dutch oven or a large stock pot. I have "Vintage" Reverware and love it! But you use what you have. A 6 quart size is good.
3. Fill the pot with water to cover the chicken about 1/4 inch more over the chicken if you have room.
4. Turn you burner on high with your stockpot centered and bring the water to a boil. Then turn the heat down to a slow boil and add the onion pepper and powdered garlic. This will flavor you chicken.
5. Cook the chicken through until a fork pierces the main part easily do not cook it off the bone or you'll have chicken mush not soup.
6. I set a very large Pyrex bowl in my sink get out my largest stainless steel colander and place it in the bowl and pour the whole pot of broth and chicken into the colander. Be careful about the steam so it doesn't scald you!
7. Set the pot back on the stove (You did turn it off for now right?).
8. Lift the colander out of the bowl straining the juice through it. Set it on a large plate or cutting board.
9. Carefully pour the broth from the bowl to the stock pot. Turn the heat back on and simmer the broth. Add more water if necessary to bring the level up to about an inch from the rim of you pot. Use less liquid if you want less soup.
10. Add potatoes celery carrots rice and bouillon cubes to your broth at this point. Cover and simmer at a slow boil to continue to cook.
11. On your cutting board: use a fork and knife to pull pieces from the cooked chick leaving the skin fat and bones to discard. I don't keep the onion from this either it's just to flavor the soup. If you like you can break the leg and thigh bones and add them to the broth so their marrow can continue to flavour the soup. Discard these bones before serving.
12. Cut the chicken meat to sizes you like.
13. Check your vegetables if they are almost cooked add your chicken back into the stockpot. Taste your broth and add seasonings and salt to taste. I have people who are sensitive to salt so I don't cook with it often but it's on my table.
14. Finish simmering until vegetables are done. Turn off the heat.
15. If you are making biscuits leave the cover on and bake your biscuits now while the soup "sets". If your family is like mine this gives you a good excuse for a "breather" while your biscuits bake and it sound so "secret recipe-ish".,

3. Carefully remove the meat from the pot as it will be extremely tender. Set on a cutting board and allow it to rest until it firms up a bit about 10 minutes. Slice or shred to serve. I discard the cooking liquid but it can be used to cook cabbage and other vegetables if desired.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350 and cook sausages in there until crispy (about 20 minutes).
2. While sausages are cooking on the stove top take the onions garlic and saute in a non-stick pan.  If onions are frozen --  you shouldn't need to use oil because as the onions melt --  the water will lubricate the pan. (calorie saver!) When they start to stick start to gradually add in the veggie stock. Reduce heat and simmer.
3. While those 2 things are working  scoop the mashed cauliflower-broccoli on to the plate.
4. When sausages are done put them on the plate with the mashed cauliflower-broccoli.
5. Add a squirt of brown sauce into the onion mixture (less than a teaspoon) and mix one last time before pouring this onion gravy over the "mashed cauliflower-broccoli".
6. Serve hot.  Yum!,

2. Reduce the heat to low and simmer partially covered for about 3 hours or until the brisket is tender and shows no resistance when pierced deeply with the point of a skewer or small knife.  (Check the pot from time to time.  The water should cover the brisket throughout the entire cooking time; add boiling water to the casserole if needed.).
3. Meanwhile in a heavy 2 to 3 quart saucepan bring 1 quart of water to a boil over high heat.  Drop in the dried beans (1 cup dried horticultural shell beans such as cranberry beans or substitute dried pink or pinto beans (1/2 pound)  and boil them for about 2 minutes. (The water should cover the beans by at least 2 inches; if necessary add more.)
4. Turn off the heat and let the beans soak for 1 hour.

Scrub the beets under cold running water then place them in a 3 to 4 quart saucepan and pour in enough cold water to cover them by 2 inches.  Bring to a boil over high heat reduce the heat to low cover the pan and simmer until the beets show no resistance when pierced with the point of a small skewer or knife.  This may take from 30 minutes to 2 hours; add boiling water to the beets if necessary.  Drain the beets and when they are cool enough to handle slip off their skins.

11. After about 24 hours of brewing itself the bottle will start to feel hard as the pressure builds.
12. After three/four days the bottle should be very hard -- resist the urge to shake it up or open it you will ruin your root beer.  Place in refrigerator overnight. This arrests the yeast action.
13. After chilling decant into a glass and enjoy.
14. Note: There will be leftover yeast in some sludge at the bottom of the bottle. Be careful decanting as you get to bottom of the bottle. That yeast will be skunky.
15. Another note:  The yeast is still working! Drink this up right away keep it chilled.,

instructions, 1. Heat a large Dutch oven and add a tablespoon of olive oil.
2. If you have a big piece of meat cut it in half or in quarters.
3. On high heat brown each side of the meat and sear it so you get burnt little bits stuck to the bottom of your pan.  This will create deep flavor!
4. Add the onions all around the meat and saute for a few minutes or until the onions begin to soften.  Turn the heat to medium if the onions are scorching but keep stirring them around.
5. Once the onions are near translucent pour both bottles of Guinness over the meat.
6. Add the thyme and other spices and stir.
7. Cover and cook on low heat simmering for about 2 hours.  At this point your meat should shred slightly when poked with a fork.  If it doesn't let it cook for another half hour and check again.
8. Once the meat is at the just shredding point make a slurry of the cornstarch and a bit of water and poor into the pot and gently stir.
9. The sauce should thicken a bit as it continues to cook over the next few minutes.
10. Season the gravy with salt and pepper to your liking.
11. Serve with mashed potatoes and veggies for true comfort food!,

3. Transfer the mixture to a blender and puree until smooth. Return to pan and stir in the scallions. Set aside covered.
4. Large pot bring I inch salted water to boil. ADD Cabbage cover and cook until tender. 8 to 10 minutes; drain well (sometimes I steam the cabbage).
5. Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with cold salted water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium and cook until tender.
6. Drain potatoes and return to pan. Mash with a potato masher Or any instrument you have. hands egg beater--fists--whatever best if using a masher though.
7. Gradually add sour cream and mash until smooth.  Watch the consistency  You do not want a mixture that looks like soup.  So add slowly.
8. Stir in cabbage and season with the salt and pepper.
9. Add the grated cheese lastly.
10. Meat lovers may add crisp bacon when mixing. I have put Italian sausage(fried and cut up into very small pieces) into this dish. Any type of sausage is good--even Brats.
11. May garnish with Italian parsley.
12. THIS REALLY IS TO DIE FOR.
13. I usually put in a bowl and find a pan where the bowl sits on top covered. Add a bit of water to pan under low heat and it keeps the potatoes hot until serving time. Must stir occasionally. This also helps to melt the cheese.
14. This trick may be done with other foods.
15. NOTE:
16. Boniato potatoes are found in an Asian Market.  They are a mix between Yukon Gold and a Sweet Potato. They are just simply to delicious. So I rarely buy another potato since these are the best.
17. The Boniato peels like a regular potato. Just has a harder Brown skin. YOU MUST TAKE OUT THE THIN VEIN THAT RUNS DOWN THE CENTER::
18. Quarter them lengthwise and take out the very thin vein that runs down the center. It is a bit bitter. Then chop as a regular potato.,

3. Combine the coconut milk moss and ice cubes in a blender and blend well until all of the Irish moss pieces have been pulverized. Stop blending halfway through and scrape down the sides and lid of the blender with a spatula to get any remaining pieces of moss. The warmer the mixture becomes the thicker and pastier it will be and it will begin to stick to the sides of the blender so try to keep it cool. The coconut milk can be put in the refrigerator to stay cold before blending.

Return the large saucepan to a boil and allow the juices from the cooking process to reduce until only about 1 cup remains.

Add the curry powder and cook for an additional 5 minutes stirring occasionally to incorporate all of the ingredients and allow the curry to toast slightly. Add the 1 cup of cooking juices and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. Add 1/3 cup of the Irish moss mixture if you choose as well as salt and black pepper to taste and continue cooking stirring occasionally for 15 more minutes.

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 450F/230C/Gas Mark 6.  DO NOT START UNTIL OVEN IS READY.  Then ignore the doorbell telephone and cell phone until your bread is in the oven.  For best results measure everything before you begin.
2. Sieve the flour bread soda salt and about 2 teaspoons of sugar into a large bowl and mix in the fruit. Whisk about 1 1/3 cup of the milk together with the egg. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in almost all of the milk and egg mixture. Quickly and with a light touch use your fingers to quickly and lightly bring the flour in from the edges and mix with the milk until all the ingredients come together into a dough.
3. Use your hands not a spoon or mixer. Work quickly and lightly.
4. The dough should be soft rather than wet or sticky. If it is too dry add a little more of the milk and egg mix or the of the remaining buttermilk. Once it has come together do not knead just place it on a floured wooden board pick up a handful of flour and rub it into the palms of your hands so that they are perfectly dry and and then shape the dough into a round about 2 inches thick.
5. Brush the top of the dough with some of the remaining milk and sprinkle the rest of the sugar over it. Cut a deep cross on the top of the dough.
6. Put the bread into the oven immediately.
7. After 5 minutes turn the oven down to 400ºF (200ºC/regulo 6). The initial high temperature gives the bread a nice brown crust.
8. After another 25 minutes take the bread out and knock on the base. If it sounds hollow it is done if not return it to the oven for about 5 minutes and then check again.
9. Eat the day of baking or toast it the next day.,

2. Mix together white wheat flour salt and sugar.
3. Cut shortening or butter into flour. I like to leave pretty good size chunks of shortening or butter to make the pie crust more flaky.
4. Add ICE COLD water a Tbsp at a time until flour/shortening pieces stick together and are ballable. ** I always add a different amount of water when doing pie crust. At most you may use a 1/4 C of water and at least you may use 1/8°C I think it depends on the moisture in the flour/sugar/salt/air as to how much you would add.**.
5. Split ball into half and roll out bottom and top of pie crust to a 1/2 centimeter thickness.
6. FILLING: Fills 2 pie crusts
7. Flour pork chops and cook in frying pan on med-low heat with butter. Take out cube and set aside.
8. Cube sweet potatoes onion red pepper Fresno pepper and spices into frying pan with chicken broth. Bring to boil and simmer for 15-20 minute
9. Put an equal ratio of flour and butter together in a small cup (usually one tbsp to one tbsp is enough) mix into broth and veggies. This will thicken the broth to make it more like a gravy. You can use several different techniques to thicken broth.
10. Add cubed pork and sour cream to frying pan.
11. Simmer for a few min then pour into pie crust. Cover with 2nd layer of crust. Bake for 50 min at 375.,

instructions, 1. Peel the potatoes. Cut large ones into three or four pieces: leave smaller ones whole. Finely chop the parsley. Boil the water and in it dissolve the bouillon cube.
2. Grill or broil the sausages and bacon long enough to colour them. Be careful not to dry them out! Drain briefly on paper towels. When drained chop the bacon into one-inch pieces. If you like chop the sausages into large pieces as well. (Some people prefer to leave them whole.).
3. Preheat the oven to 300F / 150°C In a large flameproof heavy pot with a tight lid start layering the ingredients: onions bacon sausages or sausage pieces potatoes. Season each layer liberally with fresh-ground pepper and the chopped fresh parsley. Continue until the ingredients are used up. Pour the bouillon mixture over the top. On the stove bring the liquid to a boil. Immediately turn the heat down and cover the pot. (You may like to additionally put a layer of foil underneath the pot lid to help seal it.).
4. Put the covered pot in the oven and cook for at least three hours. (Four or five hours won't hurt it.) At the two-hour point check the pot and add more water if necessary. There should be about an inch of liquid at the bottom of the pot at all times.
5. To Serve. Guinness bottled or draft goes extremely well with this dish (indeed adding a little to the pot toward the end of the process wouldn't hurt anything). Another good accompaniment is fresh soda bread used to mop up the gravy!,

2. Rinse the starch from the shredded potato until water runs clear.
3. Soak the shredded potato in cold salty water for 15 minutes. Sometimes I add a little sugar to sweeten the potatoes slightly.
4. Drain potato but do not pat dry.  You need some excess water.
5. Melt the butter in the pan over medium heat then add potato and mix together. Then add salt pepper and garlic powder.
6. Gather potato into a thin layer then cover the pan and allow potato to steam until the pieces are cooked.  They'll end up looking wilted and a little sad but you want them nice and soft or you'll have tough hash browns.  Add seasoning until it suits your taste.
7. Remove cover slide softened potato to one side add cooking oil to where the hash brown will rest in the pan. Raise heat to Medium High.
8. Using a spatula put potato onto the oil then form it into the shape you want but don't make the layer too thin. It's still going to condense down and you'll want some soft unbrowned potato in the center.
9. Cook until golden brown on the bottom.  At first the potato may stick to the pan but it'll eventually release once it's nice and crispy and holds together. This should take 5-10 minutes.
10. Using a large spatula lift up the hash brown and add oil under it for the unbrowned side.
11. Flip unbrowned side onto the oil.  This can be difficult so be careful and quick.
12. Tidy up the edges of the hash brown and allow to cook until browned another 5-10 minutes.
13. Enjoy!  I usually end up adding a bit more salt and garlic powder but I love them.,

cuisine, European >> Irish >> Irish, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. BEFORE YOU BEGIN (OPTIONAL): Lay out bread slices and allow to get a crusty as possible (I will usually set out at least 24 hours in advance.) This allows the bread to become very dry and crusty so it can absorb as much pudding as possible. ALSO combine the raisins and whiskey in a small bowl cover and place in the refrigerator overnight to allow the raisins to soak up as much whiskey as possible. If you forget the raisins only need to sit for about 30 minutes to soak up quite a bit of whiskey.
2. JACK DANIEL'S CARAMEL-WHISKEY SAUCE: Combine sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir continuously until sugar dissolves.
3. Simmer until sugar mixture is golden (about 17 minutes). DO NOT STIR!
4. Remove from heat.
5. Carefully add butter and cream cheese stirring constantly with a whisk until all clumps are dissolved. CAUTION! Mixture will bubble vigorously and release a lot of hot steam.
6. Cool slightly. Stir in whiskey and milk. Mixture will bubble a bit at this step as well.
7. PUDDING: Preheat oven to 350°F.
8. Brush melted butter on one side of French bread slices.
9. Bake buttered side up until lightly toasted about 10 minutes.
10. Cut bread into 1/2 inch cubes and set aside.
11. Combine milk sugar vanilla extract evaporated milk eggs and UNDRAINED whiskey mixture in a large bowl. Stir well with a whisk.
12. Add bread cubes pressing down gently to moisten; let stand about 20 minutes. If your bowl is a little small gently fold the cubes into the mixture with a spatula.
13. Pour bread mixture into a 13 x 9-inch baking dish coated well with cooking spray.
14. Combine sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over pudding.
15. Bake at 350F for 35 minutes or until set.
16. Serve warm with Jack Daniel's caramel-whiskey sauce.
17. TO MAKE THIS KID FRIENDLY: Substitute apple juice for Jack Daniel's in pudding and 1 tablespoon imitation rum extract and 3 tablespoons water in Caramel-Whiskey sauce.,

instructions, 1. Mix all ingredients EXCEPT brisket in a bowl.
2. Place brisket in a vacuum bag.  Apply rub to all sides of brisket.
3. Vacuum and seal bag.  (If you don't have a food vacuum system use a ziplock and squeeze out the air you can manage.).
4. Refrigerate for 2 days (for vacuumed) to 4 days (for ziplock only) massaging through bag and turning over every 12 hours.
5. Two hours before cooking remove bag from refrigerator.
6. Place a rack or metal steamer in the bottom of a large pot to create a space so the bag can't rest on the bottom during cooking.  Place sealed bag containing the brisket in the steamer and add water until the bag is completely covered.  Remove bag from pot.
7. Bring water to a boil.  Place bag gently in boiling water.  (It's important to maintain the seal on the bag because a leaky bag will cut way back on the flavor.)  When the water reaches a low simmer reduce the heat to maintain the water at barely bubbling.
8. Simmer the brisket in the bag for 5 hours adding water to keep the bag submerged as needed turning the bag over every 30 minutes.
9. When 5 hours is up remove the bag from the water open and rinse the brisket in hot running water to remove the remaining rub.
10. If serving as corned beef as in a New England boiled dinner slice about 1/8" to 1/4" thick and serve with boiled potatoes and cabbage.
11. If serving on a sandwich chill the corned beef back down to below 40 degrees F and slice 1/16" thick using a deli slicer or very sharp knife.,

2. For the scones: Place an oven rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silpat or parchment paper. Set aside.
3. In the bowl of a food processor pulse together the flour sugar baking powder rosemary salt and butter until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl. Gradually stir in the cream until the mixture forms a dough. On a lightly floured work surface roll out the dough into a 1/2-inch thick 10-inch circle. Using a 3-inch heart-shaped cookie cutter cut out heart-shaped pieces of dough and put on the prepared baking sheet. Gently knead together any leftover pieces of dough and roll out to 1/2-inch thick. Cut the dough into more heart shapes and add to the baking sheet. Using an index finger or a small round measuring spoon gently make an indentation in the center of each pastry heart. Spoon a heaped 1/2 teaspoon of jam into each indentation. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Transfer the cooked scones onto a wire rack and cool for 30 minutes.
4. For the glaze: In a medium bowl mix together the lemon juice and powdered sugar until smooth. Gradually add the water until the mixture is thin enough to spread. Using a spoon drizzle the glaze over the scones. Let the glaze set for about 30 minutes. Serve or store in an airtight plastic container for 2 days.
5. Cook's Note: The dough can also be made by hand by stirring together the flour sugar baking powder rosemary and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter. Using your fingertips or a pastry blender work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Gradually stir in the cream until the mixture forms a dough.,

instructions, 1. Remove briskets from wrapping and place in large pot or crockpot.  Rinse if you don't like the brine coating.
2. Add contents of 1 spice packet (discard 2nd spice packet or reserve for other use) the beer peppercorns and bay leaves.
3. Break garlic head apart and peel each clove.  Add entire head to the pot.
4. Add enough water to cover the meat by 1 inch.  NOTE:  the briskets will float so I put a heavy heat-resistant plate or bowl on top to keep them submerged.
5. STOVETOP:  Turn heat to high and bring contents to a boil.  Turn heat to a low simmer; cover and cook for 6 hours or more.
6. CROCKPOT:  Set on high cover; cook for 8-10 hours.
7. When done using 2 large spoons or spatulas carefully remove briskets to serving platter and let rest.  The meat will be extremely tender and will easily break apart if you use a meat fork.
8. If using for sandwiches tightly wrap each brisket in plastic and refrigerate for 1-2 hours before slicing.  If you want to shred the meat there is no need to refrigerate--just cut in thick slices and shred each slice.
9. If serving as corned beef & cabbage once meat is removed transfer cooking liquid to large pot (if using crockpot) bring cooking liquid to boil and add vegetables.  Cover and cook 30 minutes.,

instructions, 1. Start with a pound of green split peas. (You’ll find them in the grocery store near dried beans.) Rinse them in cold water. Put the peas in a pot and cover with about two inches of water.
2. Bring to a boil and let simmer without a lid for about an hour. Stir frequently to keep the solids from scorching on the bottom and add water as needed. (The soup will thicken as it cooks and the water evaporates so keep that in mind.).
3. When the peas are mostly cooked and have lost their form add the vegetables and more water if needed. Add 1 tsp of salt some pepper if desired and a bay leaf.
4. Let simmer for about 30 minutes then salt to taste.
5. Add egg noodles if desired and simmer until the noodles are tender about 8-10 minutes.
6. Stir in the parsley salt to taste and ladle into soup bowls. Garnish with a sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese.

instructions, 1. Firstly make sure you have a pan that's big enough for the whole shabang. Very important!
2. When buying the corned beef ALWAYS buy the flat cut. The point cut is almost all fat. This is no good unless that's what you want. If so never mind this step! :) The flat cuts do better on the last step though.
3. Empty contents of corned beef into pan. Squeeze out the red goop into the water too. It makes a big deal! Add onion and the spice packet or bay leaf peppercorns allspice cloves and mustard seed in with the juices. Fill the pan with water until the meat is covered by an inch or two. Maybe more if you think it needs it.
4. Bring to a boil. Once boiling reduce heat to a simmer. Otherwise it will boil over. That is one big smelly mess --  Trust me. Make sure the water doesn't get too low and that it's not in danger of boiling over.
5. Boil for about an hour per pound. Yes it's a long and slow process but so worth it. Hang in there. On the bright side you have plenty of time to prep your potatoes set the table and make my tasty Light and Fluffy Yeast Rolls!
6. The last hour add the potatoes and carrots.
7. Quarter the cabbage and add in the last 20-30 minutes depending on how soggy you like it. Make sure the cabbage is on the very top and avoid stirring so the chunks don't separate in the water.
8. When the meat is done it will still look pink.
9. Cover cookie sheet with foil and place the meat on it FAT SIDE UP.
10. Coat meat with the mustard then press brown sugar into it. You will have very gooey hands.
11. Wipe hands then sprinkle ground cloves on top.
12. Turn on the broiler and place meat underneath. Broil for just a few minutes. You will know when it is done-- it's a beautiful glazy beast of a meal.
13. Place veggies in a platter. Serve the corned beef sliced against the grain right next to them.
14. You won't believe your tastebuds.,

instructions, 1. Prep all ingredients as mentioned in the list.  The recipe editor can be a pain so when it comes to the shellfish you can use a pound of clam and/or mussel meat.  I used a combination of already cooked shelled and frozen meat. You can obviously cook and shell your own.  I used smoked salmon and hake for my fish choices; but any combination listed would work just great. The spirit of Irish Seafood Chowder is in using what's locally caught and available so try to do the same.
2. Add butter and onions to a pot and sweat until onions are translucent.
3. Add the carrots and celery and continue to sweat for a few more minutes.
4. Add the flour to the mix and allow it to "cook out" the raw flour flavor.
5. Add the potatoes smoked fish clam juice and seafood stock to the pot.
6. At this point you can let the chowder simmer for a while but at least 15 minutes or so.  I had done everything up to now before my guests arrived and then finished the following steps in the last 10 minutes prior to eating.
7. Add all of the remaining ingredient to the pot (shellfish meat cubed fish and heavy cream). Cook for 5-10 minutes until fish is done.
8. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve with Irish Brown Bread & butter.,

instructions, 1. On medium-high or high heat sautee the onion mushroom and garlic in the butter until nicely browned - do not burn but make sure it's hot enough to really sizzle and give some nice colour.
2. Season with garlic salt (or regular) cayenne and pepper.
3. When the pan is beginning to brown with bits stuck to it add in the soy sauce Maggi sauce wines and brandy.  The pan might hiss and spit when you pour it in; don't worry.
4. Stir well and bring to a simmer.  Taste (it will be strong) and add more wine if necessary to get a good balanced flavour.
5. Add vegetable broth tasting frequently until desired flavour has been reached (this is to mellow out the alcohol and completely up to you).
6. When the flavour is perfect stir in the cornstarch already mixed with water (to avoid clumps) a little at a time until desired consistency.
7. The gravy shouldn't be too thick; you want to be able to pour it out like normal roast gravy (like a jus).
8. Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. In a blender add Jell-O Gelatin and then Water (boiling). Cover and blend on low speed until dissolved (about 30 seconds).
2. Pour in Ice Water and Alcohol (ice-cold) re-cover and blend on high speed for 1 minute.
3. Uncover and equally pour into 20 (2 oz.) Plastic Portion Cups 3/4 full carefully seal with Lids and place level in refrigerator.
4. Allow to chill overnight. The Shots will stay good all weekend!
5. TIP: A good rule of thumb for choosing basic Jello Shots flavors is to pick only Blue Purple or Red colors. They just taste better.
6. TIP: 1/2 tablespoon Powdered or Granulated Gelatin equals 1 (0.25 oz) envelope Unflavored Gelatin.
7. TIP: Measure Water (boiling) only after it has finished heating.
8. TIP: Add small ice pieces with cold water to make 1 equal cup Ice Water. It melts and blends better.
9. TIP: Make sure Alcohol is (ice-cold) by "freezing" bottle for at least 3 hours.
10. TIP: Plastic Portion Cups can be obtained at most restaurant supply stores --  don't forget the lids!
11. TIP: Put a drop of Yellow Food Coloring in the Blue Jell-O for St. Patrick's Day.,

instructions, 1. Grate the celery onion and carrot into a small bowl.  You want this mixture to be as fine as possible.
2. Cube the potatoes into pieces about the size of a dime or smaller.  Shape isn't important but size is.  So if you prefer rectangles to cubes knock yourself out!
3. Heat the butter in a large skillet and add the all the vegetables to it.  Cover and let this cook on medium-low heat for about 8 minutes.  You will need to stir this occasionally so that the potatoes cook through.
4. Add the salt garlic salt and Worcestershire and let it cook for another 2 minutes over low heat.
5. Add the flour to the mixture slowly and stir it in as you go.  You want the mixture to thicken but you don't want it to dry out.  If it looks dry add butter until it's liquid enough to move around the pan easily.
6. Move the mixture over to a stock pot or soup kettle and cook at low heat.  Add the beer cream milk mustard bay leaves thyme and chicken stock and whisk briefly to combine the items.  The soup should now be a white-yellow color.
7. SLOWLY add the shredded cheese to the soup 1 handful at a time.  Whisk constantly while you add the cheese and try to ensure the cheese stays off the sides and bottom of the pot.  If you're using a yellow cheese the soup should begin to take on that color.
8. Add the nacho cheese to the soup and whisk vigorously until it's combined.
9. Cover and let the mixture heat for about 5 minutes on medium-low heat stirring occasionally.  It's important to make sure the soup NEVER boils or the ingredients will start to separate.
10. Serve with cracked pepper and bacon bits!,

3. Dark raisins may be subsituted but will make a darker slightly heavier loaf.
4. The sugar in the raisins creates a darker crust; use your machine's"light crust setting" if it has one.
5. Dried butter milk can generally be found in the baking goods section of your supermarket.
6. If you can't find buttermilk regular dried milk can be substituted.
7. If using delayed time bake place raisins atop dry ingredients away from liquid.

instructions, 1. PRESSURE COOKER REQUIRED!
2. WARNING--Consult instructions for use with your pressure cooker to avoid accident or injury Sear the roast in a very hot pan with olive oil on all sides so that there is a good brown crust on the surfaces.  (This will insure that all of the juices stay in the meat)
3. Then season with onion powder garlic powdersalt pepper and/or seasonings of choice.
4. Place roast in the pressure cooker and submerge meat half of the way up the roast with water (not halfway up the pan) Cover roast with 1 can of Golden Mushroom Soup (I use Campbell's) and the packet of Onion Soup mix (I use Lipton) DO NOT mix the soup and dry ingredients just pour on top to cover the roast and toss in 2 bay leaves.
5. Cover Pressure cooker and bring to the beautiful sound of hissing and rocking!
6. (Shake shake shake --  shake your toggle top!) Having Fun Yet!
7. No? Well pause for a tasty beverage!
8. Cooking is so fun!
9. At this timecut up your veggies into large chunks.
10. (NOTE: Believe it or not turnips give this a very nice subtle flavor that blends very well. Take it from someone who DOESN'T like turnips in anything else try it if typically you wouldn't--it makes the dish!) Usual cooking time for the pressure cooker is 2lbs of meat= 30 minutes 3lbs of meat= about 45 minutes After finished cooking for amount of meat let container cool until it depressurizes and the"indicator" drops/collapses indicating it's safe to take the cover off.
11. Open and take out roast--place in a covered dish to keep warm-- there should be a nice brown liquid at the bottom of the pan with the consistency of a thin/med-thick gravy.
12. Add a little water if it's too thick (you need liquid to produce pressure!) Add the vegetables and bring back the"Boogie-Dancing Toggle" top!
13. WoooHooo!
14. (Do a little dance make a little roast -- ) Cook for approx 7 minutes.
15. This time after the 7 minutes cool the pressure cooker quickly under cool water in the sink.
16. Open and Slainte'!
17. You can serve with Irish Soda Bread (or whatever bread you prefer).
18. This is a whole meal that doesn't really take very long!

instructions, 1. For the bread I use Ciabatta (Italian"Slipper" Bread)#29100 by Lisa Pizza (we make 4 small loaves rather than 2 medium-sized loaves if we intend to make sandwiches).
2. For the corned beef I find the biggest corned beef I can locate (usually about 4-5 pounds) and prepare it with corned beef and cabbage#52008 by chia.
3. Slice both loaves of bread horizontally like a sandwich.
4. Arrange corned beef on bottom half of sandwich dividing meat evenly between the two loaves.
5. Arrange cheese to cover the meat.
6. We use our toaster oven to melt the cheese adding the top of the sandwich the last minute or so so both halves are warm but the top half doesn't get over-crunchy.
7. Alternately you can wrap the whole thing up in foil and bake for less crunchy bread.
8. (the crust is the best part of ciabatta so I toast it in the open) Once your cheese is melted put the top half of the bread on the bottom half cut in half to make wedges and enjoy!
9. We don't usually have sides of any kind for this meal since the sandwich is a very good size.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to Gas Mark 6 400F or 200C Grease or butter a large baking/cookie tray.
2. Sift flour and mustard powder or cayenne pepper into a bowl. Rub in the butter until it resembles fine breadcrumbs.
3. Add just over three-quarters of the cheese and the chopped spring onion and mix well. Stir in the eggs and yogurt; I have suggested between 2 and 4 tablespoons of yoghut add it a tablespoon at a time to get the right consistency. The dough will be very soft. Knead very lightly on a WELL floured surface.
4. Pat out dough to about 2.5cm (1in) deep and cut out about 5 scones. Knead the trimmings and pat out then cut out another 2-3 scones. Put the scones on the baking sheet and sprinkle with the rest of the cheese and more cayenne if you like.
5. Bake for 20 - 25 minutes until golden brown and risen. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 15 to 30 minutes.
6. Best served warm with butter and a sliver of cheese or spread with cream cheese and ham.
7. Tip: Use a larger cutter to make bigger scones then serve them with spinach and a poached egg on top. Bake them for slightly longer.
8. To freeze: cool and pack in polybag. Seal label and freeze. Use within 2 months. Thaw at room temperature. Warm through in the oven for serving.,

2. Remove and discard the neck giblets and any excess fat from the chicken.  Rinse the chicken inside and out under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Lightly spray or brush all over with the vegetable oil and season inside and out with the rub.  Let rest at room temperature while you preheat your grill.
3. Open the beer can an pour off half of the beer.  (Or drink it if you don't want to waste it.)  Set the half-full can of beer in can holder (or if you don't have a can holder just be extra careful and place the can on a flat smooth surface) and add fresh rosemary leaves minced shallot and lemon juice.  This will help add moisture and flavor from the inside as your chicken cooks.  You may need to use a funnel to help add the ingredients to the can.

8. Bake in preheated oven for 15-18 minutes or until scones are golden-brown and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.

instructions, 1. In a crock pot/slow cooker combine water carrots and onion and cook on high till carrots bite easily but are not soft. (About 2.5 to 3 hours).
2. Empty the dry peas into a strainer and inspect for stones or other unwanted items. Rinse with cold water and empty into crock pot with bay leaves and salt. Cook on high for two hours.
3. Empty bag of real crumbled bacon into mix and cook at additional hour.
4. Serve hot.
5. (NOTES)
6. #1. Cooking the peas for at least three hours on high in a crock pot creates it's own creaminess and I do not recommend adding dairy to this recipe at all. Since I like my peas with a bite that matches the consistency of the bacon I cut the heat after three hours. But if you like your pea soup more smooth cook an additional hour or two.
7. #2. You can omit the salt from the recipe as the bacon will add enough sodium to the recipe but I think the salt highlights the sweetness of the peas and carrots.
8. #3. You could omit the bacon to make it completely Non-Fat but I don't think it would taste as good.,

instructions, 1. In a two-quart sauce pan bring one quart of water to a rolling boil.
2. While it is reaching a boil Cut a long flap in each jalapeno starting from the shoulder and running close to the tip; this should be an elogated"V" shaped flap.
3. Lift the flap and clean out the fibers and seeds (this is where most of the heat is); I use either a round-tipped peeling device or a teaspoon.
4. When water reaches boiling point immerse cleaned peppers in the water and reduce heat to medium.
5. Let peppers parboil for about 10 minutes-- better that they be a little undercooked then overcooked.
6. Mix the rest of the ingredients together turning and blending until the cream cheese is well mixed into the rest of the ingredients.
7. If the mixture seems too dry add a little sour cream pickle juice vinegar anything in the fridge you think might add a touch of individuality.
8. Remove peppers dump into a strainer and run cold water over them.
9. Lift the flap of each pepper and stuff the cheese mixture into the pocket; fold the flap backdown over the stuffing.
10. A little overstuffing is OK.
11. Place the peppers on a sprayed pan and bake at 400 degrees for about 10- 15 minutes; just until the cheese begins to melt out of the peppers.
12. Remove and let cool for about 4- 5 minutes so the cheese sets up a little.
13. Serve with a few crackers or tortilla chips and your favorite beer.
14. Parboiling the peppers removes a substantial portion of the raw heat but leaves enough to give a nice burn to the mouth.,

2. Mix the boiling water cream of tartar and nearly all of the caster sugar with the ginger and lemons.
3. When the mixture has cooled to be luke-warm add the beaten egg white then the yeast mixed with the reserved sugar and stir well.
4. Let it stand for 24 hours then bottle.  CAUTION - Although I haven't made this myself I suspect that the fermentation will continue in the bottle.  This means that gas and pressure will build up.  Use bottles with corks instead of a fixed top.  That way if pressure builds up the cork will shoot out (releasing the gas and some of the ginger beer) and (hopefully) the bottle will not explode.  I have been caught out by exploding bottles of elderflower champage before and it isn't an experience I would recommend to others!  UPDATE - A correspondent has confirmed that you should put the ginger beer into bottles with corks release the pressure a few times and store them in a cool dark place with doors so that if a bottle explodes the resultant chaos will be confined.,

instructions, 1. Place the meat in a large saucepan of water and bring to the boil.
2. Bring to the boil. If a white scum (it’s salt) rises to the top drain off the water replace with cold water and bring to the boil again. Repeat until there is no scum. Then add the onions carrots and celery and simmer for 15 minutes per pound plus 15 minutes over.
3. Once the meat is cooked remove it from the water dry it lightly with some kitchen towels. Remove the thick fat layer unless you prefer it on throughout.  Retain a cupful of the cooking water – discard the vegetables they were there for flavor and have done their job.
4. Mix together the honey mustard and ground cloves and smear it all over the bacon. Leave it covered to ‘rest’ and let the honey mixture soak in for about 20-30 minutes – or several hours or even overnight if that suits you better.
5. Before serving put the bacon into a moderately hot oven about 400ºF (200ºC/Gas Mark 6) for about 20-30 minutes. This gives you plenty of time to prepare the cabbage.
6. CABBAGE:
7. Remove the outer leaves of the cabbage cut it into four and remove the stalk. Then finely shred it.
8. Put half a cupful of the bacon water in a saucepan add the butter and bring to the boil. Then add the cabbage and stir it constantly until it wilts and becomes slightly soft. It will take about 5 minutes to cook. The water and butter will disappear – partly coating the cabbage partly steaming away – so you will not need to drain it at all.,

instructions, 1. Dice bacon into small pieces and place in a large skillet over medium high heat to brown for 5 minutes.  I find that my wok also does a great job on this recipe.
2. Dice the onion and roughly chop up the cabbage while the bacon is browning.  Add onion and garlic and allow to brown with bacon for another minute.
3. There should be a couple tablespoons of bacon drippings in the bottom of the skillet but if it is the meatier high quality bacon add a tablespoon of vegetable oil as well and then add all the cabbage and seasonings.
4. Stir the cabbage in well so that it gets coated in the oil and then allow it to brown and cook down for about 20 minutes stirring again every few minutes so that it doesn't burn or scorch on the bottom.
5. No doubt the kitchen smells a bit more Irish now so serve and enjoy.,

Pour half of the pudding ontop of the cake pieces and smooth and even the top. Add the kiwi slices in even rows on top of the pudding. Pour about 1/2 of the tub of Cool Whip and smooth out on top. Sprinkle the Cool Whip with green colored sugar sprinkles.

(Gently press two fingers into dough. If indentation remains dough has risen enough.) Punch dough down; cover and let rest 5 minutes.
5. Divide in half. Working with one portion at a time (cover remaining dough to prevent drying) roll each portion into a 14 x 8-inch rectangle on a floured surface. Roll up each rectangle tightly starting with a short edge pressing firmly to eliminate air pockets; pinch seam and ends to seal. Place each loaf seam sides down in a 9-inch loaf pan coated with cooking spray. Cover and let rise 30 minutes or until doubled in size.

2. With both hands twist the two halves in opposite directions and pull apart.
3. Remove the pit with a knife or a spoon.
4. Carve out the flesh of the avocado with a tablespoon.

8. Add salt pepper tabasco sauce and lime juice and taste to see if seasoned enough to your liking.
9. In a separate small bowl put in 2 tablespoons of the dip.
10. Add 1 tbsp of sour cream and adjust your seasonings again.
11. Taste it and decide if you prefer your guacamole with or without sour cream.

instructions, 1. Make Recipe #387518 for the dough.
2. Prepare 2 large baking sheet pans with parchment or Silpats set aside.
3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
4. With lightly floured hands quickly shape dough into a ball by streching the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides rotating the ball a quarter turn as you go.
5. On a lightly floured board flatten the dough with hands and rolling pin into a 1/4 inch thick rectangle dusting with minimal flour if necessary to keep dough from sticking to the rolling pin. If difficulty is experienced in rolling out the dough allow it to rest for a few minutes. I've found that pulling the dough with my hands works best.
6. Spread the Thousand Island dressing on the dough then add corn beef sauerkraut and cheese leaving some of the cheese exposed so that it can help hold the roll together as it bakes.
7. Starting with the long end roll the dough into a log.
8. NOTE: Cut only the number of pieces you want to bake. The rest can be wropped and stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or can be frozen for up to 2 weeks.
9. Using kitchen shears cut the dough into 1/2 inch pieces.
10. Place them on the prepared sheet leaving plenty of space for them to expand when they bake.
11. Bake for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown and the cheese has melted and caramelized a bit.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 275°.
2. NOTE: 3/14 This will be salty. If you would like to reduce the saltiness of your corned beef before baking please follow this recipe recommendations recipe#361142.
3. NOTE: *If your corned beef does not include a flavor packet add 2 T peppercorns and 1/2 T coriander seeds to the dried seasonings listed above.
4. Combine the flavor packet with other dried ingredients. Using a spice grinder or a mortar and pestle grind to desired texture. I prefer medium or med-fine. Set aside.
5. Rinse corned beef brisket well with cold water. Pat dry.
6. Get out your 9 x 13 baking dish.
7. Tear off a large sheet of HEAVY aluminum foil enough to wrap  tent and enclose the corned beef.
8. Place the corned beef on the foil in a baking dish  fat side up.

12. After 2 hours wrap the brisket tightly and tenting the foil but sealing it for the remainder of the time an additional 2 hours.  Feel free to check and make sure there is moisture in the foil re-wrap and continue baking. Approximate baking time is 1 1/5 hours per pound. It may take longer depending on desired level of tenderness.
13. Bake to an internal temperature of 185°. Check for tenderness. Continue baking until the brisket is fork tender. It may take additional time depending on the thickness of the brisket.
14. Allow the meat to rest before slicing. Cut against the grain.
15. I prefer to use an electric knife to get nice thin slices.
16. Serve with horseradish a hearty rye bread Colleen's Colcanon potatoes and Irish Soda bread (see suggestions in the intro).

8. Fold the mixture into the egg whites.
9. When completely mixed pour into a very well greased 7 cup pudding basin or a bowl suitable for use on the stove.
10. If using the bowl construct a lid as follows: Cut a piece of wax paper large enough to cover the bowl with some excess for folding. Fold a one inch pleat in the middle of the wax paper. Do the same with a piece of aluminum foil. Cover the bowl with the wax paper then with the foil lining up the pleats. Secure with kitchen twine; cut off any excess.

13. Keep the water in the pot boiling for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. (You will need to add more boiling water from the kettle from time to time.).
14. The pudding will be firm and cakelike on top when it is finished. If you are not sure boil it longer it can't be overdone.
15. Once it is ready let it cool for a few minutes in the basin then turn it out on a plate.
16. You may serve it warm or let it "age" in an airtight container which will richen the flavor.,

instructions, 1. You will also need a good solid 7 inch (18 cm) or 8 inch (20 cm) frying pan some kitchen paper greaseproof paper a palette knife or flexible pan slice and a ladle.
2. Sift the flour and a pinch of salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the centre with the back of a spoon then break in the eggs and pour in half the milk. Whisk together gradually incorporating the flour to make a smooth thick batter. Beat thoroughly to remove any lumps then stir in the rest of the milk.
3. Pour the pancake batter into a jug or a bowl with a pouring lip.
4. Now get the pan really hot then turn the heat down to medium and to start with do a test pancake to see if you're using the correct amount of batter. (I find 2 tablespoons about right for a 7 inch (18 cm) pan and 3 tablespoons for an 8 inch (20 cm) pan.) Pancakes should always be cooked in butter.
5. Melt 2 oz of butter in a pan pour the excess in to a bowl; then add 2 tablespoons of the melted butter to the batter and whisk it inches.
6. Pour the batter into the pan tilting the pan as you pour until the batter thinly coats the base. Cook over a moderate heat for 30 seconds to one minute until golden brown on the underside.
7. Flip over the pancake with a palette knife and cook the other side until it is golden brown. Slide the pancake out of the pan on to a plate heat a little more oil or butter and cook the remaining pancakes one at a time in the same way.
8. If preparing in advance cook and stack the pancakes. Reheat in the microwave on Medium (750W) for about 2 minutes. Alternatively heat the oven to 180C/gas 4/fan 160°C Wrap the pancakes in foil and warm them through in the oven for 10 minutes.
9. TO SERVE.
10. To serve sprinkle each pancake with freshly squeezed lemon juice and caster sugar fold in half then in half again to form triangles or else simply roll them up into long tubes. Serve sprinkled with a little more sugar and lemon juice and extra wedges of lemon.
11. To FREEZE.
12. Pancakes freeze VERY well stacked as above then placed in freezer bags. If frozen it's best to defrost the pancakes before reheating.,

instructions, 1. The night before:
2. Scald the milk (i.e. heat it to just before boiling but do not let it boil) and remove from heat.
3. Add the oatmeal and the pinch of salt: stir cover and soak the oatmeal overnight in the milk.
4. The next day:
5. Reheat the oatmeal and milk mixture just until it boils. Simmer for another 3-4 minutes then remove from heat.
6. Pour the mixture into a bowl and add the beaten egg grated lemon rind and sugar to taste.
7. Dissolve the gelatine in the orange juice and water.
8. Add this to the mixture when it's cooled and then carefully fold in the whipped cream.
9. Pour the whole mixture into a single glass bowl or into individual parfait glasses and leave to set. (You may want to stir the contents gently once or twice while they're setting to keep the oats from sinking to the bottom.).
10. Serve with more whipped cream and 3-4 tablespoons of your chosen fruit sauce on top.
11. Another more parfait-like approach to this dessert: allow the whole recipe's worth of oatmeal cream to set in a single bowl. Stir gently as above so that the oatmeal is evenly distributed through the mixture when it's set. Then spoon it into parfait glasses alternating layers of oatmeal cream with more whipped cream and drizzles of fruit sauce.
12. If you want to cut back on the calories a little you could also substitute creme fraiche or beaten low-fat sour cream for the whipped cream.,

5. This is the time to add cooked mini-ears of corn drizzle with the juices and cover and simmer for another 15 minutes. Sometimes I do not use the corn  (your choice.)  The cooked corn goes well as a side.
6. The amount of pork you use determines the amount of kraut and potatoes you should use I like lots of pork and like lots of kraut.  Nothing worse than everyone loving it and not having enough pork or kraut.
7. Hope you enjoy this recipe tell me about your experience with it.,

instructions, 1. Remove the membrane (stomach lining) from the ribs and cut off excessive fat. Rinse under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. Season the ribs with garlic powder salt and pepper and place on a rack in a baking pan. Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 40 minutes or till the ribs are nicely browned.
2. Meanwhile slice the kielbasa into 3” pieces then slice each piece lengthwise. Or cut the bratwursts in half crosswise then slice them lengthwise. Spray a large skillet with vegetable oil and brown the cut side of the meat slices in a skillet over medium heat till lightly browned. Remove the meat from the skillet and set the meat aside on a plate.
3. When the ribs are done cut into single rib portions and place into an 8 quart stockpot. Add the peppercorns and the ribs to the pot.
4. Cut off any fat from the smoked pork chops and place into the stockpot.
5. Add the bay leaf and the peppercorns to the stockpot. Add the prepared kielbasa or bratwurst un-drained sauerkraut and water to the stockpot. Bring to a boil lower the heat to low cover and simmer for about 1 hour. Remove the bay leaf and the peppercorns from the pot and discard them before serving the pork & kraut.
6. Meanwhile peel the potatoes and boil in salted water till fork tender.
7. Cut the meat from the smoked pork chops cut the meat into bite sized pieces return the meat to the pot and reserve the bones for making pork stock in the future.
8. Serve with boiled potatoes. My Deutsche family smashes the potatoes on one side of their plates with a fork then they smear some butter over the potatoes. Follow with topping the potatoes with some kraut and kraut juice and placing some meat on the vacant side of their plates. Refrigerate any leftover pork and kraut in a sealable plastic storage bag. Reserve and refrigerate any leftover potatoes in a sealable plastic storage bag for making potato pancakes.
9. Guten Appetit.,

instructions, 1. Sift flour into a large bowl make a well in the middle and crumble the yeast into it.
2. Dissolve 1 tablespoon caster sugar in lukewarm milk. Pour over yeast and mix with yeast and some of the flour. This first yeast-mixture should be still fluid. Cover and let rise in warm place for 20 minutes.
3. Meanwhile: Mix all other ingredients for the buns until smooth.
4. Add this mixture to the yeast and flour. Mix first with a spoon.
5. Then knead with floured hands until dough is peeling away from the side of the bowl and blistering. This step may take 10 minutes (or more). Use some additional flour if dough is too sticky. At the end you should have a smooth dough. See note.
6. Cover and let rise in warm place for about 30 to 40 minutes or until dough has doubled.
7. Line out baking tray with parchment paper. Preheat oven (390°F 200°C).
8. After dough has doubled knead again a few times. Roll out on a floured workspace. About 1/2 inch thick.
9. Cut out circles of about 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Place the buns on baking tray. Let rise again for 15 minutes.
10. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the top of the buns are slightly golden.
11. Take out and let cool completely.
12. NOTE on baker's yeast: also called cake yeast. It is the yeast sold as a solid block. You could replace it by dry yeast. If you use dry yeast dissolve the dry yeast in lukewarm water prior adding it to the flour. Use as much dry yeast as you would need for 3 cups flour.
13. NOTE on cream goat cheese: I like the taste of goat cheese here but you could replace it by any other cream cheese of your choice.
14. NOTE on dough: You could also use the dough hook of your food processor to knead the dough. But I prefer to do it by hand and I always have the feeling that the texture of a hand kneaded dough is different.,

instructions, 1. Mixing and Storing the Dough: Note: If measuring flour rather than weighing don't press down into the flour as you scoop it in with dry-ingredient measuring cups  By gently scooping up flour then sweeping the top level with a knife or spatula.you willl get a more accurate measurement.
2. In large plastic storage container (with lid) mix together the flours yeast cocoa and salt.
3. Mix together water coffee and molasses. Add the water mixture at once and mix with a wooden spoon.
4. If mixing becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with the spoon reach into the mixing bowl with very wet hands and press the mixture together. Note: kneading isn't necessary.
5. When everything is uniformly moist without dry patches your mixing is complete.  This should take only a few minutes. The dough will be wet and loose enough to conform to the shape of its container.
6. Cover with a lid (not airtight) that fits well on the container.  Allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse or at least flattens on the top about 2 hours depending on the room's temperature and the initial water temperature. Longer rising times up to about 5 hours will not harm the result.
7. You can use a portion of the dough anytime after this period. Fully refrigerated wet dough is less sticky and easier to work with than dough at room temperature. So the first time you try this method it's best to refrigerate the dough overnight or at least 3 hours before shaping a loaf.
8. The breads flavor improves with the retardation so suggest you wait at least 24 hours before baking the first loaf!   Dough may be stored in the refrigerator for up to  8 days.
9. BAKING (One 1-pouond loaf): With wet hands pull up one end of the refrigerated dough. Using a serrated knife cut off a 1-pound or grapefruit-size piece of dough.
10. Without using flour shape into a ball by stretching the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all sides rotating the ball a quarter-turn as you go. Form into an oval-shaped loaf.
11. Place on a pizza peel dusted with cornmeal (or on parchment paper); allow to rest for  40 minutes - 1 1/2 hours varies with temperature of the kitchen.  (The shorter the time the denser the crumb.).
12. Twenty minute before baking  place an empty cast-iron skillet or broiler tray on the bottom shelf and baking stone on center shelf; preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
13. Using a pastry brush paint the top of the loaf with cornstarch wash and sprinkle with caraway seeds. With a serrated bread knife slash the top of the loaf with deep diagonal cuts. Slide the loaf directly onto the hot stone.  Pour 1 cup of hot tap water into the broiler tray and quickly close the oven door.
14. Bake for about 35 - 40 minutes or until firm (interior temperature should be 198 - 200 degrees).  Note: Larger or smaller loaves will require an adjustment to the baking time. Allow to cool on a rack before cutting.,

3. Cover the dish and marinate for at least 3 hours or up to 6 hours.  I don't recommend to marinate over night because the onions will turn bitter.
4. Fire up the grill and when it has its cooking temperature remove the marinade from the meat and grill to desired doneness.
5. If you go with pork tenderloin make sure you don't overcook the meat.  Take it off the grill when it is still flexible when you press on it with your finger.  Place it in an oven dish cover it and let it rest in the oven at about 200 degrees for 10 minutes.  This gives the juices a chance to settle and the meat will be soooo tender.,

Fold the other half over into a half moon shape then press the edges together with fingers or lightly with a fork. Boil the wareneki for about ten minutes - they will float when cooked. Serve with gravy or butter or after they're boiled you can fry the wareneki with onions and bacon and serve with sour cream (I like mine with ketchup).,

3. Add the prawns to the stock and simmer until they turn pink (approximately 2 to 3 minutes). Remove the prawns and save the stock.
4. Place the fish in a shallow ovenproof dish. Arrange the prawns and the asparagus tips on top.
5. Make a roux by melting the butter and adding the flour to it. Cook it for 4 to 5 minutes. Heat 2 cups of the fish stock and gradually add it to the roux. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes until the sauce is smooth and thick.
6. Beat the sour cream and the egg yolk together add some of the hot sauce and then in turn pour the cream and yolk mixture back into the sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
7. Pour the sauce over the fish in the ovenproof dish.
8. FOR THE PASTRY: Preheat the oven to 375 F (190 C/Gas 5).
9. Combine the flour and the salt. Chop the butter into small pieces and mix it with the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the egg and lemon peel and with the minimum of kneading prepare the dough.
10. Roll it out to the size of the ovenproof dish and lay it over the seafood mixture.
11. Brush the egg and water mixture over the pastry and bake the pie in the oven until the pastry is golden-brown and crisp.
12. Serves 6-8.
