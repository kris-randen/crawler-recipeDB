instructions, 1. Rice stuffing mixture:
2. On top of stove put a good amount oil or butter; add chopped onion and pureed onion sauté. Add garlic when onions almost finished not to burn.
3. Add a spoon of tomato paste and stir around until all coated.
4. Add pureed tomato a few drops of water and cook until liquid is almost gone. It should be a little thick not too watery. You can add some salt to taste to this too.
5. Set aside.
6. Put washed rice in mixing bowl. Add the above tomato mixture. Add raw chopped greens- parsley dill and cilantro. Its okay to chop some of their stems gives the mixture more flavor. Add a little canola oil.
7. Add all spices and dry mint. Take 1 chicken bouillon cube and crush it add to rice.
8. Mix all ingredients until well blended set aside. Try to taste will be raw I know but you can taste and not swallow rice. Adjust seasonings. Salt is most important if too salty don’t worry once cooked it will lessen.
9. Cooking Cabbage:
10. This is the trickiest part. I have not yet found the perfect way but my way has been working alright…here it goes.
11. Wash the head of cabbage well. With a paring knife gently cut around core loosening it a bit. Try to cup deep but try not to cut leaves or separate at this point.
12. Using a large pot fill with water and a few dashes of cumin. Once boiling add the head of cabbage with core facing up.
13. As the cabbage starts to cook with a knife gently pull away leaves from core and cook until a bit soft but not translucent.
14. So you will have the large head of cabbage in pot and you will be cutting leaves and letting them boil alone aside the head. (Hope this makes sense.).
15. When the leaves are a bit soft tender not translucent remove to a large tray.
16. Continue this until all cabbage is cooked.
17. You will have the very small leaves towards inside core you will be able to use some of these but some maybe too small. I usually make a cabbage salad with these.
18. Once the leaves are cool you will begin to stuff.
19. Rolling/stuffing the cabbage:
20. Prepare a large pot put some oil in bottom of pot to coat.
21. Slice 1 large tomato thinly and place on bottom of pot. You will arrange cabbage in this pot as you roll.
22. Take a cabbage leaf and cut from the bottom where core starts.
23. Cut away the hard core and reserve the two sides from leaf making a pile.
24. Save a few of the cores stems as well.
25. Tricky but you are trying to get a pliable leaf for rolling.
26. You want to make the leaf small cutting a half of the leaf in half. The end result should be size of small cigar.
27. Don't worry about how they look they will not be real tight and they may seem like the rice will come out just close as best you can they will be fine.
28. So with leaf laying flat spoon a small amount of rice onto leaf fold up bottom and roll like a cigar. Don't worry the ends will be open but cook ok. Some rice may boil out but not much trust me.
29. Roll all until leaves are finished.
30. Once all rolled and arranged in pot add a crushed chicken bouillon cube. As you are arranging in pot you can put a few of the core stems in between layers to help stay in place.
31. Take approximately 3 cups water and mix with tomato paste pour over cabbage. Water should reach just above cabbage. If not enough add more water.
32. Take an old plate invert it over cabbage to keep from moving too much.
33. Put on high bring to a boil cook for about 10 minutes then turn to a lower simmer and cover.
34. Should cook for approximately an hour or so you can check it periodically by tasting to see if rice is cooked inside.
35. Once cooked let sit for a little to cool a bit before removing from pot.
36. When ready to remove take a large serving platter put over top of pot then flip pot to empty onto platter. Be careful and do over sink if you are unsure. Its easy but take s a little practice.
37. Remove core stems fix tomatoes that are on top to look presentable.
38. *** LEFTOVER TIP: THE NEXT DAY PREPARE THE LEFTOVERS THIS WAY -- PUT SOME BUTTER INTO A PAN FRY THE STUFFED CABBAGE LEAVES UNTIL GOLDEN BROWN ON ALL SIDES. SUPER TASTY ENJOY! ***.,

7. Notes: What I have referred to in the ingredients as 4 small pizza crusts were in the original recipe listed as 4 small individual pizza bases but this term was not Zaar-friendly. In Australia you can buy pizza crusts or bases in several sizes in supermarkets.  I'm sure they are also available elsewhere but perhaps called something different.

5. When the meringue is thick and glossy fold in the lavender flowers.
6. Carefully spoon the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a 5mm (1/4") round tip. If you don't have a pastry bag cut a small corner off a ziploc baggie to use instead.
7. Pipe as many little meringue buttons onto the baking sheet as you can. Bake at the bottom of the oven for 1.5-2 hours.
8. When ready segment the oranges by using a serrated knife to remove the peel from the all around the oranges.

2. Add 1 tsp Vanilla Extract.
3. In a separate bowl whisk Corn Starch with 1 cup of Coconut milk and 1 cup of Mango Juice to incorporate. Then add it slowly to Sugar-milk mixture while stirring quickly until it starts to thicken. I like to keep the heat on medium and just be patient for it to thicken rather than turn up the heat and burn the cornstarch.
4. * It is very very important to whisk quickly and scrape the bottom of the pot with the whisk to make sure the cornstarch isn't sticking.
5. At this time you can add Mango pieces fresh or frozen and let them break down into the custard.
6. Turn heat down to low. Cook for 5 minutes.
7. Take mixture off heat and wait until the temperature goes down a little.
8. You’re almost done. Pour the Mehalabeya into individual dessert dishes.
9. Let cool on counter then top with Toasted Coconut and wrap each dish with saran wrap and place in fridge to chill and firm up.
10. * Serve with more fresh Mango if you like.

instructions, 1. Marinate the steaks overnight in olive oil sea salt and fresh cracked pepper.
2. You can utilize any fresh herbs you have in your garden or local market such as rosemary.
3. Take the steaks out and let them rest about an hour before you start to work with them.
4. In the meantime fire up the oven to 350 degrees F.
5. Take your garlic bulbs and slice them in half diagonally.
6. Season with olive oil and sea salt.
7. Roast on a pan in the oven for about 15 minutes or until the garlic is nice and golden brown and your house smells heavenly.
8. Take out and set aside.
9. Heat your saute pan with some olive oil and throw in about 6 cloves of fresh chopped garlic when hot.
10. Add spinach and saute until spinach is just wilted.
11. Season with salt and pepper.
12. Chop up the sun-dried tomatoes and toss with the spinach.
13. When the spinach has cooled throw in the brie and the roasted garlic.
14. You can easily pull the roasted garlic from the'husk' by using a toothpick to pull it out.
15. Mix together very well!
16. Season with salt and pepper.
17. You can also throw in a teaspoon or so of fresh rosemary at this point.
18. Set aside.
19. Take your steaks and cut a slit into the side of them just as you would with stuffing pork chops.
20. Carefully stuff the steaks with your roasted garlic stuffing.
21. Throw those guys on the BBQ for about 3-4 minutes per side pending your guests preference.
22. I serve these steaks over garlic mashers which I usually just throw in an extra bulb of garlic to roast when making the stuffing and mash it all up with some fresh potatoes butter and cream.
23. A little parsley to garnish.
24. For the sauce take 4 tablespoons of butter and melt in a saucepan over low heat.
25. Add about 6 cloves of fresh chopped garlic 1/4 cup of cream and 4 tablespoons of good quality balsamic vinegar.
26. Throw in a sprig of fresh rosemary and reduce the sauce by about 1/3.
27. Take out the rosemary.
28. To plate place lean against a heap of the garlic mashers and drizzle the sauce around the plate and over the potatoes.
29. Garnish with fresh rosemary.
30. It is excellent to have a nice fresh loaf of bread to serve with this.

3. Makes about 3 cups.
4. fresh white meat of 1 coconut
5. Grate the meat by hand or process it in a blender. To extract the flavorful moisture from the gratings it is easy to mimic the Africans' method of using a conical woven basket. Line a bowl with a cotton cloth such as cheesecloth making sure that the lining is big enough to drape over the sides of the bowl. Dump the grated coconut onto the cloth and then pour 1 cup of boiling water over it. When it is cool enough to handle gather the edges of the cloth and lift it above the bowl. Wring it with both hands to squeeze out the mlky liquid which you should pour off and save. Repeat this process three times.
6. The first squeezing is the most concentrated so you should keep each squeezing separate and use them in order (i.e. use the first squeezing as the first cup in a recipe etc.).,

instructions, 1. Method For the Khobz (bread):
2. Put the semolina and flour in a very large but shallow bowl - a gas'a if you have one is best. Make a well in the centre and add 1/2 a glass of water. Mix enough water to create a workable dough then begin kneading. Do this (until your hands hurt! ) until the dough becomes very smooth and elastic - you can put this dough in the bread maker on dough setting to make things easier if you like. Once the dough has reached elastic stage leave it to stand for 5 minutes.
3. Take sunflower/vegetable oil etc and lightly coat work surfaces then pull off pieces of dough and form balls slightly larger than a golf ball.
4. Gently stretch these balls over the m'ri or pan and cook (approx 30 seconds). Keep the cooked bread covered with cloth or towel so it doesn't dry up and finish cooking the rest.
5. You can start tearing the bread straight away or leave it until you are finished if you are alone (I say this because it is best done with 2 people - one cooking one tearing!) Depending on your personal preference/which side of Algeria you come from you'll decide whether to tear it into smaller or larger pieces --.
6. Method for the Marga (sauce):
7. Finely chop the onion and garlic and place it in a large heavy bottomed pan with the meat or chicken and ras el hanout. Fry gently to seal the meat/chicken. I use my pressure cooker for this.
8. Chop the carrot parsnip & courgette into 6ths. Cut the potato into 1/4's and roughly chop the swede. (Peel the carrots potatoes parsnip & swede).
9. Add the vegetables to the meat along with 1L of water and turn up heat so they begin simmering. If using the chilli add it now along with salt & pepper. If cooking in a regular pan then cook for 40 minutes like this. If using the pressure cooker as I do then 20 minutes will be enough.
10. Add the tomatoes chick peas and dried mint and 1/2L more water or enough to create a 'stew' consistency.
11. Return to heat and cook in pan for further 30 minutes and if using pressure cooker then cook on med to high for a further 25 minutes.
12. Finally place the Khobz in a a gas'a or very large dish (or individually if preferred) and pour over the Marga (sauce) arranging the meat so that everyone has a piece.,

3. Oil a griddle or heavy frying pan and heat over a medium heat.
4. Pour about 3 tbsp of batter into the pan rotating the pan so the batter flows evenly over the surface. Cook until bubbles appear and burst on the surface and the underside is light golden brown.

6. Arrange the crepes in an overlapping circle around the plate rather than stacking them as this makes them tough.

Stir in the garlic oregano cinnamon and cayenne and cook until fragrant about 30 seconds. Stir in the tomatoes 3/4 cup of the cheese nuts and vinegar and cook until warmed through about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside.

Using two forks gently push the flesh to the sides of each eggplant half to make room for the filling. Mound about 1/4 cup of the filling into each eggplant. (At this point the eggplants can be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours.).
5. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup cheese and bake on the upper-middle rack until the cheese is melted 5 to 10 minutes. (If refrigerated increase the baking time to 8 to 12 minutes.) Sprinkle with the parsley and serve warm or at room temperature.,

instructions, 1. Place condensed milk in a mixing bowl and add lemon juice 5ml at a time while mixing thoroughly. Taste after every 5ml and add to suit your taste. Lemon juice will curdle the condensed milk and it will finally turn lighter in colour and change the texture. Be sure to end with a fairly tart (tangy) mixture to offset the sweetness of the custard. Must be pleasant to eat on it's own though --  Put aside but do not refrigerate.
2. Make approximately 500 ml of Custard.
3. Place one layer of Tennis biscuits on the bottom of a 20 x 30 glass or ceramic fridge/oven dish. Spread a layer of Custard (approximately 1cm) over the biscuits without disturbing them but covering them. Place another layer of biscuits over the custard. Now spread a layer of the lemony condensed milk over the biscuits (approximately 5-6 mm). Repeat until you run out of ingredients or you reach the top of the dish.
4. Leave one biscuit for the end to crush and sprinkle over the top. You can decorate the top with other sprinkles but biscuit crumbles are the original. Refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours but cover with tin foil to keep fridge flavours out. Cut in square portions and serve.
5. This is the original South African Fridge Tart!,

4. Place the chicken in a single layer over the onions.  Sprinkle with the reserved lemon zest and place at least one lemon slice on top of each piece of chicken.  Sprinkle the raisins on top.  If desired add a dash of lemon juice.
5. Microwave a bowl of water for a few minutes until boiling or nearly boiling.  Add enough of the water to the pan until it just covers the chicken.  Raise heat to medium-high and cover tightly with a lid.  Boil gently for 30 minutes.

instructions, 1. For the filling:
2. Combine the dates and orange zest cinnamon and orange blossom water in a food processor and process to a paste. Add olive oil to create a smoother paste if desired.  If your dates are hard your food processor might not be able to grind them so splash a small amount of water on them and heat them in the microwave to soften before processing.
3. For the breads:
4. Combine flours and salt in large bowl. Add the oil a little at a time kneading as you go add enough water (start with just a few tablespoons!) to achieve a soft dough.
5. Divide into quarters and knead each quarter on a work surface. Pat a quarter into a 6 inch round. (The dough may tear keep pressing it together).
6. Cover with date filling leaving about 1/4 inch around the edge and pat another quarter into a 6 inch round and put this on top of the date filling. Press together seal the edges and shape into a neat circle. Cut into 8 wedges — like a pizza. Repeat with remaining dough.
7. Heat cast iron skillet until quite hot. Add as many pieces as will fit without crowding. Cook turning once or twice until browned on both sides and the dough is cooked through (i.e. does not look raw). I start the pan on high and I found it useful to turn down the heat after adding the wedges so that I did not burn them before the dough could cook.,

2. In a saute pan start onions on a low flame in a little olive oil and salt and pepper. You want them to caramelize nicely without burning.
3. Place eggplant slices in large bowl and drizzle liberally with olive oil season with salt and pepper and give a good toss (trick: works well in clean plastic bag such as [gasp] a trash bag. Just pull out the slices for roasting and toss the bag.).
4. Place seasoned eggplant on baking sheets in single layer and roast until tender about 15 minutes.
5. When onions are near done add the garlic.
6. In food processor add all of the ingredients and pulse a couple times.
7. Taste to adjust seasoning then pulse to desired consistency (I like it a little chunky so I know I'm eating eggplant). You may adjust consistency by drizzling in olive oil while pulsing.
8. Very good with crusty bread or pita or crackers or to stuff roasted tomatoes. Enjoy.,

instructions, 1. In a medium bowl dissolve the yeast in the water.  Add the flour and salt and stir well.  Let stand loosely covered to ferment for 45 minutes.
2. Meanwhile prepare the filling:  Mix the ingredients in a bowl until you have a homogeneous mass.  Set aside.
3. When ready to proceed heat a small heavy skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes.  Lightly brush the skillet with butter.  Stir the batter well to blend.  Scoop up about 2 1/2 Tablespoons batter and pour onto the skillet to make a 4-inch round or an oval about 4 inches long.  Cook until bubbles appear on the top and the top has a matte dull surface about 1 minute and 20 seconds.  The underside will be just touched with the palest brown.  Transfer to a plate cooked side down.
4. Scoop up 1 teaspoon filling and squeeze it in your hand into a firm oblong then place it on the cooked pancake.  Immediately fold the pancake over and pinch the edges together to make a sealed half moon shape.  (The trick with atayef is to fill them while the top of the pancake is still warm so the edges stick together well.)  Set aside on a plate and repeat with the remaining batter and filling.  (Once you get comfortable with the sequence of steps you may want to have two skillets going at once to speed production.  But even with only one person and one skillet you can get all the atayef made in a short time.).
5. The filled pancakes can sit loosely covered for up to 3 hours before being fried.
6. When ready to proceed pour about 1 inch of peanut or vegetable oil into a deep fryer or stable wok or other deep frying arrangement and heat to 375°F  Use a thermometer to check or the following test:  Stick a chopstick vertically into the hot oil.  If bubbles come rising up beside it the oil is hot enough.  Have a slotted spoon by your stove top as well as two paper towel-lined plates.
7. Slide the first half moon into the hot oil.  It should bubble a little.  Then slide in another and another.  Each should cook for about 30 seconds until lightly browned; turn each over in the oil after about 15 seconds.  With the slotted spoon transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.  Fry the remaining half moons in the same manner.  Serve hot or warm with tea or coffee.  Makes 12 to 15 half moon shaped pancakes.
8. NOTE:  Kanefa and haloumi is available in specialty stores and great for stuffing  pancakes.  Ricotta salata is like feta however and is made from fresh ricotta that has been salted and dried.  It is available in supermarkets.

I use either a tall 5" round tin or a shallow 12" round tin (if having a plain- unfilled but iced cake) - both work very well & I've also seen others using square pans & bundt tins --  Bake in a preheated oven at 180C for 40-45 minutes; test to see if it is done - it may need a few extra minutes. If cooked turn off oven & allow cake to rest in it for around 3 minutes.
3. Filling:
4. Beat the margarine / butter until creamy. Slowly add enough icing sugar to reach a consistency you like. Tint yellow if desired. When the cake has cooled completely use a bread knife to cut the cake into 3 layers. Divide the filling in half & spread onto bottom & middle layers using a pallet knife or similar.
5. Icing.
6. After filling the cake put the top layer back in place. Trim off any edges or bumps etc. Mix the sifted icing sugar with the lemon juice & enough water to get a very thick but spoonable consistency. Tint with colouring if desired & carefully spoon over the top of the cake. The icing will slowly begin to drip down the sides of the cake - take a pallet knife & carefully run it around the sides of the cake to ensure & even covering.
7. When the icing is almost set run a clean damp finger or knife handle around the rim of the plate (if serving on it) & top with chocolate mini eggs or other decorations of your choice.,

2. Brown one side (about two-three minutes) then turn each slice and brown the other side. Remove from pan and place on a paper towel to absorb the excess oil. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt.
3. In the same pan pour one can of Mango nectar and simmer on medium low heat until reduced and thickened about 5 minutes or more depending on the thickness of your canned nectar.
4. Meanwhile peel the mangoes and cut into one-inch chunks. I like to make a circular cut around the mango top to bottom following the edge of the mango seed. Then cut one-inch slices across the grain on both flat sides of the seed. With a long knife cut your chunks away from the seed. (Everyone has their own way of cutting up a mango.).
5. Add shrimp to the mango reduction and simmer until they turn pink and opaque.
6. A good way to test a reduction sauce is to pull a flat edged spatula across the pan. If the sauce holds back for an instant as shown here you have a nice not-too-thick-not-too-thin reduction.
7. Set the shrimp and sauce aside in a bowl to cool down a bit.
8. Then carefully fold in your mango plantains and cilantro. This is a very easy fruity dish that can be served as a light lunch or an appetizer.,

name, Lemon Infused Honey(With Variations), 
cuisine, African >> Rest Africa >> Nigerian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Lemon Honey:
2. Pour 1 cup of honey into your pan and add 1 tablespoon of freshly grated lemon peel. Toss in 2 slices for boosted flavor if you like. Heat these together for about 10 minutes making sure to keep the heat relatively low. Burned honey doesn’t taste as bad as some other things do burned but you still want to avoid it. Around 115 degrees Fahrenheit releases the flavors nicely but it will depend on your stovetop. After you’ve heated the mixture let it sit for 1-2 hours or up to 1-2 weeks. After its infused strain if you’d like and place in a glass jar with a tightly fitting top. Know the longer it sits for the stronger it will taste.
3. Good to use: If you have a bad cough or cold place a healthy dollop of your lemon infused honey at the bottom of a cup. Pour freshly boiled water over the top drop in a teabag and give it a good stir. The lemon can loosen phlegm while the honey soothes irritation. You can also slowly heat the lemon infused honey while adding the juice of one freshly squeezed lemon. When it’s still hot and liquid sip slowly.
4. Cinnamon Honey:
5. Pour 1 cup of honey into the saucepan and drop in the cinnamon sticks. Push them down with a spoon to submerge them. For 10 minutes on low heat let the mixture heat up and then let it sit for around 2 hours or up to 1-2 weeks. Strain if you’d like and store in glass jar.
6. Good if used: In tea just like the lemon-honey or eaten straight off the spoon. It’s also delicious spread on a plain piece of toast. Cinnamon is chock full of anti-oxidants possesses antifungal properties and helps break up congestions/clear the sinuses. Even just a half a teaspoon a day has been shown to lower cholesterol levels.
7. Ginger Honey:
8. Pour 1 cup of honey into a saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of finely chopped gingerroot. You can add a small pinch of ground ginger if you’d like as well but it does have a strong flavor. On low heat let the mixture sit for 10 minutes. When it’s done let it infuse for 2 hours or up to 2 weeks in a glass jar with a tightly fitting lid. Strain when it’s finished if you’d like.
9. Best used: In your tea when you’re feeling ill-especially with an upset tummy since both ginger and honey are known to soothe your stomach and chase off “bugs.” The added ginger helps circulation flushing toxins through your systems and helping get rid of aches and chills. If you’re in a pinch and have wound up with a minor abrasion applying this cooled and then covering with gauze can help it heal  and the ginger fights inflammation.
10. Not to be confused with clover honey clove honey is made by infusing whole cloves with honey whereas clover honey is made from the nectar of clover flowers. Cloves are great at numbing pain (sore throats toothaches etc.) and the honey makes a happy healthy medium to ingest it with.
11. Pour 1 cup of honey into a saucepan and then add 5-10 whole cloves. On low heat for 10 minutes before letting it infuse for 2 hours or up to 2 weeks  putting it in a jar with a tightly fitting lid. Strain when it’s finished if you’d like.
12. Best used: In tea when you have a sore throat or a toothache or dabbed directly on the gum by a sore tooth. The eugenol in the clove is a powerful numbing agent that was used by dentists before modern painkillers were created and is so effective it is still used in modern dentistry in an extracted form. If you have a little cut or sore in your mouth the honey may help it heal faster and keep bad bacteria out while the cloves take care of the discomfort.
13. Apple Cider Vinegar Honey:
14. Add 1 cup of honey to a saucepan and then pour in 2-3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. Let it heat over low heat for 10 minutes stirring well about halfway through. Place in a jar and let it sit for as long as you like-its taste and benefits are all there pretty quickly and it doesn’t need to sit as long as something like cinnamon sticks or cloves would.
15. Best:If you make the Braggs apple cider vinegar health drink you can try adding this for an extra kick. While this is subject to opinion I think it tastes good stirred in to tea or a glass of lemon water in the morning. Apple cider vinegar can help neutralize and correct excess acidity in our bodies (counterintuitive but often times true) and helps a number of issues from an upset stomach to easing sore throats to showing promise in treating diabetes.
16. Storage:
17. The shelf-life if stored in a glass jar with a tightly fitting lid is 6 months. Some people say it can last years but I have never experimented with that. Even with plant matter it can go a long time (microorganisms have a hard time surviving on/in it) without needing to be refrigerated. Simply store in a cool place away from direct sunlight. Straining is more for looks/taste and is easiest when the honey has been warmed slightly after sitting for a few hours so it is runnier. If you want to let it infuse for longer than several hours pour it into your jar so it’s not sitting out in the open for a super long time. When it’s infused enough simply re-heat before straining by placing the jar in warm water if you’d like.
18. Tips:
19. -If crystals form set the honey (in its jar) in a pot of gently simmered water. The crystals will “melt” and your honey will be smooth again.
20. -A nice touch for flavor is to add 3 tablespoons of diced or roughly chopped fruit. Apple-strawberry is one of my favorite flavors for eating on toast with butter. I don’t strain it at the end either.
21. -Flavored honey makes an awesome gift in a nice decorative jar and you can actually get “honeystix” at many craft/party stores.
22. -Freely adjust to taste and experiment. It’s not an exact science and it’s all about what you like and what’s good for you.,

instructions, 1. This recipe needs to be started the day before.
2. Scrub and finely slice the lemons and/or limes.
3. Layer the fruits and salt in a non-metallic colander or sieve.  Cover with a non-metallic cover (not touching the fruits) and leave in a cool place for 24hrs.
4. Before preparing the pickle wash and sterilize the jars. Do this by filling them with boiling water and putting the lids in a separate small bowl of boiling water.  Pour away the water just before filling each jar and once the jar is full immediately take the lid from the bowl and without touching the inside screw it onto the jar.  Although the contents for the jars in this recipe are not heated the hot lid should contract and form a seal: if re-using a jam jar with a ‘pop in/out indicator’ on top this may well contract.  However the seal cannot be guaranteed so it is best to make occasional small quantities rather than one large batch.
5. Do not rinse the fruit.  Layer in sterilized jars sprinkling paprika between the layers.
6. Mix together the sugar oil and vinegar. Pour this mixture (unheated) over the fruit.  Seal the jars. (See note above at 3.).
7. The jar should regularly be gently shaken to mix together the oil and vinegar.  Allow to mature for a few days and ideally up to three weeks before using.  Store in a refrigerator once open.,

cuisine, African >> Rest Africa >> Nigerian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Dissolve the yeast in a little of the warm milk and set aside.
2. In a large mixing bowl combine the flour sugar salt and anise seeds. Add the eggs the butter the oil the orange flower water the yeast and the rest of the milk. Mix to form a very soft sticky dough.
3. If you find the dough is too sticky to handle add the smallest amount of flour necessary to be able to knead the dough.
4. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface (or in a stand mixer with a dough hook) for about 10 minutes or until very smooth. (It's desirable to have the dough somewhat sticky; you'll find that it becomes much easier to handle after its first rising.).
5. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl and turn the dough over once to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with a towel and leave the dough to rise until doubled – usually this takes about one to one-and-a-half hours but leave the dough to rise longer if necessary.
6. After the dough has risen divide it into 12 to 15 smooth evenly shaped balls. Place the balls of dough two inches apart on an oiled baking sheet and slightly flatten the tops of the dough.
7. Cover the baking sheet with a towel and leave the dough to rise another hour or longer or until the rolls are very light and puffy.
8. Preheat an oven to 450° F (230° C). Brush the tops and sides of the rolls with the egg wash and sprinkle the rolls with sesame seeds.
9. Bake the krachel for about 20 minutes or until rich golden brown. Transfer the rolls to a rack to cool.
10. TIPS & STORAGE:
11. Be sure that the milk is warm to the touch but not hot. Hot liquids will kill yeast while cool liquids will not activate it.
12. Be patient with the initial rising time; the dough is quite rich and may take awhile to rise properly.
13. Rotating the tray from front to back halfway through baking will help ensure even browning.
14. If the rolls aren't well-browned after 20 minutes of baking place them under a broiler for a minute. Watch the rolls carefully or they'll burn!
15. Krachel store well in plastic storage bags in the freezer. They can be warmed in the microwave directly from the freezer without drying out. The trick is to avoid making the rolls too hot.
16. If reheating krachel in an oven enclose the rolls in foil to keep them from becoming hard and dry.
17. LIGHTER DOUGH:
18. To make a lighter less-rich sweet dough for the krachel eliminate the vegetable oil and reduce the butter to 5 tablespoons. Adjust the amount of liquid if necessary to form a soft slightly sticky dough.,

instructions, 1. POSTSCRIPT actually: I have had complaints that the cake sticks. Point taken -- but it should be clear that the tin should really be well prepared. The best tin for this is the loose-bottomed kind. Cut a round of nonstick baking paper LARGER than the bottom of the cake tin grease tin well with butter (not marge which sticks) lay the round over it and press the excess paper up against the (greased) tin. This will prevent the oily liquid from the choccie layer escaping while baking. Grease the bottom paper again. Grease the sides and best cover that with nonstick paper as well and grease again. This preparation is a bit of a pain and I've had no trouble with this cake sticking but it's obvious one does have to prepare the tin well. Put the cake on a smallish cookie tin -- in case some of the topping does escape. You don't want a mess in your oven.
2. Preheat oven to 180 deg C/350 deg F. Grease a cake tin of 24 cm in diameter with butter. Line with baking paper and grease the paper with butter as well.
3. Break up the chocolate bar and melt in a pot with the tin of sweetened condensed milk over medium heat stirring until smooth. Scrape out into the prepared greased tin and tilt until this mixture is level. Put into your freezer making sure that the tin is standing level. Don't freeze! You only want to firm it up.
4. Next cream the butter and sugar (you can add a squirt of lemon juice to speed up the process).
5. Beat the eggs and vanilla in another small bowl.
6. Add to the butter-sugar mixture and beat well together.
7. Add the dry ingredients and the buttermilk and mix well.
8. Ladle the batter carefully over the hardened chocolate-condensed milk layer and level the batter.
9. Bake for about 1 hour or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.
10. Leave to cool in the pan for about 30 mins. and then invert on to a cake plate.
11. Remove the baking paper carefully. The topping might have made little air holes which is normal and can be disguised if you prefer.
12. If you want to decorate with fresh garden mint and sour cherries OR sift confectioner's sugar over one half and cocoa powder over the other half. You could also use whipped cream but I find that overly rich with this cake.,

instructions, 1. Teff flour is available from a whole foods store or Northern African markets. Nancy's yogurt is best because of its tartness. You want not-sweet yogurt.
2. Whisk (or stir together with your largest fork) the flours salt & baking soda in a large bowl. In a separate bowl whisk the yogurt into the club soda then stir this in the flour mix making a thin smooth batter. Strain to make sure there a no lumps.
3. Pam your largest skillet & heat over medium high heat. Pour about 1/2 cup of batter into the skillet starting in the center & spiraling out. Cook for 20 seconds. (The bread should have a gajillion tiny pinholes in it at this point.) Cover for 30 more seconds. Remove it to a warm platter & cover with a cloth to keep it warm while you cook the rest of the flat breads.
4. Lay a piece of the flat bread on the hugest plate you have. In the center of it put a dipper of your finest zestiest most mouthwatering thick stew. Now eat the stew tearing off pieces of the bread from the sides & scooping up the stew. (Look Ma no fork!) Need another piece of injera?! Sure you do! It could take 2 or 3 pieces to scoop up all that wonderful stew.
5. Once you have gained confidence with this & know your mama isn't going to come make you use a fork add 2 or 3 more dippers of food. Veggies. Green beans & carrots & maybe a wilted spinach salad. Of course you'll need more injera to scoop all that up. But what the heck -- .,

instructions, 1. Warm the water up to 80 deg. (about 2 minute and a half in the microwave).
2. Take about 2 ounces of that water and put in a small cup or plastic bowl.
3. Let the rest of the water stand aside.
4. Pour the yeast in the 2 oz warm water and mix slowly with 1 teaspoon of sugar.
5. Cover and let stand.
6. In a large deep bowl that has a cover mix the flour sugar and pinch of salt.
7. Make a hole in the mix and pour in the risen yeast. Take a whisk (we use our fingers in Africa) and mix until blended. DO NOT USE AN ELECTRIC WHISK.
8. Check that the remaining water previously put aside is still warm; if not re-warm it for about 30 seconds.
9. Pour in the water bit by bit mixing vigourously each time until you obtain a paste with a consistency just before that of a cake mix. Stop pouring the water and discard the rest if any.
10. Mix again for about 5 minutes. Close the bowl and put in the oven for about 2 and a half hours.
11. After that time you can see that the paste had risen for about 2 or 3 times what it was before so choose the bowl wisely.
12. Pour the vegetale oil ( about 30 oz.) in a deep sauce pan. The sauce pan has to be small and deep enough so that the oil fills it at least to the middle.
13. Heat the oil until very hot. Put the heat down to medium wait 1 minute.
14. Mix the paste a bit to bring it down and start putting the paste in the oil using a tablespoon one at the time until there is no more space left in the pan. In Africa again we use our fingers for this part dipping it in water now and then so that it won't stick.
15. REMEMBER to dip the tablespoon in water now and then so that the paste won't stick to it.
16. Turn it over now and then and control the heat; let it cook to a deep golden color. Too much heat will burn the outside while the inside is not cooked. Not enough heat will make the oil fill in the donuts.
17. Remove the donuts from the oil and put in a colander covered with tissue paper to absord the oil.
18. Serve warm.
19. This recipe sounds long and difficult to make but once you make it the first time you'll see that there is nothing to it. I make it in 20 minutes for the mixing 20 minutes for the frying.
20. TIP: If you don't want to wait 2 hours for the paste to rise put in the oven and turn the oven on to warm. It should rise in 30 minutes.,

instructions, 1. chop the chicken and onion and saute in a large sauce pan with the butter and garlic.
2. Once chicken is not longer pink add the chicken broth. I usually use water and boullion cubes but either will work fine.
3. Add the chopped potato. I chop the potato very small to release the startch from the potatoes to make the soup thicker.
4. Bring to a boil and turn down to simmer about 20 min or until potatoes are tender.
5. Add the peanut butter (I like chunky so there are some nuts in the soup) 1 cup at a time. The 3 cups is an estimate. I usually take a large spoon and spoon the PB in let it melt and keep adding spoonfulls until I get the soup the thickness I like.
6. Add paprika ground mustard red pepper flakes and ground red pepper to your own personal taste. I use a lot of the paprika and ground mustard and just a tad of the red pepper since I have little toddlers that don't like spicey food. You can also add cumin and/or ginger if you like those flavors. They work great in this soup.

instructions, 1. Vine Leaves:
2. To prepare fresh vine leaves trim the stalks & wash the leaves under running water. Blanch in lightly salted water for 15 minutes. Rinse then drain & set aside.
3. To prepare bottled vine leaves take the leaves out of the bottle & soak in plenty of cold water for at least 20 minutes. Rinse the leaves individually under running water the set aside.
4. To prepare vacuum packed vine leaves remove the leaves from the packet & soak in plenty of cold water for at least 15 minutes. Rinse the leaves individually under running water the set aside.
5. Finely dice the pepper tomato & onion. Fry gently in a little olive oil along with the minced garlic for approx 4 minutes. Add the spices & seasoning & cook for a further 30 seconds.
6. Remove from the heat & add the rice olive oil & water. Set aside.
7. Broth:
8. Finely dice the onion & tomato & fry gently in a little olive oil. Add the cinnamon & seasoning water stock cube & lemon / lime juice. Cook for 15 minutes.
9. After 15 minutes remove from heat. At this point you can do one of three things: liquidize the sauce strain it to leave just a broth or keep it as it is.
10. Stuff & fold your vine leaves:
11. Remove one leaf from the bowl of water & place in the centre of a dinner plate.
12. Place one teaspoon full of filling into the bottom centre of the leaf - as in the photo.
13. Take the left corner of the leaf & fold up to cover the filling.
14. Do the same with the right hand side.
15. Bring in both sides then gently roll up the leaf.
16. Repeat these steps another 49 times - When folding the leaves be firm but do not wrap them too tightly as they may split as the rice expands. Also don't be tempted to overfill the leaves either.
17. NB: Most prepacked vine leaves come with their stalks attached. If they are tender you can leave them on - tuck them in the leaf or alternatively leave sticking out for a pretty effect. If the stalks are tough then remove them with a pair of scissors.
18. Place carefully one at a time in a large pot. You can put up to 3 layers in a pot if necessary.
19. Place a large plate or dish over the top of the vine leaves & gently pour the sauce broth over the top. Cover & cook on medium heat for at least 25 minutes; until the vine leaves are tender.
20. My family enjoys these hot or room temperature drizzled with lemon / lime juice & good quality olive oil. They are really good served as an appetizer with a selection of dips such as garlic mayo etc.,

time, ,

instructions, 1. Take 1 mixing bowl and place the flour & salt in it. Add the ghee/oil mixture & mix slowly adding the water. Mix well --  until you have a smooth dough place this on your work surface - well dusted with cornflour.
2. Split the dough in half. Make the first 1/2 into golf ball sized pieces. Keep the dough covered with a tea towel --.
3. Take a dough golf ball. If you are comfortable using the pasta machine then just make the ball into a sausage shape and gently roll out with rolling pin to approximately 3-4mm.
4. Begin passing though pasta machine on thinnest setting. NB : if this is your 1st time you can use the pasta machine on the 2nd to thinnest setting before putting it through on the thinnest.
5. In you saucepan melt your ghee on a medium heat. Brush you tray well with ghee using the pastry brush.
6. Lay you first strip of phyllo pastry vertically in the centre the tray. Brush the pastry with the ghee.
7. Repeat the dough rolling process. Cover the tray with phyllo remembering to brush with ghee after each strip. You should be able to do this with 5 strips but don't worry if you use more or less.
8. Turn the tray round so that you're placing the phyllo strips horizontally over vertical strips. This criss cross is very important  so don't forget --.
9. Continue rolling your pastry and layering the tray. Remember the ghee after each strip. Continue doing this until you have done 5 layers.
10. Prepare you nut filling. Take your food processor and chop up the nuts of your choice until you have the required amount.
11. Prepare you nut filling. Take your food processor and chop up the nuts of your choice until you have the required amount.
12. Place the nuts in the 2nd mixing bowl and add the sugar cinnamon vanilla powder and mazhar - enough mazhar to make the filling hold but not so much that it's sloppy.
13. Place filling in the tray over the pastry gently smoothing it out - but don't press it.
14. You now need to repeat the dough rolling layer making stage all over again  until you have 6 layers. You will need to use the 2nd half of the dough by now - just make golf balls again! Don't forget the ghee.
15. When you've finished the 5th layer you can choose how to do the top layer. I always roll out one large sheet by hand by other stick to the pasta machine as a large sheet of phyllo is a bit tricky to create and handle!
16. If you want to try rolling out a sheet remember to COVER the dough rolling pin surface your hands etc in LOADS of cornflour. then roll out the the tray size plus 2cm extra.
17. Now you need to cut the baklawa and decorate.
18. Take you knife and cut vertical straight lines all the way to the bottom. (Approx. 2cm apart)then spin the tray round and cut more lines but diagonally to form diamond shapes. You can also make squares or triangles but traditional Algerian baklawa are diamonds.
19. When you've cut the shapes push a nut into each shape.
20. Brush well with the ghee and place in a pre-heated oven at 180 c for 1 hour - 1 hour 10 minutes --.
21. The baklawa should be golden and now needs it syrup: Warm the honey and mazhar in the saucepan then pour slowly over the baklawa.
22. Allow to sit for 10 minutes then cut out pieces and place in paper cases - preferably the metallic ones as they hold the syrup better.,

instructions, 1. Make the dough and leave it to rise for 2 hours in a warm place.
2. Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan. Add the chillies onions leeks and lemon juice. Cook gently for 12–15 minutes until everything is tender. Add the spices and salt and stir well. Leave to cool and set aside.
3. Preheat the oven to its highest temperature. Knock the air out of the dough then tip it out onto a floured work surface. Cut the dough into 12 portions then lightly flour each one and roll it out as thinly as you can. You are aiming for rough circles around 18 cm (7 in) in diameter. Cook each round on a baking stone for 1–2 minutes until its starts to blister and color slightly. Actual baking time for the whole batch will depend on how many breads will fit comfortable on your stone at a time as stones come in a wide range of sizes.
4. Wrap the breads in a tea towel to keep warm while you bake the rest.
5. When all the breads are ready smear each with a dollop of the chilli mixture. Roll them up and pack them into a baking tray. Warm them through briefly before serving with the goat’s cheese if using.,

instructions, 1. Set oven on 350 deg F.
2. Grease well 2 fairly small bread tins.
3. Mix all the ingredients except the buttermilk. DO NOT fry the bacon: it goes in raw chopped: it cooks in the baking process and adds to the flavour.
4. Add JUST enough buttermilk to make a soft almost sticky dough as for scones. You may not even need the buttermilk as the consistency will also depend on the size of the eggs used.
5. Divide batter between the 2 tins.
6. Bake about 1 hour in the preheated oven or until a skewer comes out clean. Turn out and cool on a rack.
7. It's going to be difficult to guess the servings as the bread is rich and filling. When cool wrap in foil and keep at room temperature or in fridge overnight (assuming you're going to use it on a trip of for school the next day).
8. It freezes well.,

instructions, 1. Dough:
2. Add the sugar to 1/4 cup of lukewarm water. Then add the yeast and stir to soften. Let it sit in a warm place until the yeast is bubbly & doubles in volume roughly 2 minutes.
3. Mix the flours & salt in the large mixing bowl. After yeast is ready add it to the flour along with the milk. Add enough lukewarm water to the mixture to form a stiff dough.
4. Note:Flours differ in their ability to absorb moisture so no precise amount can be given. Add a small amount at a time. If you have added too much the mixture will be extra sticky and it will be hard to get off your hands. The right consistency should allow the dough to pull easily off your fingers.
5. Place the dough onto a lightly floured board & knead hard with closed fists pushing outward. Add the seeds during the final part of kneading.
6. It will take between 10-15 minutes to knead the dough thoroughly. You will know it is ready when it achieves a smooth elastic consistency. (If you are using an electric beater with a dough hook knead 7-8 minutes on a slow speed).
7. With lightly oiled hands form the dough into 4 equal sized balls. Flatten each piece into a rectangle approximately 8x12 inches (20x30cm).
8. Filling:
9. Saute the meat & onion for in a skillet until the meat is no longer pink. Drain then add the rest of the ingredients for the filling.
10. Spread a quarter of the filling down the center of each rectangle. Fold over the right side the then left to form a package that is 3x8 inches (7.5x20cm).
11. Flatten the package out until it is again a rectangle measuring 8x12. Then refold as before until the package is 3x8 inches. Repeat with all 4 balls.
12. Spray two baking pans with cooking spray then place 2 bread packages on each pan. Cover with a clean towel & leave in a warm place for the dough to rise for an hour.
13. Heat a griddle & brush with a little oil or butter. Poke the package five times on each side with a fork. Fry the dough for 8-10 minutes on each side until crisp & golden. Brush with a little melted butter just before serving.,

instructions, 1. Heat up the oil at medium high for 20 minutes.  when you are ready to fry lower the heat to low for 5 minutes so that the cookies dont burn.
2. Mix the dry ingredients. Sift the flour with the baking powder salt and nutmeg in a large bowl.  add the sugar to the flour and mix well.
3. Add the butter to the flour and mix well until the butter is well incorporated with the flour.
4. In a separte bowl wisk the eggs with the water; add it to the flour mixture. Knead it well for 1 minute until it form a nice smooth ball. (if the dough is sticky my secret is to make a little of the flour mixture and then add it to the dough instead of just adding plain flour.  The cookies is tastier when you add a flour mixture as explained in step 2.  If you add plain flour to the sticky dough it will subtract from the taste. But i am sure with trial and error you will get the correct consistency at first try.).
5. It is important to put the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes before you start to shape them.  I shape the dough into a round ball and cut it into 4 equal parts.  When they are cool I start out with 1 part while I leave the others in the fridge to continue cooling.  I put seran wrap or any container to cover the dough so it does not dry on the surface.  ( it is not nessasary to cool the dough but from experience it makes the rolling and frying much easier and the cookies looks very neat as it helps it from sticking together or breaking apart.).
6. When I roll the dough I use my hands to shape it to a rectangle or a square.  I pour small flour on a board and some more over a rolling pin and some on a nice sharp serated knife or any long knife.  There are two ways to cut the chin chin. The easy way is to roll the dough and cut it into 2inches wide by 1/4 inch thick. then you cut it across in the shape of a diamond.  You then slit a hole in the middle of the diamond and carry the tip of the diamond and put it in the hole backwards and strech it.  Dont strech the dough too much or it will break apart. also you dont have to slit the hole. I just pinch a hole in the middle of the diamond and push the tip backwards and strech.  Make sure the hole you pinch is not too big or it might break apart while frying.  Ok the harder less complicated method is to roll the dough thinner 1/6 inch thick by 1/2 inch width.  This should look like long skinny strips.  Then you cut each strip into squares.  Most people settle for this  harder but easier method. Make sure that the chin chin is not dusted with too much flour.
7. Frying.  Like i said earlier preheat the oil and reduce it to low  for 5 minutes when ready to fry.  if the chin chin gets brown right away then that means that this chin chin has burned and did not cook properly because the oil is too hot.  Lower the heat and wait 3 minutes before you attempt to fry again.  Dont put too much or it will burn the oil. When you put the chin chin in the oil it should take about 3 to 4 minutes to cook right. If it is not browning after 1 minute raise the temperature to high until it browns a golden brown.  What I do is I always lower the heat to low when I am not frying. But when I fry I increase the heat to high. then I lower it at low for 3 minutes before I put it the next batch of cookies to fry.  This is all trail and error but I assure it will be easier with experience. Tip: Also remember that according to the size of the pan you frying you have to adjust the oil because this is deep frying.  the oil should be atleast 1 1/2 inch deep in any pan you use.  The wider the pan the quicker you can fry the chin chin.,

3. Sift the 6 cups of flour into the mixture and mix well with a whisk or a wooden spoon.  Then you can begin to mix the mixture with your hand until all the bumps are smooth.  Mix for about 4 minutes.
4. When the mixture is smooth cover with seran wrap and leave it at a warm area to rise for about an hour an hour and a half.
5. Heat up the oil in a pot at medium heat for 15 minutes.  Make sure that the oil is about 2 inches deep so that the puff puff dont end up being flat.  When you are ready to fry the puff puff  lower the heat for a minute.
6. The  puff puff mixture should be nice and risen.  grab small amount fo the mixture with your hand and squeeze small balls through your thumb and index finger.  The balls should rise to the top of the oil quickly.  Raise the oil temperature so that the balls can brown.  You want to cook these balls for about 3 minutes each or maybe 4 minutes so that the inside gets cooked properly.  If you dont want to use your hand to make the balls  you can use a small ice cream scoop.  Remember to lower the oil temperature between each fry.  Also turn them around frequently so they brown all over.  Drain them on a paper towel. and leave to cool for 30 minutes before serving.
7. They taste best with coke or sprite or any soda you might have.,

instructions, 1. Peel all bananas and after doing so split down the middle and then cut in half optional to cut in half but you do need to split it is easier on me to quarter them and makes a good presentation.
2. Place cut bananas aside and melt 1 stick of butter set the other stick aside in case you need more when cooking if you use a lot when dredging the bananas then you will need to melt before starting to fry.
3. Once butter is melted start warming your skillet on medium high watch closely as you will only want to slightly brown when cooking so it wont take long.
4. While skillet is heating up please take your bananas and start buttering both sides of each slice very well. I use a brush to do so or you can dredge them through the butter if you wish but please keep in mind doing so will soak up more butter so please be careful if you do not wish them buttery.
5. After all slices are done add butter in the skillet (enough to coat the bottom well).
6. Then start placing slices in the skillet when you have a skillet full take brown sugar and start adding no measurement is needed as you just cover them.
7. After you coat a side with brown sugar on the first coat flip them over and coat the next side and let them sit for about one minute.
8. After the minute is up flip and coat again as doing so add brown sugar in the pan and let it cook along with the rest it does not have to be a lot but I judge it by the way people like caramel so please just try a little at first as this is very rich.
9. When bananas are golden and slightly brown down the center they are done.
10. Remove from skillet and place on plate.
11. Add whip cream to top and serve hot :-).
12. Then repeat until you finish.
13. Also try other fruits with it I top mine with cold strawberries from time to time.

7. To make this into another very popular salad; batata and zrodia slata simply add 3 cooked carrots cut into approximately 4mm coins. Season accordingly.

instructions, 1. Brown the eggplant in the oil. No need to salt or fiddle at all with the eggplant. I do this in a large skillet on moderate heat and wait quite a while before moving or turning the cubes. You want it nicely browned and cooked through though not mush. The given amount of oil is enough to do this and I have never had to add more. Your pan will look overfull but the eggplant will shrink.
2. While the eggplant is browning prepare the onions peppers and garlic and place into a glass or plastic bowl.
3. Pour eggplant hot and it's oil (if any left though the oil will drain back from the eggplant into the salad during standing for the dressing.) into the bowl over the onion mixture.
4. Top with remaining ingredients and mix well. Refrigerate at least 6 hours and serve chilled or room temperature.
5. Please use fresh lemon juice and to taste. The amount I use is the juice of 1 fresh lemon. Not easy to give an exact measurement on how much juice 1 lemon will yield but I always use 1 lemon.
6. This does need to sit so figure in the sitting time as part of the cook time.,

instructions, 1. Filling:
2. Slice the onions in fine rings. Slice the peppers into fine strips ( many people remove skin first) and fry together in a little olive oil until softened. (If using the hot pepper de-skin then puree add to the onions & peppers.) Add the puree salt and pepper and cook covered for approx 5 minutes or until soft and well flavoured. Set aside to cool.
3. Pastry:
4. *To make the pastry it's easiest if you have a mixer with a dough hook or a bread maker set on the dough setting.*.
5. Mix the semolina and the flour in a mixer of place in the bread machine. Make a hollow in the centre add a little salt and enough water to bring to a stiff dough. Knead well. Add a little more water a bit at a time until the dough is finally a soft elastic consistency - this is usually around 8-10 minutes.
6. Wehen the dough it nice and elastic pull of pieces and roll into golf balls. The secret is to have EVERYTHING WELL OILED --  Oil your hands the work surface and the m'rie or large skillet / chappati pan.
7. Take a golf ball at a time and gently stretch out as thin as you can. It's easiest to do this on a well oiled work surface. If uyou get a few little holes don't worry - you can patch them up and nobody will mind!
8. Place a spoonful of filling in the centre and fold the edges in one at a time (left right top bottom) to form a rough square shaped parcel. Fry until golden on both sides - you have to be very attentive here or they will burn!
9. Any dough left over can be cooked plain and served with honey (great for suhor!).,

instructions, 1. Heat a small skillet over moderate heat.  When hot add white peppercorns aniseed cumin seed coriander cloves and allspice berries.  Stir constantly until fragrant and oils are released (only a few minutes).  Remove from heat and allow to cool in a separate bowl.
2. Husk the cardamom pods reserving the fragrant seeds. I love the flavor of cardamom so I use more than what Paula Wolfert recommends above.
3. Remove seeds and veins from dried chipotles and break apart.
4. Break up nutmeg in a mortar and pestle.
5. Once peppercorns aniseed cumin seed coriander cloves and allspice berries have cooled combine with remaining ingredients in a spice grinder and grind all together until fine.  A coffee grinder works well but then you will not want to grind coffee in it anymore.  Even Alton Brown believes in having a separate grinder dedicated to the grinding of spices.
6. Sift through a strainer to remove fibers from galangale turmeric ginger and any pieces that just do not grind.
7. Store in a glass jar under regrigeration.
8. A typical slather to make is to combine 1 Tbsp of this blend with 1 Tbsp of Spanish smoked paprika.  Crush at least one large clove of garlic into a paste with Kosher salt.  Combine with the paprika and Ras then add olive oil and the juice of one lemon.  Slather over chicken lamb or fish and roast until done.,

instructions, 1. In a medium sized casserole heat the olive oil & gently fry the onion until pale golden. Add the chicken & fry for 15-20 minutes on a medium heat.
2. Add your ras el hanout & the Season All mix well & cook for a few minutes.
3. Wash the preserved lemon really well (make sure to discard the flesh) then chop it very finely & add to the casserole. Cook for a few more minutes.
4. Remove the casserole from the heat add the coriander (cilantro) & allow to cool. Mix in the chopped eggs & re-season if required.
5. Once the filling is cooled completely you are ready to assemble the bourek.
6. Make your flour paste by putting the flour in a bowl & gradually adding the water until you have a very runny paste - a bit like crepe batter.
7. Lay 1 spring roll sheet on your work surface & place 2 generous teaspoonfulls of the filling onto the sheet. You need to place it in a line approx 1" up from the bottom of the sheet & the line of filling should have a fraction over 1" of spring roll sheet visable on both the left & right side.
8. Next bring the left side of the sheet over the filling - it will overlap the filling by about an inch. Do the same with the right side.
9. Take the bottom of the sheet in both hands & pull it up so that it covers the line of filling.
10. With a pastry brush or the back of a teaspoon brush a small amount of the flour paste along the edges of the sheet.
11. Now start to roll the bourek be careful to keep it tight & even. When you have rolled it up securely you can brush a tiny amount of the paste along the seam so that the bourek stays closed whilst it is being fried.
12. Repeat these steps with the remaining 35 spring roll sheets.
13. Now you can either freeze the bourek or fry them in hot oil (I like to deep fry at approx 165-170c) in batches until a deep golden colour & very crispy!,

instructions, 1. In a mixing bowl blend together the fine semolina flour sugar baking powder and salt. Add the butter and blend well. (I use my hands to mix this dough).
2. Add 1/2 cup milk and mix until a dough forms. It should be quite moist and easily packed into a large mound. Add an additional milk if necessary to achieve this consistency.
3. Shape the dough into balls any size that you like – I make them about the size of small plums – and leave the dough to rest a few minutes.
4. Preheat a griddle or frying pan over medium-low heat. While the griddle is heating roll the balls in the coarse semolina (this is optional for appearance and texture) and flatten each ball into a disc about 1/4" thick.
5. Cook the harcha over fairly low heat about 7 to 10 minutes on each side until a pale to medium golden color. Turn only once and check occasionally to be sure the harcha aren't coloring too quickly as they need some time to cook all the way through.
6. Serve immediately with jam cheese or butter. Or dip the harcha in syrup made from melted butter and honey. (To make the syrup heat equal portions of the butter and honey until bubbly and hot.).

instructions, 1. To make the Ras al-hanout spice mixture:  Combine the cinnamon turmeric black pepper nutmeg cardamom and cloves in a small bowl.
2. Thoroughly pat the chicken dry and dredge in the ras al-hanout spices until pieces are nicely covered but not over-loaded.  Place in a bowl or large dish and scatter thyme and garlic over the chicken.  Pour 1/2 C olive oil over and toss to coat thoroughly.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight if possible or several hours.
3. Remove marinated chicken and place on counter for 30 minutes.  Heat 1 T. olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Remove chicken from the dish keeping the marinade and brown chicken on all sides in the hot oil.  (Do not rush this as the browning will help keep the chicken from feeling "dusty" from the spice mix covering it.  This is also why you do not want to over-load the chicken with the spice mix.)
4. Set the chicken aside and add the onion to the Dutch oven cook until translucent.
5. Return the chicken to the Dutch oven adding the lemon and the reserved marinade.  Sprinkle generously with salt.  Add enough broth to almost cover the chicken bring to a simmer cover and cook until the chicken has begun to pull away from the bones and is quite tender about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
6. Remove the lid the last 15 minutes of cooking time to reduce the broth.  If it needs to reduce further remove the chicken and boil the broth until nicely reduced to approximately 2 cups but you can reduce it less if you want more sauce.  You can thicken the sauce with cornstarch mixed with water.
7. Serve with white rice or other grain of choice.,

instructions, 1. Directions are given per brik.
2. Place the phyllo sheet on a work surface.  Phyllo is rectangular.  Either cut it to make a square or fold the phyllo so you work with a single layer sheet.
3. Using only the top half of the phyllo sheet spoon 1 tablespoonful of tuna onto the phyllo.  Sprinkle 1/4 the amount of parmesan onto the tuna. (If using mashed potato put 1/4 of the mashed potato onto the tuna and parmesan.) Dot 1 teaspoon of harissa around the mixture.  Sprinkle on 1 tablespoon or less of parsley. Make sort of an open circle with the mixture.
4. Now crack open an egg and drop it on this mixture in a way that the mixture won't let the egg white run out easily.  The mixture should surround the egg.
5. Fold  the bottom half of the phyllo sheet over the top half.  This will cover the whole mixture.  Seal the edges with egg white as you make the fold.  If you have excess pastry per brik just fold the excess in towards the center of the brik; it will resemble an envelope.
6. Slip this brik into hot oil.  Fry 30 seconds on one side or until the phyllo is a golden brown color.  Turn it and fry the other side also 30 seconds or until the color is golden brown.
7. Continue with the other briks.
8. Serve with lemon wedges to squeeze into every bite salad and tomato.,

We like to stuff them with my precooked kefta (sometimes)but always with onions parsley and tomato (either a bit of Hajar's Wicked Sauce Tomatish) fresh thinly sliced then diced tomato pounded tomato or a small bit of tomato concentrate. If stuffing these are always stuffed thinly not as bulging pockets.

instructions, 1. The first trick to making Moroccan tea properly is to heat up your teapot and "wash your tea" first. Moroccans say that this washing process takes the bitterness out of the tea. To do this you add about 6 oz. of boiling water to about 2 teaspoons gunpowder green tea and then you swish it all around in the teapot.
2. The second part of "washing the tea" involves adding about 10 mint leaves (spearmint or silver mint is the closest we have to their mint) 1/2 cup sugar (or to your taste). You then swish the liquid in the teapot around again and pour out all the water through a strainer while leaving as much of the tea mint and sugar in the pot as possible.
3. After washing and straining the tea you completely fill your teapot by pouring boiling water over the tea and mint leaves. Let it steep for several minutes.
4. Moroccan tea is always served hot in skinny glasses (kind of like tall shot glasses) with about 3 mint leaves in the bottom. You pour the tea into the glass from as high as you can manage without spilling it in order to aerate the tea with oxygen. The glass container is as much of the secret to the taste as the "washing of the tea" and the way you should pour the tea into your glass.,

instructions, 1. Rinse lamb and blot dry.  Trim as much fat away from rack as possible.  Slice between rib bones all the way through to yield eight chops per rack.  Place in large container.
2. Combine Ras el hanout 2 TBSPs of garlic  minced cilantro and olive oil.  You might need more olive oil in order to obtain a smooth slather.  Toss lamb chops in mixture and allow to stand at room temp for an hour or so.
3. Sprinkle coated lamb chops generously with salt and pepper.  Grill over hot fire or broil to desired doneness only a few minutes per side.  When internal temp reaches 130 degrees F they are medium.
4. After removing from cooking source and still hot sprinkle with lemon juice.  (You might get the same result with adding the lemon juice to the marinade mixture before the lamb is cooked).
5. Prepare gremolata topping on same day you are serving the lamb.  Remove pulp from preserved lemons and discard keeping the rind.  Then thoroughly rinse in cold water and mince finely.  Roughly chop parsley leaves.  Combine preserved lemon parsley leaves and remaining tsp of minced garlic. Sprinkle over lamb chops before serving.
6. **************************************************.
7. Preserved lemon:  I usually start with about 5 lbs of organic lemons juicing enough of them to yield about a cup.  Go for organic ones otherwise they have a coating of wax on them to preserve shelf life in the supermarket.  You will need a glass jar with an air-tight seal. Combine ~ a tablespoon of coriander seed with ~ a tablespoon of fennel seed. Place 1 bay leaf and 1 cinnamon stick in the bottom of glass jar. Have a small bowl of Kosher salt nearby. Slice lemons in quarters ALMOST down to stem end but leave intact. Place coriander and fennel seed inside lemon and also fill with salt. Place cut side down into glass jar squeezing as many into the jar as you can. As you squeeze them some of the lemon juice is released but not enough to fill the jar. Just continue packing in as many lemons as you can and add additional salt between layers of lemon. Top off with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Then refrigerate for a month before using. I think this is Jamie Oliver's technique but there are many out there. He has also suggested doing this with other citrus like limes and mandarin oranges. Meyer lemons work nicely. Some techniques suggest a layer of olive oil on top and this works well too.  If refrigerated they last indefinitely.,

4. Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered while stirring for about 2 minutes or until the liquid has reduced by half; remove the pan from the heat and stir in the lime juice nuts and parsley.  Cover to keep warm.
5. Place the grapevine leaves in a large pan of boiling water uncovered for about 30 seconds or until just pliable; and drain in a single layer on absorbent paper towelling. Or if you are using bottled grapevine leaves rinse them thoroughly under cold water then place them in boiling water for 10 seconds then drain in a single layer on absorbent paper towelling.
6. Place one leaf on each plate; layer each leaf with one slice of eggplant a few capsicum slices 1/4 cup of the minced lamb mixture and then cover with another grapevine leaf.  Repeat the layering ending with a layer of the minced lamb mixture.
7. NOTES: Whenever a recipe includes tomato paste (which I find too sharp; it always gives me indigestion) I always use Evelyn's Fried Red Tomatoes Recipe #121041 which I have on hand in small portions in the freezer; and when I'm cooking lamb if stock is required I prefer to use a vegetable stock either my Vegetable Stock Recipe #135453 or (since discovering it recently) Chef Kate’s Roasted Vegetable Stock Recipe #143292.  Baharat is an aromatic all-purpose spice blend that is used throughout the Middle East and is often sold as Lebanese seven-spice.  It can be found in Middle-Eastern food stores.  To make a substitute for baharat combine 2 teaspoons paprika 1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1 crushed clove and 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg.,

2. To prepare the oranges cut off the ends of the fruit so they sit flat on a cutting board.  Then cut down the sides following the curve of the fruit removing the rind and the white pith beneath.  When the rind and pith are all removed hold the fruit in one hand over a bowl and use a small paring knife in your other to cut between the membranes letting the clean orage sections fall into the bowl.  Be careful not to cut down into your hand!  When all the sections are cut away squeeze the remaining fruit pulp in your hand to extract any risdual juice.  Pour the orange segments and juice into a blender and blend for 10 seconds to chop up the fruit.  You should have about 2 cups of juice and pulp.  Combine the orange puree cooled sugar syrup lime juice and spices stir to combine well.  Cover and refrigerate until cold.
3. Stir the chilled mixture then freeze in 1 or 2 batches in your ice cream machine according to manufactures instructions.  When finished the sorbet will be soft but ready to eat. For firmer sorbet transfer to a freezer safe container and freeze at least 2 hours.,

instructions, 1. To prepare the Moroccan Spice Mix for the Chicken: Combine the cinnamon stick cloves cayenne cumin fennel coriander and paprika in a dry skillet over low heat and toast for just a minute to release the fragrant oils; shake the pan so they don't scorch. In a spice mill or clean coffee grinder grind the toasted spices together with 1 1/2 teaspoons of kosher salt and the brown sugar. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Rinse the chicken with cool water inside and out then pat it dry with paper towels. Massage the chicken skin with the spice rub; make sure you don't miss a spot. Season the inside of the chicken generously with salt and pepper. Stuff the lemons halves cilantro and garlic in the cavity and place the chicken in a roasting pan fitted with a rack. Fold the wing tips under the bird and tie the legs together with kitchen string. Drizzle the oil all over the chicken. If you have time let the chicken marinate for 30 minutes to really get the flavors down deep into the meat. Roast the chicken for 1 hour; pop an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh; if it reads 160 degrees F it's done. Allow the chicken to rest for 10 minutes so the juices can settle back into the meat. Remove and discard the skin from the chicken. Pull the chicken from the bone and shred the meat with your fingers or 2 forks. Put the shredded chicken in a large bowl and squeeze the lemon halves that have cooked inside the bird over the meat to moisten.
3. To prepare the Apricot Couscous: Put the couscous in a medium bowl; pour the water over it stir with a fork to combine. Cover and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes then uncover and fluff with a fork. Put the apricots almonds green onions mint and cilantro on a cutting board and coarsely chop everything up; add this to the couscous. Add lemon juice drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss gently to combine.
4. To prepare the Green Olive Sauce: In a small skillet heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Saute the shallots and chile over low heat for 8 minutes until caramelized then scrape into a food processor. Add the olives parsley vinegar lemon juice and 1/2 cup of oil; puree a good 3 minutes until totally smooth.
5. To put the whole thing together: put the shredded chicken and couscous on the lavosh bread add a few spoonfuls of the olive sauce and roll the sandwich up. Wrap in foil and take the sandwich to a picnic if desired.,

instructions, 1. Using the grating disc in food processor grate one onion and set aside.
2. Using chopping blade in food processor mince the garlic and set aside.  Mince jalapeno then chop the two remaining onions and set aside. (Do not combine with the minced garlic or grated onion since ingredients are added to the simmering tajine at different times.)  Chop cilantro and parsley then set aside.
3. Heat olive oil in bottom of tagine or dutch oven with a tightly fitting lid.  Brown lamb adding salt and pepper to taste.  Add grated onion saffron ginger paprika cilantro parsley and garlic and stir with the browned lamb.  Add the can of tomatoes and bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes stirring occasionally.
4. Meanwhile toast cumin seed in a small skillet until fragrant just a few minutes.  Allow to cool then grind in spice grinder.  The Saveur recipe calls for 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin but you might want to use all that you ground.  Or save the rest for another use.
5. After lamb has been simmering for 45 minutes add chopped onions jalapeño and 1/2 teaspoon (or more if you want) of toasted ground cumin then simmer 45 minutes more.
6. Meanwhile poach the quince.  Cut each quince into 6 slices leaving skin on and removing core and seeds.  Using a large skillet poach the quince in simmering salted water until tender about 10 minutes.  Drain off almost all of the poaching water reserving about 2--3 tablespoons in the skillet.   Add 2 tablespoons of butter 2 tablespoons of sugar and the cinnamon making a syrup.  Cook fleshy side down until glazed about 20 minutes.  Turn over and brown the skin side.  Keep warm to serve with the lamb.
7. Simmer okra in a small amount of water until tender about 5 minutes.  Drain and add to tajine.  (The Saveur recipe just adds the okra to the tajine after it has simmered for the 90 minutes.  But when I did this before I simply could not get my okra tender within a few minutes.  Once the okra had finally cooked sufficiently it seemed that some of the other ingredients like the garlic and cumin had overcooked resulting in a bitter flavor.  So to get the flavor right I cook the okra separately).
8. To prepare couscous add 1 cup of boiling water to 1 cup of couscous.  Cover and let stand for 10 minutes.  Then fluff with a fork.
9. To plate serve tajine over the couscous and garnish with the quince.  If you have any preserved lemon add a little to the plate with a few sprigs of cilantro.,

instructions, 1. Rinse the game hens under running water.  Pat dry and cut them in half lengthwise (kitchen scissors work fine).
2. Arrange orange slices in bottom of a 9x13" glass baking dish. Top with game hens.
3. Mix 4 tablespoons fresh cilantro chopped garlic and 1 1/4 teaspoons cumin in bowl.  Rub mixture all over hens.  Wash your hands well with soap and hot water.
4. Whisk together port sherry oil vinegar and honey in small bowl.  Taste it to see if the mixture is to your taste then if it is pour over hens.  (There is quite a difference between the taste of balsamic vinegar – which is sweet – and red wine vinegar so if you use wine vinegar you’ll definitely want to taste the mixture and adjust the amount of honey to your preference before pouring it over the hens.).
5. Tuck dates and olives between hens and season with salt and pepper.
6. Cover and refrigerate at least 12 hours or overnight turning hens once.  (I’ve made this recipe beginning in the morning and marinated it 6-8 hrs during the day too and it was still delicious.).
7. Remove hens from refrigerator and place on counter covered for at least 30 minutes.  (You don’t want to put a chilled baking dish straight into a preheated oven.)  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
8. Turn the hens skin side up then bake hens with marinade dates and olives until hens are cooked through basting occasionally about 40 minutes.
9. Transfer hens dates and olives to serving platter.  Discard orange slices.  Pour the pan juices into a heavy small saucepan.
10. Add remaining 1/4 teaspoon cumin and 1 tsp butter and simmer until reduced to about half whisking frequently about 5 minutes.
11. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon some sauce over hens. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro.
12. Serve passing remaining sauce separately in a gravy or sauce bowl.
13. Note:  when I first made this recipe I didn't have fresh cilantro on hand and couldn't even find dried in our herb stash which surprised me. Mike collects herbs and spices and we have a huge collection in the pantry. (I call him Condiment Man.) I had a bunch of a nice Italian dried herb mix (basil oregano marjoram thyme rosemary savory sage) so used that instead. I know it's not really an equivalent to cilantro but it smelled wonderful anyhow and it tasted great too.  I also add lots more green olives and dates which the recipe reflects  :)
14. Note #2:  if you want/need to serve more than two people you can use the above marinade for up to 6 hens then you’ll need to begin adding more ingredients.,

instructions, 1. For the Marinade:
2. Cut four deep lengthwise gashes equally spaced into each lemon. Put the lemons and garlic cloves in a small microwavable container. Cover and microwave on high until the lemons are soft and juice has exuded from them about 4 minute (If not soft continue to microwave in 30-second intervals). Strain the juice into a small container and let the lemons and garlic cool briefly. When the lemons are cool enough to handle separate them into sections. Scrape the pulp and most of the white pith away with a spoon; discard. Put the scraped lemon peels garlic lemon juice and remaining marinade ingredients in a blender and puree to make a coarse soft paste. Set 2 tablespoons aside to use for the yogurt sauce.
3. To Marinate the Chicken:
4. Put the chicken into a 1-gallon zip-top bag; scrape in the remaining marinade. Massage the bag to coat all the chicken pieces and marinate for 1 to 2 hours in the refrigerator.

6. Build a medium-hot charcoal fire or heat a gas grill to medium high. Dump the chicken into a bowl but don’t scrape off any excess marinade. Put the onion and peppers in the marinade bag and massage them to coat with the marinade (it’s fine if the onion pieces break apart). Transfer to another bowl. Thread the chicken onto skewers positioning a piece of onion and pepper between the pieces of chicken. If there’s extra pepper or onion thread them onto separate skewers if you like.
7. When ready to grill oil the grill grate. Grill the kebabs over direct heat (uncovered for charcoal; covered for gas) turning the skewers every 2 to 3 minute until the chicken is firm and shows no redness when cut into about 10 to 15 minute Check several pieces of chicken to be sure.
8. To Make the Sauce:
9. Combine the reserved 2 tablespoons marinade with the cucumber cilantro yogurt and 2 teaspoons salt. Mix well. (Make the sauce no more than an hour before serving or it will be too watery).
10. To Serve:
11. Remove the chicken and vegetables from the skewers and serve them in a mound with the yogurt sauce on the side.  Garnish with chopped parsley if desired.,

instructions, 1. In a large soup pot stew pot or dutch oven cook the chick peas and white beans seperately until just tender.
2. Using a smaller pot cook the lentils for 20 minutes and drain the beans and lentils.
3. In the same pot saute the onions garlic* ginger paprika and cumin approximately 5 minutes in the oil. I use the olive oil for this one as the Moroccan home cooks who I know will allow this cooking of olive oil rarely and for this recipe.
4. Add the water lentils chick peas white beans  tomatoes carrots pepper and cumin black pepper and salt to taste. Our black pepper used in a teaspoon will impart some good spicy heat to the dish. Should your black pepper not do this then please add a bit more black pepper as we do not use cayenne here.
5. Bring to a boil for a 5 minutes and simmer 3/4  covered  1 to 1 1/2 hours or longer until the beans and lentils are soft but not mushy.
6. I have seen mny similar recipes on the internet stating to puree some of the soup and return it to the pot. While this is a nice idea most Moroccan homes do not have a blender and this soup is not intended to be made as such.
7. Prep. time does not include soaking and pre-cooking the beans.
8. * Omit the garlic if using for Ramadan.,

6. Variation: If you are using brown rice instead of bulgar wheat cover and cook for 20-25 minutes at step three adding more stock if it is needed.
7. Chef's notes: Stirring the bulgar mixture during cooking during step 4 helps to prevent it from sticking to the pan or wok.  When vegetable stock is needed in a recipe since finding - and then posting - this recipe I have used my Vegetable Stock Recipe #135453 which is very different from every other vegetable stock recipe I've ever come across.,

2. In a large heavy saute pan heat 2 T olive oil with 2 T butter over high heat.  Season the lamb with salt and pepper and saute in batches not overcrowding the pan so all sides are browned.  Transfer to a large saucepan or casserole.  Continue this process until allo the lamb is well browned.
3. Reheat the saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add olive oil and saute the onions to translucent about 10 minutes.  Add the spices and cook until the aromas start to come up 2-3 minutes.  Deglaze with some of the stock and add this to the pan with the lamb.  Add the remaining stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat cover and simmer for 45 minutes.  Add the rehydrated cherries with their soaking liquid and the preserved lemon (or lemon zest).  Continue cooking for about 15-20 minutes more or until the lamb is very tender.  Add the honey and season to taste with additional salt and pepper.
4. Serve over couscous mixed with a few chopped Kalamata olives.  Top with toasted sesame seeds and enjoy with a glass of Cabernet Franc.
5. Notes:
6. This dish has A LOT of butter.  By mistake I only used 2 T in stead of ½ cup  Next time I wouldn't use any at all.  There is enough olive oil & liquid from the lamb to sufficiently cook the lamb without the butter.  This will cut calories by A LOT too!
7. I toasted the ground coriander in a frying pan until it was smoky & fragrant.
8. I used beef broth and lemon zest.,

instructions, 1. Starting with the marinade.
2. Stir together in a small bowl 1/2 cup orange juice olive oil ginger garlic paprika cumin coriander crushed red pepper and salt. Mix until well combined.
3. Place chicken pieces including the drum sticks in a releasable zip-lock bag and pour the marinade over the chicken pieces. Seal bag and turn to coat all pieces. Marinate the chicken pieces in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours but this recipe works best to allow up to 24 hours for marinate to penetrate. Be sure to turn the bag occasionally as it sits.
4. Preheat Oven to 325 (F) degrees.
5. Assemble the baking dish by placing a metal grill rack in the middle of a shallow baking dish this elevates the chicken and allows the drippings to fall to the bottom of the pan. Two things will happen here it bastes itself capturing all the drippings and gives a delicious crispy finish to the chicken.
6. Spray the assembled baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade bag and discard the marinade. Place the chicken skin side up on the centered elevated metal grill rack.
7. Add the evenly diced potato pieces to the bottom of the shallow baking pan surrounding the perimeter of the elevated chicken pieces. Don't worry if there is not enough room to get the diced potatoes under the the elevated chicken just fill in the perimeter. Drizzle 2 tbsp vegetable oil over the assemble potatoes.
8. Bake uncovered low and slow for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Baste chicken occasionally with honey baste mixture during the last half hour of baking. (Chicken is cooked with a temperature of 170 degrees (F) for breast halves; 180 (F) degrees for thighs and drumsticks).
9. There is no need to stir and turn the potatoes as they bake. It's important for the potatoes to retain their shape. Too much handling of the potatoes can cause breakage during the baking process.
10. Honey Baste for the Chicken.
11. Mix together in a small bowl 2 tsp orange peel 3 tbsp orange juice and 3 tbsp honey.
12. Meanwhile Prep the cabbage salad 1/2 hour before pulling the chicken out of the oven.
13. In a medium bowl combine chopped cabbage green onions almonds 2 tbsp honey 2 tbsp orange juice and mix until well combined and set aside. But continue to stir the cabbage mixture occasionally in addition to basting the chicken through the last 1/2 hour of baking.
14. Pull the chicken & potatoes out of the oven and set the chicken pieces on a resting board. Allow the chicken to rest for 6-10 minutes.
15. While the chicken is resting remove the grill rack from the center of the drip pan. With a metal spatula begin to scrape and lift the potatoes stirring and mixing them around within the same pan be sure to coat the potatoes with all the pan drippings sprinkle with 1 tsp seasoning salt mix well.
16. Add the potatoes to the cabbage mixture and fold in until well combined.
17. Plate about 3/4 to 1 cup of the cabbage mixture on the bottom place one or two chicken pieces on top and serve.,

instructions, 1. Heat the broth in a tagine or in a thick-bottomed pot with a lid.
2. Add the spices/herbs and seasonings to the broth and whisk to ensure there are no lumps. You can use a real whisk if you want but I just use a fork.
3. Finely dice the onion and place into the seasoned broth. Simmer covered.
4. Finely dice the chillis and add to the simmering onions. Keep the seeds if you like your food hot otherwise remove the seeds before dicing.
5. While this is simmering dice the zucchini and yellow squash. Then cut the bell peppers into long strips. Set both aside in a bowl.
6. Cut chicken breast in half the long way. Take each half and slice along the short axis so that the slices are not more than 1/4" thick. This is easiest to do if the chicken is partially frozen.
7. Add the chicken to the simmering onions and chillis ensuring that the slices are submerged.
8. Add the zucchini yellow squash and bell peppers. Do not stir. It's ok if they are not submerged the steam will cook them.
9. Re-cover and simmer 45 minutes. Serve over couscous or rice. Alternatively remove chicken and veggies increase heat to "high" and reduce the sauce. Add chicken and veggies back heat throughout and serve as a stew.,

2. THE MEAT FILLING:   In a large pan combine 4 chicken breasts (cubed); 1 small onion (coarsely chopped); 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoons fresh thyme (or 1/8 teaspoons dried); and 2 cups of water. At this point you could also add any vegetables you like such as mushrooms (sliced); green peas a potato (peeled and cubed); a carrot (peeled and diced); kernels of corn; etc. Bring to a boil and then simmer until the vegetables and meat are thoroughly cooked (20-30 minutes).
3. THE NUTS:   Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Place 1 cup almonds (finely chopped) in a shallow baking pan. Bake stirring occasionally until golden brown (10-15 minutes). Cool.
4. THE SPICES:   In a small bowl mix 1/4 cup brown sugar 2 teaspoons cinnamon 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger and 1/4 teaspoons ground nutmeg.

Add to the ONION MIXTURE (from above) and cook over low heat stirring occasionally until eggs are softly set. Remove from heat.
7. THE PASTILLA:   Melt 1 cup butter or margarine. Use a brush to grease a 9-inch springform pan generously. Unroll the sheets of the phyllo dough so that they lie flat. Cover the dough with waxed paper and a wet paper towel so that they don't dry out. Line the pan with 1 sheet of dough allowing the dough to extend over the edge of the pan. Brush the piece of dough generously with butter. Top with another piece of dough and brush with butter. Continue this until you have 8 layers of butter-brushed phyllo dough.
8. FILLING THE PASTILLA: For the filling add a layer of THE MEAT FILLING (from above) THE OTHER FILLING (from above) and then THE NUTS (from above). Sprinkle THE SPICES (from above) over the nuts.
9. Fold the remaining sheets of phyllo dough to fit the pan. Reserve 2 sheets for the topping. Stack the phyllo over THE NUTS brushing each layer with butter. Fold the edges of the phyllo that extend beyond the pan in toward the center. Top with the last 2 sheets of phyllo folded to fit the pan; tuck any protruding edges down inside the rim of the pan. Brush with the remaining butter.
10. Using a razor blade or small sharp knife cut through the top layers of the dough down to THE NUTS to mark the pie in 8 wedge shapes.

instructions, 1. Start by sautéeing the meat onions tomatoes in 1 tablespoon of the oil for a couple minutes over a high heat.
2. Grind in some salt and lots of black pepper.
3. Meanwhile heat up some water in a kettle and after a couple minutes add in the parsley and all the vegetables except the courgettes plus enough hot water to cover everything.
4. Cover the pot and cook over a high heat.
5. Next put the couscous in a large bowl and pour over 1/4 cup water.
6. Rub the grains together by using both your hands and moving them back and forth palms together with the couscous between your palms. You make the same form with your hand as if you were praying. Rub until the couscous is no longer clumpy and all the water has been absorbed.
7. Spread the couscous evenly in the top of your couscousiere.
8. If you do not have a couscousiere you can fashion one out of a colander and some cheesecloth. All you need is something to steam the couscous.
9. The two most crucial things are that the colander sits high enough in the pot that the water below will not come in contact with the couscous and also that you have a tight seal between the top and bottom so the steam is forced through the couscous.
10. If you are making your own steamer a cloth wrapped around the pot may help form a tight seal. If you do not have this the couscous will take longer to cook properly because it won't get the same volume of steam going through it.
11. Wait a couple minutes for the steam to start rising through the couscous and then cover and cook for 10 minutes.
12. Take the couscous out and empty into the bowl.
13. Add another 1/4 cup water and some salt then oil your hands with some of the remaining olive oil and rework the couscous the same way you did the first time.
14. It can be very hot so you may have to stir the couscous a few times until you are able to handle it.
15. All the while the stew is continuing to cook.
16. Place the couscous back in the steamer and cover for another 10 minutes.
17. Repeat this process twice or more if necessary until the couscous is light and fluffy.
18. Add the courgettes during the last 10 minute cooking.
19. When ready take out the parsley from the stew.
20. Pile the couscous in a bowl and arrange the meat and vegetables around the sides and on top.
21. Drizzle 3-4 spoonfuls of the cooking liquid over the couscous.
22. If you want hot sauce water it down as well  into a runny consistency with the cooking broth and set out separately for people to add as desired.
23. Eat with your hands if you want to be Moroccan with no one touching the meat until the guest has first reached for theirs or go Western and spoon it out onto plates.,

cuisine, African >> Northern Africa >> Moroccan, 
time, ,

instructions, 1. Brown the flour: This can be done up to a week prior to making the sellou. Preheat the oven to 400F (200C). Place the flour in a very large baking pan and bake for about 30 minutes or until light-to-medium golden brown.
2. Stir every five minutes to prevent burning and to help the flour color evenly. When the flour is cool sift it several times to remove any balls. Cover and store until needed.
3. Toast the sesame: Spread the sesame in a single layer on a large baking sheet and toast in a 400° F (200° C) oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until crunchy and nutty in flavor. (Or toast the sesame in batches in a skillet over medium-low heat stirring constantly.) When the sesame is cool store in a covered container until needed.
4. Fry the almonds: Heat 1/2 inch of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat and fry the almonds in batches stirring constantly until light golden brown. The almonds will continue to darken to a richer golden brown once they're removed from the oil. Drain and cool the fried almonds.
5. Note: Be careful not to let the oil get so hot that the almonds brown too quickly and take on a burnt flavor. The frying should take about five to 10 minutes for the almonds to color properly so that they are cooked inside as well as out.
6. Assembling the sellou: Melt the clarified butter and set aside.
7. In a very large mixing bowl sift the browned flour powdered sugar spices and salt through a fine sieve. Discard any tiny balls of browned flour that remain. Use your hands to toss and thoroughly blend the mixture.
8. Reserve 2-3 tbsp of unground sesames to mix into the sellou for crunch and texture. Finely grind the rest of the sesame seeds in a food processor until almost paste-like.
9. Separate the almond into two bowls. Grind half the almonds to a smooth paste and the other half just until the oils are released. Add both the almonds & sesame pastes to the flour mixture.
10. Next use your hands to toss and thoroughly blend everything together. Taste and add a little more sugar or spices if desired.
11. Gradually work in enough of the melted clarified butter to form a glistening mixture that is moist enough to pack into a ball or mound.
12. Knead the sellou for a few minutes to ensure everything is mixed thoroughly before transferring to a plastic container. (The sellou will continue to absorb the butter and dry a little bit as it is stored.).
13. Let the mixture to cool and then cover. Sellou keeps well for two months or longer in an airtight plastic container. It can also be frozen for up to six months. Allow newly prepared sellou to sit for a day or two before freezing.,

name, Fruit Salad the Healthy Summer Dessert!, 
cuisine, African >> Rest Africa >> Nigerian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. The main idea is to use at least 6 kinds of fruit. The quantity you use does not matter. The usual base fruit is papaya. Don't add anything except fruits! Halve the recipe if you like and remember that leftovers are great for breakfast! Or process into smoothies!
2. A can of litchies drained and halved was one of the ingredients but the Zaar robot slapped me for that so I had to leave it out. Litchies are delicious in fruit salad.
3. Hard fruits like apple are not really suitable.
4. Grapes can be added or any other soft fuits. If granadillas (grenadillas whatever) are unobtainable leave out but they do lend an exotic flavour. We also use ripe guavas or canned guavas chopped.
5. Peel and chop the fresh fruits but not into small pieces: they should be roughly a small bite each. If you added slightly sour fruits (like fresh pineapple chunks) you will have to add some sugar.
6. Drain any canned fruits but keep the syrup.
7. In a large bowl gently mix the fruits.
8. Here you have to eyeball the fruit salad and guess how much juice or syrup you want to add. Let's say you decide on 1 1/2 cups. Add the vanilla to the juice/syrup.
9. I'm mentioning "juice" because there are fantastic pure fruit juices available which can be used instead of the syrup from cans.
10. Beware fruits like blueberries which will stain the entire salad.
11. You can if you like add a sweet citrussy liqueur like Cointreau or Van der Hum but usually kids love this dessert so keep that in mind.
12. I didn't mention oranges: unless very carefully cleaned and every scrap of white pith removed they will eventually lend a bitter taste to the fruit salad. Berries like strawberries can be used but tend to go too soft.
13. The salad usually stands a few hours or overnight before serving. And no it will not last forever because the soft fruits might go mushy and/or discolour.
14. This is ideal for a hot summer's day after a rich lunch. As kids we never ate it with anything but of course it can be served with ice cream cream or custard.,

2. In a mixing bowl stir in the melted butter with the graham cracker crumbs just until they become moist. Put enough crumbs in the pan to fill the bottom. Press firmly and put in the oven for 10 minutes. Take out and allow to cool.
3. With a mixer beat the cream cheese and sugar; add the mascarpone. Add the eggs one at a time. Add the vanilla and Amarula Cream liqueur.
4. Pour the cheesecake mixture into the prepared cake pan and drop heaping tablespoons of Caramel Topping onto batter. Using a toothpick take the caramel and swirl around cheesecake batter. (Do not try to even the batter by dropping pan on counter!).
5. Wrap bottom and sides of pan in aluminum foil and put into water bath. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 30 minutes or until the middle is set. (Cheesecake should be golden on top spring to the touch --  but still a little wabbly. Toothpick insert should be clean.
6. Remove cheesecake to counter and let cool. Place in refrigerator for 2-3 hours to set completely. For Best results and taste set overnight or at least 6 hours before serving. (I can never wait this long --  so I make it at night and put in the refrigerator for the next day).
7. Serve with chocolate sauce fresh berries or fresh whipped cream. (I sometimes add a drizzle more of the caramel sauce ;).

instructions, 1. Very fresh flatleaf parsley gives the best results. Do not use "old" parsley which has been in your fridge for a while. Fresh from the garden is best!
2. Using a blender or food processor blend all ingredients until a puree forms. It can be as fine or as grainy as you prefer. A blender is easiest to use for this smallish quantity.
3. Taste for seasoning. The thickness will depend on how much parsley has been used but the olive oil should be enough to make a thick sauce. Start with 2 tablespoons lemon or lime juice and taste: I did think the 3rd tablespoon was needed to add enough flavour.
4. Serve in spoonfuls on fish fillets or chicken breasts which have been lightly seasoned. Use with other ingredients such a hardboiled eggs as a sandwich spread or filling or on toast and topped with fried or poached eggs.,

instructions, 1. Have a large enough clean glass jar with lid ready. Rinse the mint and shake or pat dry but water on the leaves are fine.
2. Strip the leaves off the hard stems. Usually the soft tips can be used as is.
3. On a cutting board put bunches together and slice thinly with a sharp knife.
4. Measure by packing tightly into the cup measure.
5. Alternately snip finely with kitchen scissors.
6. Put the sliced mint in a jug with a pouring lip and add the vinegar and sugar. Stir well.
7. Do not use the sharp spirit or other white vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is healthy and white vinegars are not.
8. I find that using sugar and vinegar on a 50-50 basis usually gives the right tang but do taste and tweak!  Do not worry about the amount of sugar: you use only about 1 dessertspoon of the sauce as a serving.
9. Ladle or pour the lot into a large enough bottle. The sugar will take time to dissolve so can be kept on the kitchen counter and shaken a few times before it goes to the fridge.
10. If the mint gets used up and there's quite a bit of the vinegar-sugar still left in the bottle simply slice more fresh mint and add.
11. (The mint will lose its fresh green colour to an extent which is normal).,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350 deg F/ 180 deg Celsius.
2. Grease and flour a 9-inch (22 cm) loose-bottomed cake tin.
3. Sift flour baking powder and salt. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy and add the vanilla. Add the eggs one at a time and beat well after each addition.
4. Add the sifted dry ingredients alternating with the milk until you have a smooth sponge batter.
5. Spread the batter in the prepared tin and prepare the topping before the cake goes into the oven.
6. Topping: combine all the ingredients in a small pot stir and heat until the sugar has dissolved.  Pour this over the cake batter and spread evenly.
7. Bake the cake in the preheated oven for 35 - 45 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean.
8. Remove cake carefully and cool on a wire rack.
9. While cake is in the oven make the custard filling.
10. Bring milk and cream just to simmering.
11. Add cornstarch to the sugar then beat egg yolks with this mixture and the vanilla until light and creamy.
12. Slowly in a thin stream add the scalded milk while whisking. Now you need to put this mixture either in the pot you scalded the milk in or in a double boiler. Heat stirring (I prefer stirring with a whisk) until the mixture thickens well. Do not boil it because the eggs will cook and the custard will separate so be very careful.
13. Stir in the butter remove from heat and cool.
14. Once the cake and custard have cooled down split the cake carefully into three thin layers. You can do this with thick cotton thread pulling it through the cake from both sides. Or use a long serrated knife like a bread knife.
15. Sandwich the layers together with the custard filling. The top should be golden with lovely golden sliced almonds.,

4. Add a 2nd layer of sliced tomatoes and season like the previous layer.
5. Add all leftover cheese and use more if you like and sprinkle with coarse black pepper to taste.
6. Drizzle with olive oil. Slice the onion thinly and put rings and slices all over the dish.
7. Now arrange the crustless bread slices over the tomato dish so that the top is completely covered. You may have to cut the bread slices to fit. Sprinkle liberally with olive oil.
8. Bake the dish for about 20 - 25 minutes until the bread topping is crisp and browned.
9. Yes tomato liquid will form in the bottom of the dish -- dip extra bread in it or drink it with a spoon because it's delicious!,

instructions, 1. Skip the first few steps if you are using ground beef and pork.
2. Prepare beef and pork by trimming off all sinew and other nasty bits and pieces that may affect the texture.
3. To facilitate mincing cut meat into long narrow strips about 3 inch in diameter and freeze for about 30 minutes.
4. Mince meat through a course mincer for a rough texture or finely if you prefer.
5. Allow the meat to be fed through with very little assistance from the tamper.
6. Finish off by mincing a piece of bread to remove every vestige of meat from the mincer.
7. Roast coriander and cloves in a dry frying pan tossing the spices about until uniformly brown and aromatic.
8. Don’t allow to burn.
9. Grind spices with a pestle and mortar sift to remove husks mix with remaining spices and sugar and sprinkle over the mince.
10. Lightly mix in wine or vinegar.
11. Drain the casings and place over one end of the filling horn (I use the kitchen aid attachment and carefully push all of the casings on leaving a 3 inch length hanging down).
12. Tie a knot in this.
13. Grabbing hold of a second pair of hands at this point makes wors-making less traumatic.
14. You can then feed the mixture in while your assistant hold the casings guiding the filling inches.
15. Feed the mixture into the mincer a little at a time while securing the casing with a gentle pressure of one hand on the horn to control the unrolling of the casing as its filled.
16. Mould the sausage with your hand to make it uniformly thick.
17. Don’t pack the casings too full or the wors will burst while cooking but try to avoid air bubbles.
18. After the casing has been filled remove it – still attached to the horn – from the machine.
19. Push any remaining filling into the casing and tie a knot in the end.
20. BBQ quickly over hot coals.
21. The skin should be crisp and the middle just pink.

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 380 deg F/180 deg Celsius.
2. Grease cookie tins.
3. (** The story of the fat: we can always buy raw pork or mutton fat from a butcher or supermarket butchery dept. To render cut this fat into small cubes put (in batches) in a heavy-bottomed pot and leave over low heat for the fat to "melt out". Pour off the fat at frequent intervals into a container to prevent the fat browning in the pot. Do this before you start baking and save the fat in the fridge in a closed container).
4. In a large container mix very well: the flour brown sugar baking soda cream of tartar salt and all the spices.
5. Rub in the butter and Crisco or fat with your fingers and palms until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
6. Whisk the eggs add just 1/2 cup sweet wine to the eggs then stir into the dry mixture.
7. Stir this in well and if still too dry to form a dough add more of the sweet wine to form a fairly stiff dough.
8. The dough is easy to handle and can be kneaded at this stage to mix well and to form a dough you can roll out.
9. Roll out thinly in batches on a floured surface. Keep gathering up the unused dough press together and roll out again.
10. Make sure your oven grid is in the centre of the oven as cookies burn easily on the bottom especially if you use dark tins.
11. Press out large round cookies carefully place on the greased tins and bake in batches in the preheated oven.
12. Check cookies after 5 minutes; don't let them burn. Cooking time depends on your oven and size of cookies but is generally about 7 minutes.
13. Remove with an egg-lifter and let them cool and harden on wire racks. Store in airtight tins.
14. The amount given below is a guess: any smaller and you will get up to 130 cookies or more. The cooking time is based roughly on the several batches you will have to cook.
15. Can be made weeks before using.
16. Although I give an approximately number of cookies it will depend on your cookie cutter. A smaller cookie cutter will yield up to 130 or more cookies.,

instructions, 1. Prepare measure out and mix all the ingredients for the marinade. Whisk well.
2. The recipe mentions "2 spareribs" but you'll know how much you need or whether you want to cut it slightly smaller than 2 pieces which are quite large.
3. Pour the marinade over the ribs and brush it on all over. (Use a glass or other non-reactive container).
4. Loosely cover and leave for a few hours. Overnight is best.
5. Grill over hot coals until it threatens to catch. Turn once and grill for about another 10 minutes while you brush on the marinade every now and then.
6. Leave the grilled ribs under foil (in a warm spot) for a few minutes cut up into pieces easily taken in hand (!) and present on a heated plate. Whether you need more salt is a question of personal taste.
7. Surprisingly this salad idea goes well with it: thinly sliced red onions which were mixed with a little sugar and a pinch of salt and sprinkled with lemon juice. Do ahead so sugar can melt. (Just use your own intuition: no recipe exists!).,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 150 deg C or 300 deg F. Use the butter to grease a cookie tin. (If you like cover the greased tin with baking paper and grease again).
2. Separate the eggs putting the whites in one mixing bowl and the yolks in another mixing bowl. Add the cream cheese salt breadcrumbs and rosemary to the yolks.
3. Add the cream of tartar (if using) to the egg whites and whisk whites until really stiff with firm peaks.
4. Using the same beaters egg white shaken off  mix the egg yolk mixture until smooth.
5. With a spatula carefully fold the beaten egg whites into this mixture. Do not overmix but try to fold the whites in as best as possible.
6. Drop heaped tablespoonsful of the mixture on the greased tin.  Leave space between the heaps. You should have about 10.
7. Bake for about 25 minutes until puffy and golden-brown on top. They do not puff up enormously. Check them before the time is up as ovens differ.
8. Remove and cool on a rack. They might be crisp for a while but will soften. (High humidity like at the coast will prevent them from ever being really crisp).
9. Use the smooth side on which they were baked for healthy toppings or put a meat or chicken mixture between two and pretend it's a bun!,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 150º C/300 degrees F. Put cream and vanilla pods in a pot and heat through but remove before it boils and put to one side. In a large bowl whisk together egg yolks and sugar until the mixture is smooth. Then slowly blend in one cup of the warm cream vanilla mixture while whisking. Then take this mixture and add it to the rest of the hot cream and whisk well. Now here comes the tricky part – split the mixture into two separate bowls. Mix the chocolate into the one and the Amarula liqueur in to the other. Now find a handy mate to help you fill the ramekins. You each take the same size ladle and from either side simultaneously drizzle equal quantities of the two mixtures into the ramekins – and voila! A two-tone cup of custard!
2. Place these in a water bath (large pan filled with 3 -6 centimetres of hot water) and bake until set around the edges but still soft in the centre between 30 and 60 minutes. Take out of oven and leave in the water bath until cooled. Remove ramekins from water and chill for at least 2 hours.
3. When you’re ready to serve sprinkle about 2 teaspoons of sugar over each custard and using a small blowtorch heat sugar until it caramelises. If you don't have a torch place the ramekins under the grill until the sugar melts and then re-chill custards for a few minutes before serving. Very simple very impressive and its smooth and just plain yummy!,

2. (The extra tablespoon butter is because the original recipe is metric and asks for 125g butter which is slightly more than 4oz).
3. Use a rectangular cookie tin about 12 x 9 inches or slightly smaller.
4. Grease it well and line with baking or wax paper and make sure there is a good overhang to provide you with a grip to lift out the cake later.
5. Cream butter and 3 1/2 oz (125 ml) of the superfine sugar very well until pale and thick. Add the egg yolks and whisk in very well.
6. Sift the flour cocoa baking powder and salt into a bowl. Add the vanilla to the milk.
7. Add the soft butter and milk in turns to the dry mixture and whisk in well.
8. Spread this mixture evenly into the prepared pan: it will be a thin layer.
9. Whip the 2 egg whites until stiff then add to it the remaining 4 1/2 oz of superfine sugar and whisk in until you have a glossy meringue.
10. Crush the nuts: a mixture of walnuts or pecans plus almonds taste very good.
11. Spread the meringue over the cake layer. Sprinkle over the nuts.
12. Bake 20 minutes or a little longer (my sister said the original recipe says 20 minutes but she felt it was a bit short).
13. Cool cake completely in the pan. Then slide out carefully with the help of the paper overhang and perhaps a spatula if needed to a cake rack.
14. (Even if cake cracks it does not matter: it won't be seen!).
15. Halve the rectangular cake.
16. Whip the cream until very firm. Put all of it on one half of cake and then put other cake half on top of the cream layer. This cake needs no topping but you could sieve over some cocoa.,

instructions, 1. Sift together the flour cornstarch (sugar if using) and salt.
2. Rub in the butter until it resembles fine crumbs (can be done in a processor; use high speed).
3. Dissolve the cream of tartar in the water and add to the crumbly mixture. Again you'll need high speed to bring the mixture together into a dough.
4. Turn out into a bowl if you used a processor.
5. The pastry should be very easy to handle. If at all necessary add a few drops more water but be careful. When the consistency is right it does not stick to your hands and feels silky soft but firm.
6. Cover with clingfilm and refrigerate until 15 minutes before you need it or otherwise about 20 - 30 minutes.
7. Mariette's instructions were to roll out between clingfilm but that should not be necessary. I simply sprinkle flour on my granite counter and roll out 1/2 the pastry to start with -- easier to control.
8. As you cut it to whatever shape you want gather the bits together press into a roll and roll out again.
9. Use dough to line loose-bottomed small pastry tins or a 9 - 11 inch (26 - 28 cm) diameter loose-bottomed springform cake tin.
10. Simply add your prepared filling and bake at 350 deg. F (180 deg C) or as recipe indicates. It's best baked set on an oven tin with a dark finish which ensures a well-baked bottom crust.
11. Any leftover dough can be frozen.

instructions, 1. In a large bowl mix the ingredients from the yoghurt down to the salt. Whisk well. It's best to do this well ahead and leave this sauce covered at room temperature -- the flavours meld and improve a lot.
2. Place the cleaned shrimps (preferable in one layer) in a large oven dish or tin and coat the shrimps with the mixture. Keep some of the sauce for later if there is enough. Shake the dish so the thickish sauce penetrates to the bottom of the dish.
3. Marinate the shrimps in the fridge for 1 hour.
4. To grill over hot coals skewer the shrimps close together on skewers (soaked in water if using wooden skewers). Grill quickly and carefully only until they curl up and turn pink using any leftover or extra sauce to brush them with.
5. Or bake in a 350 deg F/180 deg C oven brushing once with the rest of the marinade.
6. Bake only until they turn pink and curl up -- better watch this as I forgot to time this bit!  If they're cold out of the fridge they will take longer -- it's better to take the dish out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking time. (Tonight cold from the fridge they took only about 20 mins to cook).
7. If done in the oven serve with the juices over rice. If grilled on skewers serve with salads and bread.
8. Be warned that shrimps shrink a lot in cooking and as a main dish 2 lbs/1 kg will really only serve 4 adults!
9. You could stretch it by serving it as a starter on baby mixed greens moistened with vinaigrette. Serve with crusty bread.
10. Prep time does not include cleaning the shrimps or the marinating time.,

instructions, 1. Cut the beef into strips about 4cm thick. Pack the meat into a smallish bowl so that it fits tightly.
2. Add the vinegar and Worcestershire sauce. Leave for 30 minutes.
3. Meanwhile mix the coriander and pepper together in another bowl.
4. In a third bowl mix the salt sugar and bicarbonate of soda together.
5. Remove the meat from the marinade but reserve the marinade for later use.
6. Add the beef to the bowl of spices mixing it around until evenly coated. Save any spices that don't stick.
7. Bury the spiced beef in the salt and the sugar mixture and leave it for 3 hours.
8. Remove the beef from the brine and dip it back into the reserved vinegar marinade for another 5 minutes.
9. Remove the beef from the marinade and using the vinegar wash all the salt off (don't skip this bit or the biltong will be unbearably salty).
10. Squeeze the beef to remove as much liquid as possible. Roll in the spices once more. The meat is now ready for hanging.
11. Cut lengths of string and tie them tightly around one end of each beef strip. Tie the string to the top of your hanging contraption and make sure that they hang freely without touching anything on the sides or bottom.
12. Leave the strips hanging for 3-20 days in a warm dry place. It is difficult to say exactly how long it will take for the biltong to reach the correct stage it's basically when the meat is as tough as old boots!,

instructions, 1. Rinse the oxtail chunks and using a large stewpot put them in with the onion chunks and red wine. Bring to the boil.
2. Cover pot with a lid turn heat to lowest. Check the liquid level now and then. You may need less than 2 cups red wine or even more.
3. Let simmer slowly for as many hours as it needs until the meat is tender and almost falling from the bones.
4. Pull pot off heat and cool. If your kitchen is cool leave it there until the next morning. If in doubt keep in the fridge. Next day scrape out the top white fat and cut off some of the fattiest bits -- but oxtail is supposed to be rich so do not try to remove much fat.
5. About an hour before dinner put the stewpot on the hob again and bring to a simmer. Add salt (taste!) the garlic Worcestershire sauce ground cloves and tomato ketchup.
6. Whisk either flour or gravy powder (Bisto) into the stew and stir as well as you can until the sauce thickens slightly.
7. Add extra seasoning to taste as suggested. But oxtail is so flavoursome it really does not not many extras.
8. Serve with sticky rice or boiled potatoes.  One veggie such as green beans is fine and grated carrot with orange juice is a great salad with this stew.,

instructions, 1. * About the chicken: it's hard to get a chicken larger than 3 lbs. Buy a nice chubby chicken and make up the shortfall with a pack of chicken pieces. We prefer the brown meat which is more flavourful than breasts).
2. Defrost the pastry in the fridge or at room temperature but make sure it stays cool. If you made My Gran's Sour Cream Pastry keep in plastic wrap in fridge until needed.
3. Use a large pot like a soup pot. Add the water and then the whole chicken any extra fat removed. Add giblets as well if available.
4. Sprinkle over the stock powder or granules: please note that you use the stock powder itself not a mix made with water!
5. Put on lid. Bring to boil turn down heat keep lid on and boil chicken gently until almost tender about 45 minutes.
6. Then soak the sago granules in a little warm water -- they swell a little -- and add stirring it into the water around the chicken.
7. Simmer with lid on until chicken flesh almost falls from bones and the sago has turned into translucent little pearls.
8. Take chicken out of the sauce and leave in a dish to cool down. Leave the sauce in the pot but give the bottom a good scrape to loosen the bits that stick. Bits of meat can stay in the sauce just lift out any bones with a slotted spoon: the wing tips often fall off into the sauce.
9. When the chicken and sauce have both cooled down enough take all the bones from the chicken and cut up the meat. This is a messy job but be careful to remove all small bones. Use ALL meat and skin. Don't cut up meat too finely -- bite-sized. Rub soft meat and skin off carcass and wings so you use it all.
10. Then with a slotted spoon remove  remaining meaty bits from the sauce in the pot and add all edibles to the chicken meat discarding small bones. Don't worry about the sauce in the pot: it will still have bits in it.
11. Add the flour to the sauce and whisk in smoothly. A wire whisk usually does the job with no lumps remaining. Add all the  flavourings to the sauce and taste the result -- chickens differ flavourings differ. Adjust to your taste. Be especially careful not to oversalt so taste before you add the salt. (Some chicken stock powders are salty others not).
12. Beat the eggs in a bowl and add to the sauce.
13. Now add the chopped chicken to the pot again. Stir through with wooden spoon. Taste again: you might want more seasoning at this stage and you can also add a touch of chilli if you like.
14. Set oven at 220 deg C (425 deg F).
15. On a floured board roll pastry out thinner (if necessary) and to fit the top of your dish. Beat an extra egg in a small bowl.
16. Using a suitable oven dish scrape the chicken with its sauce into the dish.
17. Slice up the ham and scatter over the top. This filling should come up to within 1 1/2 inch or 3 cm from the top of the dish.
18. Paint the edges of the dish with beaten egg to help the pastry stick then cover loosely with the puff pastry. Do NOT stretch: leave a bit of slack as the pastry will shrink as it bakes. Press the edges neatly with your fingers all around the dish then cut off excess pastry with scissors or a sharp knife.
19. Brush the pastry with the extra beaten egg. Put into the hot oven. After 15 minutes turn heat down to 180 deg C (350 deg F) and bake for about 1 hour or until pastry is puffed up and golden and you can see the filling sizzling underneath (if using a glass dish).
20. Suggested side dishes: South African Yellow Rice or roast potatoes steamed green beans sweet potatoes and a tomato salad.

time, ,

instructions, 1. (A step-by-step demo of this prep was posted in the African Forum and should appear also in the Index thread under "Beef" in the Kitchen Information Reference Forum).
2. Heat oven to 325 deg F/160 deg C IF you intend roasting the fillet immediately after preparation.
3. A whole fillet has one thick part and then tapers to a narrow point at the end. In this shape it is not very useable.
4. First trim off the shiny sinew which covers part of the top of the tenderloin by scraping it off gently with a sharp paring knife so as not to waste meat. Trim off excess fatty bits. WEIGH your tenderloin which is important for oven timing.
5. Fold the thin end like a fish tail towards the thick end and then start tying up the folded "tail end" very tightly with kitchen string. Truss the entire tenderloin this way at intervals of 1/2 inch. In the end you should have a piece of meat which seems equally thick and will be easy to handle.
6. Mix the flour ginger salt and pepper in a dish into which the meat can fit.
7. Rub or pat the entire roast with the mustard.
8. Put it in the flour mixture and with the help of a spoon and your hands scoop up and pat this on all over the meat.
9. At this stage it's oven-ready and can be covered and rested either at room temperature or if for longer than an hour in the fridge. It's best to bring it to room temperature before roasting.
10. You can time your tenderloin more or less like this: 15 minutes per pound at 325 deg F/160 deg C should almost guarantee you a rare roast provided it wasn't freezingly cold when it went into the oven. Twenty minutes per pound should yield a medium-rare roast. If that's still too undercooked to your taste give it 15 minutes extra in the oven i.e. 75 minutes at 325 deg F. Personally I think any more than that and it will be too well done.
11. Test the roast about 2/3 through roasting as described in the intro. Convection ovens like mine are notoriously fast (I can't work out exactly why because the temperature is correct!
12. Remove and rest the roast for 15 minutes at least. It can be left in a warming oven and do warm your serving plates as well.
13. For the sauce crush the (drained) peppercorns in a mortar and pestle. If you don't have one put the peppercorns in small batches in a tablespoon and use the rounded part of another tablespoon to crush them a little.
14. Mix all ingredients well and ladle into a small bowl. This can be heated gently in the warming oven with the meat or you can heat it over low heat in a small pot first.
15. Slice hot at the table using a very sharp knife to avoid pushing down on the meat and letting the juices run out. Serve with a spoonful of the sour cream sauce and side dishes of your choice.,

instructions, 1. Gather your spices together and peel and chop the ginger. Put the 10 spices -- from the coriander seeds down to the garam masala -- in a mortar and pestle or even in a coffee bean grinder. Mash them together so the cardamom pods burst and the whole thing becomes a mess of spices.
2. Then heat the oil in a pot add the onion over fairly high heat and stir now and then for a few minutes. Add the spices you mashed or grinded and stir. You might need to add more oil: spices slurp up oil as they fry. Don't worry you will be able to skim it off again later.
3. Stir and fry spices and onion for about 2 minutes. Add the can of chopped tomatoes and stir. The heat should be high enough so everything bubbles together.
4. Add the chicken pieces and stir to coat well keeping heat high until everything is bubbling away.
5. Turn heat way down until it just simmers put on a lid and cook for about 20 minutes.
6. Sprinkle over the garlic sugar lemon juice and salt.

9. Please note that it is easy near the end of cooking to skim off extra oil/fat with a spoon as it collects in corners of the pot. On my photos you can see there isn't much oil or fat on the dish.
10. Serve this with rice. Tonight I served this with green vegetables and what you might call "grits and beans".,

instructions, 1. Before you start cooking the fish mix the topping.
2. Whisk the egg white until stiff.
3. Mix the mayonnaise cheese and mustard and fold in the stiffly whisked egg white.
4. To cook the fish use any one of two methods:
5. Lightly flour the fish fillets and fry in a skillet in oil over high heat for a couple of minutes per side -- rather underdone than overdone as it will keep on cooking with this method.
6. OR sprinkle lemon juice over the fillets and brush 1 tablespoon butter over each one.
7. Dust the fish fillets with a mixture of salt flour and chopped herbs.
8. Grill in your oven under the grilling element until top of fillets turn white: only a few minutes. Turn carefully give it another minute and remove. Do not overcook which is death to fish!
9. Remove dish from oven spread the topping over the fish fillets then put back under a (hot) oven grill and grill until golden brown. This happens very quickly so keep watching it!
10. This makes 4 servings with buttered baby potatoes a bright vegetable salad and chilled wine!
11. **If the fish sounds too much for 4 people keep in mind that fish and all seafood shrink in cooking.,

instructions, 1. With a sharp knife or cleaver cut through the backbone of the chicken. Then with kitchen scissors cut out most of the thin bony back part.  Open the chicken by pressing hard on the breastbone. (I prefer cutting out much of the breastbone as well but don't cut through the chicken skin). Remove any extra fat flaps.
2. Fry the fennel seeds in the oil add the sliced leeks and saute until the leeks have softened stirring often over high heat. This takes about 5 - 7 minutes.
3. Using a deep casserole layer the leeks on the bottom. Cover with a layer of apple slices. It doesn't matter if they overlap. Strew over the crumbled feta cheese then sprinkle over as much thyme as you like the garlic and a little salt and pepper.
4. Put the potato slices on the apple layer: again they'll probably overlap.
5. Sprinkle the potato slices lightly with salt.
6. Season the inside of the butterflied chicken with your favourite seasoning salt. (My current top favourite is made under the "Peppadew" brand and contains salt garlic onion peppadews bell peppers and chillies dried and finely crushed of course).
7. Lay the opened chicken skin side up on the bed of leeks apples and potatoes and pour over the cider. Season the skin side well with your favourite seasoning and add extra thyme as well.
8. The dish can now be covered and refrigerated.
9. To bake heat oven to 350 deg F/180 deg Celsius When the correct heat is reached bake the dish for 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 hours depending on the size of your chicken.,

instructions, 1. Wash and tail beans. Please note that you could use more; the quantity doesn't matter. If you're cooking for more than 4 people use more beans and maybe 2 potatoes.
2. Cut the beans cross-wise into rounds -- anything from thinly sliced to 1" long.
3. Carry on until all the beans have been cut.
4. Put in a pot and slice the peeled potato and onion over the beans.
5. Add about 1/3 cup water sugar white pepper and salt.(Yes white pepper is the best here but black pepper is fine). Don't mix: just put lid on and bring to boil then lower heat and let simmer.
6. Bring to the boil lower heat put lid on and let the whole lot simmer until everything is very soft.
7. Using one of those utensils (name?)which you use to mash any vegetable roughly mash the beans potato and onion but don't try to beat it to a pulp -- there should be texture left (see photo's!).

2. (I find the above simple flavours quite adequate but feel free to add fresh chopped herbs such as thyme and rosemary).
3. Wash and dry then slice the stem tops off the peppers. Remove the seeds and as much of the ribs as possible. (Use nice large peppers).
4. (*Do make sure the peppers will stand upright on their bottoms. These are not always even so you might need to slice off a tiny bit here and there to make them stay upright. Try not to slice through the flesh!).
5. Season very lightly inside with salt and pepper (capers are salty so don't season if uncertain).
6. Peel the tomatoes as thinly as possible.
7. Put a tablespoon of capers and a tablespoon chopped onion into each pepper cavity and pop a peeled tomato into each one.
8. Add a tiny pinch salt and pepper to each tomato top and sprinkle over each a 1/2 teaspoon sugar. (This is important for flavour -- do not leave out).
9. Dribble a tablespoon (or less) olive oil over each stuffed pepper.
10. Fit the stuffed peppers into a smallish oven dish so they stand close together and can't fall over. Add a tiny bit of water to the dish (they'll shed their own liquid anyway).
11. Otherwise bake alongside a roast with other roasting vegetables. If doing this remember that a lemon juice-honey-mustard dressing is great on roasting veggies and will complement the flavour of the stuffed peppers.
12. Roasting time: about 1 hour. Don't bake until the peppers collapse.,

instructions, 1. Put all the dry ingredients in a processor.
2. If not using a processor put in a mixing bowl and mix well.
3. Add the eggs and process well until a thick batter forms -- or mix well in the mixing bowl. The batter should almost hold its shape when tested with a spoon.
4. If the batter is too stiff add a tiny amount of milk. If by any chance it is runny add more flour (shouldn't happen!).
5. Heat oil in a pan using medium to high heat to start with.
6. Scoop up heaped tablespoons of batter and drop into pan but not too close together. You won't have huge fritters as some of the batter will stay clinging to the spoon.
7. Fry until firm and golden on the underside then flip over and fry on other side.
8. (You could use a non-stick pan and not use oil or butter but a little oil is preferable).
9. The fritters will puff up slightly and keep their shape but will deflate a bit as you take them out of the pan. To test for doneness press very lightly on the fritters. When done they will tend to spring back. If still uncertain press harder: no batter should run out the sides.
10. Serve warm either as a side dish or as a dessert with plenty of crunchy cinnamon-flavoured sugar.
11. NOTE 1: The pumpkin MUST be dry. We do not have canned pumpkin in South Africa and would use home-cooked pumpkin. Whatever: drain very well or cook the pumpkin in a pot without a lid until all water has evaporated.
12. NOTE 2: I do not know if your canned pumpkin is sweetened. If so don't add sugar -- it's your choice.
13. NOTE 3: I specified yellow sugar which Zaar's format does not recognise. Use brown or white if no yellow granulated sugar available.,

instructions, 1. Trim excess fat to <1/8" on the short ribs (I had about 15) and place into a gallon size zip-top bag.  It is not recommended to remove the silverskin from the bone side as that what attaches the meat to the bone.  Removing it will allow the meat to fall away from this handy device resulting in the need for western utensils.
2. Whisk together all the marinade ingredients until the sugar has dissolved and pour into the zip-top bag.  Remove as much air as possible and seal.  Lay the marinade bag on plate in refrigerator overnight and up to 3 days turning once in awhile or when you visit the fridge.
3. For best results use a smoker (or Weber Kettle grill with a wet setup - Google it) .  I placed the water tray filled halfway with hot water in the bottom of my smoker and set the smoker to 225° F.
4. I placed the short ribs evenly spaced on two racks and set the vent to half way.  I cook with low wet heat for about three hours then lower the heat to 190° F for a further 3 hours.
5. After six hours of low wet heat I add some Hickory and Apple chips to the smoker and open the vent to full for a light smoke.  I allow this smoke for 1 hour and remove to a plate to cool.  Do not cover with foil or "Texas Crutch" these or you will end up with pot roast wrecking all that work you did.
6. I served these delightful beef nuggets with two side salads of carrot and cucumber and Maque Choux a traditional NOLA side dish inspired by the indigenous first people of our nation and amalgamated by the Acadian French cooks of olde.,

instructions, 1. Wash and peel the ginger by using a peeler or a knife; just as you would with a carrot. Slice it diagonally or transversally. Leave aside.
2. Wash the spring onions and shake off the excess water. Then cut them julliene style. It they are too thin and difficult to julienne then finely slice them in a diagonal direction. Leave aside.
3. Wash the coriander and shake off the excess. Roughly chop them and leave aside.
4. The fish should be as fresh as possible and thoroughly scaled. Even though they would do this at the fish shop you should make sure by yourself.
5. Use a knife to remove any scales that might be left (always from tail to head – opposite to the scales direction) paying special attention to the head and the areas near the fins.
6. Use kitchen shears to trim the fins. Leave the tail whole for presentation purposes. Check the cavity and the gills and remove any leftovers.
7. Wash and shake off the excess water.
8. Make a diagonal cut on each side of the fish. This will help to cook the fish evenly and it will be easier to check if it is done.
9. Rub the salt on the fish.
10. Place half of the ginger in a heat-proof dish put the fish on top and then cover with the remaining ginger.
11. Use a wok or a saucepan big enough to hold your heat-proof dish. Place a metal steam rack and add water. Bring to a boil then place your heat-proof dish with the fish and put the lid on.
12. Steam for about 15-20 minutes until the fish is done. You can look into the diagonal cut and the flesh should be opaque all the way to the bone.
13. Meanwhile when the fish is nearly done put the oil in a frying pan over high heat.
14. Carefully remove the heat-proof dish (remember that it will be very hot). Drain the liquid lift your fish with care and place in an elongated presentation plate which should be heat-proof too. Remove the ginger.
15. Sprinkle the spring onions and coriander on top and pour the soy sauce all over.
16. When the oil is smoking hot carefully pour it over the fish. Be very careful while handling the hot oil.

Spread out on a cookie sheet or jellyroll pan and put in refrigerator (or freezer if you’re in a hurry) until thoroughly cold. Saute meat in wok in 1 - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil until no longer pink. Continue to saute until all moisture/juices have evaporated. Meat should appear dry. Spread out on another cookie sheet or jellyroll pan and put in refrigerator (or freezer if you’re in a hurry) until thoroughly cold. Stir together cooled meat binder mixture cooled cabbage and carrots bamboo shoots mushrooms and green onions. Mix well. Make sure filling is cool to the touch.
3. Combine sealer ingredients and mix until smooth. Place one wrapper on the counter with a point facing toward you so the wrapper looks diamond-shaped not square. Place a small amount of filling about 1/4 cup about 1/3 of the way up on on the wrapper. roll the wrapper tightly tucking in the sides to form a narrow finished roll about 1/2 to 2/3 inch in diameter. Seal the roll by brushing the triangle end flap with sealer for about the last 1-1/2 to 2 inches. Keep finished rolls under a damp towel or a couple of damp paper towels. Can be refrigerated or frozen at the point. For long term storage in freezer put rolls in plastic bags.

5. Heat 1 quart vegetable oil in wok to about 350 degrees. Add rolls one at a time. Do not crowd. Cook in batches of 8 to 10 until deep golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Regulate heat as necessary to maintain temperature. Don’t let temperature go over 375 degrees. Cut in half diagonally and serve warm with a Chinese mustard for dipping and one of the soy-sauce based dipping sauces listed above. Cutting the rolls in half diagonally facilitates absorption of the sauce into the filling when the roll is dipped. Also it makes the rolls go farther and be easier for people to handle at a party etc. Cooled rolls can be reheated at 350 degrees for 10 minutes wrapped in foil.,

instructions, 1. To make meat:
2. Combine marinade. Marinate pork at least 3 hours or overnight.
3. Cooking methods:
4. a) place meat on a roasting pan with a rack -- with the pan below filled with water and roast at 350 F until done (turn over half way through) OR.
5. b) cook in a crock pot with 3 cups of water for 1 hour on high and then 7 hours on low or until it flakes apart (this is the method I have used) OR.
6. c) you could try grilling or broiling the meat but it might lack some of the moisture that the other two methods will give you.
7. To make filling:
8. Sauté ginger in hot peanut oil stirring constantly for about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and mix with hoisin chili paste green onions and meat. Let cool.
9. To make dough:
10. Mix yeast sugar and warm water; let proof (sit and rise) for about 10 minutes.
11. Place flours and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook if available. (This can also be done by hand).
12. Add yeast mixture. Knead until homogeneous and dough forms a ball.
13. Let rise in a cool place to minimize air bubbles about 15 minutes.
14. Portion dough into 16 balls flatten them and place a small amount of filling into the center of each.
15. Pinch back to close and form a ball shape.
16. Place balls on lightly oiled piece of parchment or waxed paper (oiled plastic wrap would probably work too). Let proof 15 minutes or until double in size.
17. Place in a covered steamer and cook for 8-10 minutes.
18. Eat now or cool completely and freeze in ziplock bags (to reheat: steam 10 minutes).
19. Enjoy the fruits of your labor!,

3. Filling:
4. Blanch the leaves of the cabbage (or bok choy) briefly in boiling water.  Remove and cool in water.  Mince finely strain and squeeze out all the water as dry as possible. Mix the greens with the other meat filling ingredients until well combined.
5. Roll out the dough into little circles roughly the size of your palm.  Wrap one tablespoon of filling inside each piece of dough.  (The tricky part is to get it to look pretty : Pinch the tops together tightly on top over lapping to close the tops together.).
6. Allow the filled rolls to rise the second time for 40 minutes.
7. Bring water to a boil in a steamer arrange the buns on the steamer.  It helps if you use pieces of parchment paper on the bottoms of the buns (like store bought buns) or the old method is to use some cabbage or leafy vegetables and line the entire steamer so the steam still goes right through yet the buns won't stick to the steamer).  Steam for 6 -8 minutes over high heat.,

4. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok and then stir-fry the pork and prawn mixture for about 2 or three minutes.
5. Add the remaining filling ingredients including the mushrooms. Stir until the mixture boils and thickens. Remove and cool (overnight works best. Store in the refrigerator until ready to be used.
6. FOR THE DUMPLINGS:  Dissolve the 1/2 cup sugar and water in a saucepan. Add the glutinous rice flour. You will need to stir vigorously to blend. It is important that this is done energetically and quickly.
7. Transfer the dough to a floured board (use rice flour) and knead lightly to a smooth silky dough. Use a very generous amount of rice flour. The dough is very soft and sticky- you cant have too much flour. Any excess flour can be dusted off when the dumpling is completed.
8. Shape the dough into a long roll (sausage) and cut it into 24 pieces. Cover the dough with a damp tea-towel.
9. Flatten each piece of dough with your hand or use a rolling pin. Form a flat circle about 6 centimetres (roughly 2 inches) in diameter.
10. Into each round -place a heaped spoonful of the cooled filling mixture into the centre. Fold the dough over in half (now shaped of a semi-circle) and pinch the edges to seal. Repeat until all 24 dumplings are made.
11. TO COOK: Roll each dumpling in sesame seeds and deep fry them  in a moderate heat until they turn a golden brown. This should only take a few minutes. The dumplings will float to the top when they are cooked.

3. Divide pork mixture into 32 pieces. Roll into balls then roll balls in rice. Put balls in parchment-lined steamers (see How to Steam Dim Sum below). Cook until rice is tender and pork is cooked about 10 minutes. Serve immediately.
4. How to Steam Dim Sum: Measure your steamer basket and choose a pot with a diameter at least 2 inches wider. To keep dumplings from sticking cut a circle of parchment paper 1 inches smaller in diameter than the basket (so steam can flow up around the edges) and fit it inches Pour enough water into pot to come 1 inches up side and bring to a boil over high heat. Fill basket with dim sum first then set it in the pot. Cover and cook adding hot water as needed.,

name, Sha Cha Tofu W- Green Beans and Onions, 
cuisine, Asian >> Chinese and Mongolian >> Chinese, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. At least a day before preparing drain tofu and wrap each block in 2 paper towels.  Place them in a zippered bag side by side with a weight on top of them.  I used an unopened half gallon carton of OJ laid on its side.  Over the course of the 24 hours I discarded the wet paper towels and re-wrapped the blocks of tofu 4 times.  The last paper towels were only damp when I discarded them.
2. Cut the brick of tofu once along each of its two longer faces splitting each face in half.  Then cut the largest face five times (perpendicular to your first cut on that face).  You should yield 20 blocks from each brick.
3. Heat a pot of oil or preheat your deep fryer to 400°.
4. While your oil is heating slice onions into 1/4" thick half rounds and in a bowl combine the sha cha sauce soy sauce rice wine sugar & salt.  Stir until the salt and sugar are dissolved.  NOTE:  The sha cha sauce I use settles in the jar so  I must stir it before measuring to have a consistent sauce.
5. Heat your wok and add your oil.  Depending on how hot your wok is and how quickly you can add all the ingredients in the next step you may want to vary the order in which you add them.  At the same time in your deep fryer begin deep frying the blocks of tofu.
6. In the wok - add the garlic onion then red pepper.  If the oil is too hot or if I don't think I can get to the onions quickly enough I add the onions first.  The reason being that the garlic burns very quickly in very hot oil and ruins the dish once it burns but the quick addition of the onions will lower the temperature enough as not to burn the garlic. So add those ingredients according to your situation.  Adding the red pepper first to hot oil may create a smoke that will close off your air passageways.  Don't ask me how I know this.  Suffice it to say that the last time it happened people arriving at my house and walking up the driveway were gasping for air once the smoke hit them.  It was far worse in the kitchen.
7. Stir the onion/garlic/pepper mixture.  Remember to check in on the tofu and shake the basket of tofu so that the blocks don't stick together while frying.
8. Once the onions begin to become translucent (after 5 minutes or so) add the frozen green beans and water.  Cover and steam for 2-4 minutes.
9. Ideally the tofu will be a light golden color by the time your beans have steamed for a couple of minutes.  Remove the tofu from the deep fryer and shake off the excess oil.
10. Add the deep fried tofu to the wok along with the mixture of sha cha & soy sauces.
11. Toss to mix and coat.  Cook for a minute or two to heat the sauce.  Serve over rice (optional).  Without the rice this dish would serve 3-4 not the 6 listed.,

4. Shake to mix thoroughly.
5. First-Stage Frying: Heat 1-2 inches (24 fl oz should give you sufficient depth) of peanut oil in a wok on medium high heat (350-400 degrees F).
6. Fry the chicken in small batches 4 to 5 minutes just long enough to cook the chicken through.
7. Remove the chicken to absorbent paper and allow to stand (this step can be performed well in advance along with the sauce mixture with both refrigerated).
8. After all the chicken is cooked dump the peanut oil into a heat-proof bowl (metal Pyrex etc).  (You need a little oil for the next step; and the rest of the oil can be used again next time you make General Tso's.).
9. Second-Stage Frying: Put a tablespoon of the peanut oil back in the wok.
10. Return the chicken to the wok and stir-fry until the pieces are crispy brown.
11. The Generals Favorite Sauce: Shake up the sauce mixture one last time and add it to the wok tossing the chicken and sauce over the heat until the sauce thickens (1-2 minutes).
12. Serve immediately.,

instructions, 1. Fry the ground beef with the salt and pepper and garlic powder until the meat is completely browned.
2. Make sure to add a lot of the salt and pepper and garlic powder.
3. This needs to have a strong flavor because you'll be frying it with other ingredients.
4. Don't put so much in that you can't eat it but you want to really taste it.
5. Once you are done getting the flavor right get a LARGE bowl and put the shredded cabbage and carrots in it and then add the ground beef on top.
6. Mix together completely and let sit for about 15 minutes.
7. I do that so the mixture will soften and I can roll them more easily.
8. Check the mixture after it sits to make sure the flavor is still there and really stands out.
9. If not add more of the salt and pepper and garlic powder.
10. It's really up to your taste buds but this is what I've done and I get RAVE reviews.
11. Heat up your oil for frying in a deep fryer.
12. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for how much oil to add but always make sure you don't fill it to the top so you don't get hurt.
13. I usually only fill about half of the fryer.
14. Crack an egg into a small bowl to make a wash for sealing the egg roll wraps.
15. Take a wrap and put about 1-2 teaspoons of the meat mixture onto the wrap.
16. Wrap the roll as shown on the package remembering to seal with the egg wash.
17. I try to wrap my rolls tightly but I don't always do that so well.
18. Once you are done wrapping place the egg rolls carefully into the oil about 2-3 at a time.
19. Cook them until they are blond in color.
20. Don't let them get too dark.
21. Take them out and let drain on paper towels.
22. You're done! I serve mine with Grey Poupon for dipping. yummy!
23. Others might enjoy soy sauce! These also freeze very well that is of course if you have any left! I make a bunch for myself and have them for lunch.
24. Just pop them in the microwave for about 1 minute and you're done.,

instructions, 1. Combine all ingredients in small airtight container. Store in a cool dry place.
2. My Note:   * 1/2 teaspoons salt * 1/4 teaspoons ground white pepper Dont worry about these two ingredients as they are both to taste and are only needed when you are adjusting seasoning to taste. White pepper has a very strong and overpowering flavor. I would even omit the white pepper entirely since this is a -5- spice.
3. *I was told this is a Great formula by a frind Who is a Cantonese who used to own a Chinese restaurant in Sydney Australia. She married an Anglican. Knowledge is transferrable so is skill. Congratulation for such great effort. No one defines formula in food. But she testify this formula is genuine and popularly used. Individual variations are always present some add MSG some fry the Szechwan peppercorn powder more some dry fry the anise seeds powder more to give more fragrance etc. Salt & pepper spice simply means add salt and white pepper. Completely agree.
4. I needed 5 spice powder and didn't have it at home. This recipe is excellent. It was used to coat walnuts for an Asian salad. I loved the seasoned walnuts so much I ate them straight and am now going to make them for 5 holiday parties we are attending.,
