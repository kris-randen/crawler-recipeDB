6. Once the squash is done pull out of the oven  it will be really hot so carefully flip over each half so that it can cool for a couple of minutes.  Once the squash is cool enough to handle use a fork to  pull the strings of squash from the skin and put into a greased 13x9 casserole dish.  Season the squash liberally with salt pepper and a little more Italian seasoning and toss well.  Spread the ricotta mixture evenly over the top of the squash and then pour the sauce over all.   Break up the fresh mozzerella into small pieces and distribute evenly over the top and sprinkle with the parmesan.  Reduce oven heat to 350 degrees and bake casserole for 30 minutes till cheese is golden brown and bubbly.
7. Serve with a green tossed salad and some crusty whole grain bread. The whole family will enjoy and not even realize they are devouring something healthy!,

instructions, 1. Roast 2 small acorn squash at 350 degrees farenheit for 45 mins or until tender. Allow to cool to room temperature or until cool enough to handle.
2. Meanwhile chop/dice the yellow and red peppers as well as the mushrooms and onion. Preheat a large skillet add the olive oil and saute diced veg until tender.
3. Add the diced tomatoes to a blender and blend until smooth then add blended tomatoes as well as tomato paste to the sauteing vegetables. Add the italian seasoning garlic powder salt and pepper then taste and adjust seasoning accordingly. Add balsamic vinegar then taste again and adjust as needed.  Cover and let simmer over low heat.
4. Finely chop spinach and add to a medium bowl. Mix in 2 eggs ricotta cheese salt and pepper. Set aside.
5. In medium bowl add 2 1/2 cups flour and mashed squash (or 1 1/2 cups canned pumpkin) mix until it starts to pull together then turn out onto floured work surface and knead in enough of the remaining flour to make dough stiff but plyable. You want to be able to roll this thin without being too wet to where your hands will go through it but you don't want it to be too dry to where it is going to crumble apart either.
6. Divide dough in half and roll into 2 equal sized rectangles. Fold one of the rectangles of dough loosely in half then in half again and set aside. On the remaining rectangle of dough drop filling by teaspoonfuls about an inch apart.
7. Make an eggwash by beating one egg in a small bowl. Use a pastry brush to brush egg into visible surface of dough (in between each pile of filling and around the outside edges). Unfold second rectangle of dough and place directly on top of the first one being careful not to drag it across the filling piles. Smooth out any air bubbles and gently press seams between each pile of filling. Cut ravioli apart and use a fork to pinch edges together to seal.
8. Drop one at a time into gently boiling water being careful not to drop directly on top of each other to prevent sticking. When they start to float (which won't be long) simmer another 1-2 minutes then remove with a slotted spoon. Cook in 2-3 batches if necessary.
9. Serve sauce over ravioli and enjoy with freshly grated parmesan.,

instructions, 1. Continually whisk balsamic vinegar and brown sugar in a stainless-steel pot over medium heat.  When mixture begins to simmer reduce heat enough to maintain a low simmer.  Reduce to about half to thicken to a light syrup.  Inexpensive brands may require additional reduction to thicken.
2. When removed from heat mixture is still very hot.  Please be careful and prevent touching or splashing.  Cool some of the mixture and test for sweetness adding some additional brown sugar or up to a tablespoon of honey to taste.
3. Remove from heat.  Be careful not to over thicken.  Glaze will thicken further as it cools.
4. Options although this basic glaze recipe is delicious on its own you can add other flavors such as 1-tablespoon honey fig extract or strained fig preserves pomegranate reduction pure cherry syrup fruit liquor.  Honey or syrups can also be added after pan is removed from heat.

instructions, 1. Steam spinach for a few minutes shock in ice water drain squeeze water out and chop.
2. Mix spinach and half of the mozzarella into the ricotta cheese.  Add the eggs and parsley and mix well.  Saute  the shallots in the oil cool down and add to the filling mixture.  Season with finely ground black pepper and nutmeg.  Put the filling into a gallon-sized baggie and chill the filling for an hour.
3. Spread 2 cups of your favorite marinara sauce (use recipe #443284) (Steam the spinach lightly plunge into ice water to preserve the color drain well and squeeze dry. Chop it finely.) into the bottom of a 13   x 9  baking pan which is greased or sprayed.  If your sauce is thick you can thin it with a little bit of water. (refined sauce works best rather than chunky sauce).
4. Fill the uncooked manicotti tubes with the ricotta mixture.  Cut a corner of the plastic bag off and squirt the filling from the center of the tube to the outside.  Do it this way from both ends of the tube to make it full and trust me it's easier this way.
5. Line the filled tubes up in your pan.  Cover with remaining sauce and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.
6. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap (I use Stretch-tite which works very well).  Put in the refrigerator overnight.
7. Next day leave the manicotti on the counter to come up to room temperature about 1 or 2 hours.  Pre-heat the oven to 350*.  Leave the plastic wrap on the manicotti and wrap over it with foil.  I wrap the entire pan in foil and then seal it up tight.  Pop it in the oven for an hour.  Check the temperature with your instant read thermometer to see if it's 190 -   200 degrees.
8. Remove it from the oven and if you like the top a little crunchy just unwrap the foil and the plastic and pop it back into the oven for 10 or 15 minutes. Rest for 15 minutes before serving.
9. There ya go!  Mangia!,

instructions, 1. Tagliatelle.
2. The process of making fresh tagliatella is simple but at the same time it needs attention and much love. Put 200g of “00” flour on a wooden board make a hole in the centre and break the eggs in add a drop of olive oil and a pinch of salt and with a fork then break up the eggs slowly pulling down the flour a bit at a time. Once this step is complete we move on to the “massage” phase. Knead the dough with your hands until it becomes soft and compact and stretches when pulled once it reaches the right consistency leave it to rest for around 30 min in a cool place.
3. Now comes the most delicate phase of the making of the pasta (in the local “Cossignanese” dialect this is called the “pannella”) it is made by rolling using a long wooden pasta rolling-pin to stretch out the dough until it becomes 2mm thin. Use a little four to prevent the dough sticking to the board or rolling pin. It is important to keep all parts of the dough at a similar thickness as it thins out. Start with your hands near the centre of the rolling pin and move them to the ends of the pin as you roll so as to keep an even pressure over the whole area of the dough. Occasionally lift the dough and dust with flour underneath to ensure it does not stick. A special long thin rolling-pin is required to avoid creating flat spots on the pasta as the area of the dough increases.
4. At this point the dough can lightly rolled up and cut with a knife to create thin strips 3/4m for “maccheroncino” and 7/8mm for “tagliatella” strips. The pasta is ready to use and since it is fresh it takes only a couple of minutes in boiling water to reach the “al dente” (to the tooth) stage. It can be topped with any suitable sauce: perfect is a “ragu” meat sauce but equally good is a mushroom or fish sauce.
5. Ragu.
6. In Cossignano the ragu is made with ground beef and pork. This is not “mince” that you might buy in a supermarket. In Italy we buy a piece of meat and ask the butcher to grind it for us so we know exactly what we are eating. Fry a finely chopped onion in a little olive oil when it becomes soft and translucent add a diced carrot and a chopped stick of celery and cook together for a few minutes. Add 200 grams ground beef and 100 grams of minced pork brown it with the addition of a glass of red wine. As soon as the meat is browned add salt and pepper to taste pop in a parmesan rind and pour about a quart of passata di pomodoro – pureed tomatoes. Cook for about two hours covered over low heat stirring occasionally to prevent the sauce from sticking to the bottom.,

instructions, 1. Split each chicken breast through the middle to make 2 pieces. ( I used tenders that were on sale and pounded them out. PERFECT portion size!) Place plastic wrap over them and pound each one flat using a meat tenderizer/mallet until they are about a quarter inch thick. Season with a good amount of salt and pepper on both sides of each piece. (I often use lemon pepper instead also adding some to the cornstarch.) Place some flour on a plate and and dredge each piece of chicken in it. ( I use cornstarch. GLUTEN FREE and gives a nicer crisp IMO ).
2. Heat the oil over medium-high heat and when the oil is hot fry each piece of chicken for 3-4 minutes on each side until they are golden brown (this may require you to do this in 2 batches). Remove chicken and place them on your serving platter covering them with foil. Delicately pat off any residual oil with paper towels.
3. Reduce the heat to medium and add butter and mushrooms. Saute mushrooms for 4-5 minutes seasoning them with salt and pepper lightly. Add marsala wine dry white wine cream and chicken stock. Allow the liquid to reduce slightly; approximately 3-4 minutes. When desired consistency is obtained pour mushrooms and sauce over finished chicken. Serve with a side salad or if you aren't intolerant on a 1 cup bed of your favorite whole grain pasta. Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Use the refrigerated pre-mixed dough for No-Knead Flatbreads Recipe #387518.
2. Prepare 2 large baking sheet pans with parchment or Silpats set aside.
3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
4. Remove the Olive Oil Flatbread dough (Recipe #387518) from the refrigerator. Lighly dust the surface with flour and cut off a 1 pound (grapefruit size) piece.
5. With lightly floured hands quickly shape dough into a ball by streching the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides rotating the ball a quarter turn as you go.
6. On a lightly floured board flatten the dough with hands and rolling pin into a 1/4 inch thick rectangle dusting with minimal flour if necessary to keep dough from sticking to the rolling pin. If difficulty is experienced in rolling out the dough allow it to rest for a few minutes. I've found that pulling the dough with my hands works best.
7. Spread the sauce on the dough then cheese and top with meat leaving some of the cheese exposed so that it can help hold the roll together as it bakes.
8. Starting with the long end roll the dough into a log.
9. NOTE:   Cut only the number of pieces you want to bake.   The rest can be wrapped and stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or can be frozen for up to 2 weeks.
10. Using kitchen shears cut the dough into 1/2 inch pieces.
11. Place them on the prepared sheet leaving plenty of space for them to expand when they bake.

3. Bring sauce to a boil.  Simmer 2-3 hours to mix the flavors.
4. NOTE: This can also be made by placing everything in your slow cooker and simmering all day.  This is how I made it.  I would recommend sauteing the onions and garlic first. A triple batch filled my BIG (6 qt I think) crockpot.
5. TO FREEZE:  Let sauce cool to room temperature then pour into a labeled freezer bag.  Seal trying to get rid of as much air as possible in the process and freeze flat.  You can freeze with meatballs in or without.
6. TO REHEAT: Thaw overnight in the fridge or in the microwave or in a bowl of warm water (still sealed in the bag) or just dump in a crockpot or pot on the stove frozen and warm gently.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
2. Bake potatoes until very soft on a bed of coarse salt in a baking dish about 45 minutes. (The salt keeps the potatoes from touching the dish and developing a hard spot.) Cool potatoes until warm then halve lengthwise and scoop out the flesh. Pass the flesh through a food mill or ricer or push it through a coarse sieve. You should have about 4 cups.
3. In a bowl combine potato egg yolks Parmesan salt pepper and nutmeg. Work the mixture with a wooden spoon until smooth. Add 1 cup of the flour and knead very gently patting and pressing the dough with your hands until all the flour is incorporated. Add some or all of the additional 1/4 cup flour if the dough feels too moist it should be soft but shouldn't stick to your hands. Transfer dough to a work surface and roll into a log about 3 inches in diameter. Cut the log into 8 equal pieces.
4. Give each piece a quarter-turn so that you are rolling the dough in a different direction then roll into ropes a generous 1/2-inch in diameter as if making breadsticks. Flour the ropes generously and then cut crosswise at 1/2-inch intervals. You can shape the gnocchi on a ridged butter paddle or on the back of a fork or you can cook them as is. Let them dry at room temperature for at least 20 minutes before cooking.
5. Heat a large saute pan over high heat. When hot add oil and then sprinkle in the mushrooms. Don't stir! Let the mushrooms sizzle and caramelize for 7 to 8 minutes. Stir and season with salt and pepper. Add garlic and cook stirring for about 1 minute to release its fragrance. Add the rosemary and shallot and cook for about a minute. Cook briefly to release their fragrance then add tomato and red wine and simmer until almost evaporated. Add the broth or water. Simmer until slightly reduced 4 to 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and stir in the butter. Sprinkle with the parsley and keep warm.
6. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi. They are usually done about 2 minutes after they float to the surface but test 1 to be sure. Lift them out with a skimmer and transfer to a large platter. Pour the warm sauce over the gnocchi. Grate Parmesan over the top and serve immediately.,

instructions, 1. In a large skillet heat the olive oil. When almost smoking add the onion and garlic and sauté over medium heat until the onions become very soft about 8 minutes. Then add the chopped celery and carrot. Cook for 5minutes stirring vegetables to coat them well.
2. Raise heat to high and add ground beef a large pinch of salt and a few grindings of pepper. Crumble the meat with a fork stir well and cook until the beef has lost its raw red color about 10 minutes.
3. Add milk and simmer gently stirring frequently until it has bubbled away completely.
4. Add the wine and simmer until it has evaporated then add the tomatoes and stir thoroughly to coat all ingredients well. Add the parsley and basil. When the tomatoes begin to bubble turn the heat down so that the sauce cooks at the laziest of simmers with just an intermittent bubble breaking through to the surface. Cook uncovered for 3 hours or more stirring occasionally. While the sauce is cooking you are likely to find that it begins to dry out and the fat separates from the meat. To keep it from sticking add 1/2 cup of water whenever necessary. At the end however no water at all must be left and the fat must separate from the sauce. Taste and correct for salt.
5. Toss with cooked drained pasta adding the tablespoon of butter and serve with freshly grated Parmesan on the side.,

instructions, 1. At least a day before serving-  Cut bread in half horizontally; hollow out some of the excess bread to make room for the filling.  Spread each piece of bread with equal amounts of the olive salad including oil.
2. Top the bottom half (over the olive salad) with layers of the meats and cheeses in any order.  I like to layer a meat then a cheese.
3. Put the two halves together and wrap tightly.  Refrigerate for several hours or preferably overnight; this allows the flavors to mingle and the olive salad to soak into the bread.  I turn the loaf over several times while in fridge so the oil evenly soaks both top and bottom of sandwich.
4. To serve- cut into serving sizes; this sandwich is so fat you may need to put toothpicks in it to hold it together!  It is extremely filling; a little bit goes a long way.  Easily serves 8-10 hungry people.,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 375. Grease a large baking sheet with a little of the olive oil.
2. Place tomatoes in pan cut side down and drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until they start to char and shrivel (no need to turn over) 40-50min. Let cool on the pan a bit.
3. For the Polenta: Boil the milk and water together.
4. Whisk in the cornmeal and salt. Turn down the heat and stir constantly until the polenta is suspended in the water and no longer settles to the bottom of the pot. It's done in about 15 minutes (still stirring often) but is supposedly even better if you cook it for about an hour - I wouldn't know I'm always too impatient :).
5. Take of the stove and stir in the butter or olive oil and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese.
6. Place a mound of polenta in the center of each plate. Top with goat cheese roasted tomato basil and pine nuts.,

instructions, 1. To make the Slow Roasted Cherry Tomatoes & Arugula:
2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
3. Put the tomatoes on a rimmed cookie sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and a pinch of salt. Roast for about 30 minutes (depending on your oven they may be done in as little as 20 minute or as long as 40 min.) stirring occasionally until the tomatoes are split and blistered. Which means they are super sweet.
4. While the chicken is cooking toss the arugula with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil the vinegar and pinch of salt. Fold the tomatoes into the arugula.
5. Chicken:
6. Put the chicken breasts in between two sheets of wax paper and pound them with a mallet until they are very very thin - you should be able to almost see through them - about 1/6 inch thick.
7. Mix the oregano salt and pepper into the bread crumbs or panko and set on a plate.
8. Put the milk into a shallow bowl.
9. Dip each chicken piece into the milk and then dredge in the bread crumbs. You should have a thin even coating.
10. Heat 1/4 cup of olive oil in a large nonstick skillet. Cook the chicken for about 4 minutes on the first side or until evenly browned and crisp. Flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes or until the other side is browned and crisp and the chicken is firm to the touch.
11. Place a piece of chicken on each plate and mound a handful of the arugula mix over each piece.,

instructions, 1. Prepare Chicken Cutlets - Defrost and rinse the chicken. Wrap the chicken in plastic wrap and pound it until it is uniformly thin - about   1.5 centimeters. Then take your cleaned sage leaves and place them on the chicken. Stack the chicken so that the sage is touching both sides. Re-wrap the chicken and set aside.
2. Prepare the Veggies for the Sauce - Dice the onions and peppers and put them into a saute pan with about 1/2 of the olive oil (approx 6 tbs). Heat them stirring occasionally over a medium low heat until the onions are translucent and the peppers begin to get soft.
3. Boil the Water for the Linguine - Fill your pasta pot with water generously salt the water and turn on the heat!
4. Press the Garlic Clove -  Into the Veggies which should now be soft and very slightly browning. Add the remaining oil in with the veggies which are now well sauted in your saute pan.
5. Cook the Chicken - Move all of the veggies to the sides of the saute pan making room for the cutlets. Remove the cutlets from the plastic and place them into the hot oil with the sage side down. You don't want the veggies to brown a lot so move them around and even pile them on top of the chicken so they don't over cook. Increase the heat under the pan to Medium High. When the chicken is almost cooked all the way through flip it over to finish it on the other side. Don't over cook! When the chicken is cooked through remove the chicken and the sage from the pan and set aside. Remove most of the sage from the chicken.
6. Add Can of Crushed Tomatoes to Veggies- Reduce the heat under the Saute Pan to medium low again because the oil should be really hot now. Stir the crushed tomatoes around with the oil and the veggies. Add the nutmeg cinnamon brown sugar and a dash of the vanilla extract. Stir and then cover.
7. Cook Pasta - Add your linguine to your boiling water. It should cook for about 7 - 10 minutes.
8. Attend to the Red Sauce - while the pasta is cooking check the sauce to make sure it is bubbling and to stir it often. Add salt and pepper to taste.
9. Add the Chicken to the sauce for the last two minutes to heat it up. The chicken should just lay on top.
10. Plate the pasta. Smother it with the red sauce and place the sage chicken on top.
11. ENJOY! All of the seasonings and the oil content can be adjusted.,

instructions, 1. Combine the rye flour all-purpose flour and yeast in a large bowl. In another bowl beat together the butter egg yogurt salt sugar caraway seeds and fennel seeds.
2. Using a wooden spoon beat 1 cup of warm (110°) water into the four and yeast mixture in the bowl then beat in the butter-egg-caraway seed mixture. Stir for 30 seconds adding a little warm water if the dough is dry or a little all-purpose flour if it is very sticky (NOTE: rye doughs are always stickier and harder to work than wheat doughs so be patient and don't add too much flour simply to prevent sticking or the bread will too be dense).
3. Turn the shaggy dough out onto the counter; knead 8 to 10 minutes sprinkling with a whisper of all-purpose flour if the dough sticks to your hands or the counter. The dough should be smooth supple and elastic when you are done kneading.
4. Shape into a ball. Place in a lightly floured bowl and turn to coat lightly with the flour on all sides; cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rise at room temperature for 1 hour or until doubled in volume.
5. Preheat the oven with a baking stone in it to 425°.
6. Sprinkle the counter with the stone-ground whole wheat flour. Turn the dough out onto the counter over the flour. Cut into 2 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 10-inch-long x 3-inch-wide loaf. Place on a cornmeal-dusted tray about 4 inches apart cover with a towel and let rest 30 minutes.
7. Uncover the loaves. Transfer to a cornmeal-dusted baking peel and slash the top of each loaf diagonally 3 times with a sharp knife or blade.
8. Dust the top with a light sprinkling of flour (the goal is to make the flour form a coating on the dough not to be incorporated in the dough).
9. Transfer directly to the baking stone; bake 30 minutes or until golden-brown and the bottom sounds hollow when thumped misting 3 times with water during the first 10 minutes of baking (be sure to close the oven immediately upon misting the loaves).
10. Remove to a rack (to keep crust crips) and cool to room temperature.,

instructions, 1. Mix the eggs and meat thoroughly to evenly distribute.  Add the Pecorino Romano cheese breadcrumbs chopped parsley garlic salt and pepper.
2. Mix thoroughly together by hand in order to combine all the ingredients.
3. Then start making your balls. Remember to compress the ball with your hands so they are very compact and will not crack. This is important because a ball with any cracks or not compact enough may break during the shallow frying stage.
4. Now heat the olive oil in a large frying pan and fry the meatballs over medium heat until golden brown. If the meatballs stick to the bottom of the pan you may use a non-stick frying pan or you can fry the meatballs two at a time and keep rolling then in the hot oil.
5. Place the meatballs on a new clean plate or a tray.
6. Do not discard the olive oil but filter it into a small bowl in order to remove the residue created when frying the meatballs.  Return filtered oil to the pan heat and add the chopped onion and garlic.  Sweat off for about 2 minutes.
7. Add the tomato puree and cook on medium heat for about 3 minutes stirring constantly.
8. Add 150 ml (5 fl oz or 5/8 cup) of hot water to the frying pan and cook for one minute stirring. The gravy is done so remove the pan from the heat and set aside.
9. In a large saucepan (a casserole would do the job) add the chopped tomatoes and cook on medium heat for 5 minutes.
10. Then add the gravy (tomato puree mixture) from the frying pan.  Add the reserved browned meatballs.  Cover with hot water. In my case I used a very large saucepan so to cover the meatballs I needed 2 ½ cups of water. A slightly smaller saucepan would probably require less water I would say 1 2/3 cups.
11. Add the chopped parsley a pinch each of salt and pepper.   Mix thoroughly but carefully with a wooden spoon so as to not break the meatballs. Now cook on medium heat for about 15 minutes.
12. Cover (leaving one side of the lid slightly open) and simmer for about 2 ½ hours stirring every 20 minutes to prevent sticking on bottom of the pan.  Also when doing that turn the meatballs so the part that was face up will get the next 20 minutes cooking facing the bottom and keep going like that until the end. After 1 ½ hours simmering check for seasoning; usually you need to add some salt.
13. Serve the meatballs over al dente pasta and use the red sauce from the pan to coat the pasta. Finally sprinkle with freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese (alternatively Parmesan cheese).,

3. Place one of the chicken cutlets on top of 3 or 4 prosciutto slices.  Fold the upper and lower edges of the prosciutto slices in and over the chicken cutlet.  The cutlet will be partially covered by the prosciutto.  Flip the cutlet over and it will be totally covered.  Repeat with all 4 cutlets. (That seemed like a lot of work to me.  I cut a pocket in the chicken cutlets and inserted diced prosciutto.  Turned out just fine.).
4. Break eggs into a wide shallow bowl and beat well.
5. Place enough flour to dust the chicken in another wide shallow bowl.
6. Dip each cutlet into the egg coating well.  Let excess egg drip off and then dip lightly in flour.

11. When chicken is done remove cutlets to broiler pan.
12. Top each piece with one tablespoon (or more) of parmesan and then a slice of mozzarella.

15. Return pans to high heat and add 1/4 cup marsala and 1/4 cup chicken stock to each pan.
16. Boil quickly until only 3 or 4 tbl of liquid is left in each pan.
17. Turn heat to low and place 2 tbl of butter in each pan (again I used less).  Swirl with a whisk until a creamy brown sauce is formed.

16. Put your water on to boil for the spaghetti and add the 1/2 lb spaghetti when the water comes to a rolling boil.
17. Some people like their pasta al dente but I wouldn't recommend it for this dish because you combine the sauce with the pasta once the spaghettini is drained.
18. Drain your spaghetti and add the sauce to the pasta.
19. Mix thoroughly and serve immediately.
20. The sauce is very versatile and can be used on any sort of pasta.
21. A friend of mine loved it with penne rigate and another one even preferred it over orzo pasta or as a sort of risotto.,

instructions, 1. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add a generous amount of salt then pasta to boiling water.
2. Fry bacon in large pan until crisp add pepper.
3. Once pasta is cooked to al dente lightly drain pasta (use a pasta cooker that you can pull the middle out and don’t drain it all the way or else use a “spider” or tongs – don’t dump the pasta into a colander! You need some of the cooking liquid for the sauce.) add pasta to bacon in pan.
4. Add egg yolks all at once break and start tossing with the pasta and bacon very quickly. If eggs start looking scrambled add more pasta water. Your finished dish should look like cream has been added but without needing to have added cream.
5. Add parmesan and toss well. Garnish with additional parmesan and pepper and serve immediately on warmed plates.,

2. Saute the onions in olive oil and butter over medium heat in a large skillet.
3. Add salt and cook stirring until they are limp.
4. Stir in vinegar and sugar and cook over a slightly lower heat until the vinegar has evaporated.
5. I caution you the escaping steam will take your breath away so stay well away from the skillet when possible but do perservere!
6. When vinegar has evaporated add cayenne or tabasco mix well and remove from heat.
7. The sauce should still retain the texture of the onions and yet retain enough moisture to be spoonable.
8. Cover and keep warm.
9. TUNA:
10. Over medium heat add olive oil and bay leaves to a skillet large enough to hold tuna steaks in one layer.
11. When the oil is warm not hot add tuna and salt and pepper to taste.
12. Saute 2-3 minutes per side but this will depend on thickness of steaks and your doneness preference-- we like ours on the rare side.
13. Raise heat add wine and cover pan a second or two just until the wine has stopped steaming.

cuisine, European >> Italian >> Italian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. METHOD Place the meat in a non-metallic bowl with 1 tbsp olive oil a clove of garlic the thyme and balsamic vinegar and mix well. Cover and leave in the fridge to marinate overnight.
2. Put 4 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan with the onion carrots celery mushrooms (if using) chilli and remaining garlic. Cover and cook over a low heat for 15-20 minutes stirring occasionally until all the contents have softened. Once the vegetables start to stick to the bottom of the pan set aside.
3. Remove the garlic and thyme from the marinated meat and discard. In another pan heat the remaining oil over a high heat add the meat and cook covered for 30-60 seconds. At this stage the game usually releases water – as soon as this happens drain the water and juices away. This will take the “gamey” edge off a little. You may need to repeat this procedure a few times until the meat is very dry. Season to taste and keep stirring.
4. Once the meat starts to stick to the pan add the cooked vegetables and wine and stir again. Now add the tomatoes and crumble in the stock cubes lower the heat and stir well until the cubes have dissolved. Cover and leave to simmer for 2 hours stirring occasionally. At the end of the process the sauce should be neither too stiff nor too runny. Add water or cook for slightly longer uncovered to achieve the right consistency.
5. Meanwhile make the pasta. Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the middle and add the eggs. Slowly mix the eggs into the flour using your fingertips until all the flour has been incorporated. Add a little water if the mixture is too hard or a little semolina flour if too soft. On a work surface lightly dusted with semolina flour (if necessary) knead the dough for a few minutes until smooth and elastic. Shape the dough into a ball wrap in cling film and leave it to rest in the fridge for 20 minutes.
6. To make the béchamel sauce melt the butter in a saucepan over a low heat. Take off the heat and stir in the flour a little at a time until you have a thick paste. Gradually add the milk stirring to incorporate each addition before adding the next. Add a pinch of salt and the nutmeg and then place over a medium heat and bring to the boil stirring constantly. Lower the heat and stir for 5 minutes then set aside to cool stirring occasionally.
7. Preheat the oven to 180°C/Gas mark 4.
8. Dust a work surface with semolina flour and roll out the pasta dough into a sheet about 1mm thick. Using a pastry cutter or one of your ramekins stamp out 24 circles of pasta.
9. Spoon a layer of the game sauce about 1cm deep into each ramekin. Place a disc of pasta over the sauce in each ramekin. Spoon another layer of game sauce on top then cover with béchamel. Repeat these layers (pasta meat sauce béchamel) at least twice more finishing with plenty of béchamel.
10. Sprinkle the pecorino on top of the dishes and place in the oven for 20 minutes or until the cheese has browned. Leave to rest for a few minutes before serving… Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Mix together the mashed potatoes and egg with a fork until it's well combined.
2. Add in most of flour and mix well until the flour is incorporated. Add enough additional flour to make a moist but firm dough - like home made play dough consistency.
3. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface knead and shape it into a ball. Divide the ball into 4 pieces.
4. Working with one piece at a time roll the dough out into a long strand about 1/2 inch wide in diameter. Try to get it as even as possible but it's okay if it's not perfect.
5. Use a dough scraper or knife to chop the strand of dough into 1 inch dumplings.
6. Once your dumplings are chopped use the back of a fork to gently press into the gnocchi and make some grooves.
7. Drop the formed gnocchi into gentle boiling salted water.  Cook them until they float about 3-4 minutes. Drain the gnocchi but do not rinse.
8. As the gnocchi is cooking sauté red bell peppers with 1-2 Tbsp olive oil.  Add the spinach and sun-dried tomato with another Tbsp olive oil cook until spinach is wilted.  Add the alfredo sauce and Italian seasoning stir until sauce is warm. If the sauce is too thick add 1 Tbsp milk and stir.  Cook turkey bacon at this time.
9. Mix the gnocchi with the alfredo sauce. Top gnocchi with crumbled goat cheese bacon and parsley and serve right away.,

5. Scatter garlic onion slices and basil on the pan with the tomatoes.  Sprinkle the kosher salt & crushed red pepper over all of the ingredients.
6. Drizzle the olive oil over everything more or less to taste.  I like to get a little olive oil on each tomato half.
7. Place in heated oven for 45-50 minutes.
8. About 15 minutes before sauce is done start cooking the angel hair pasta.  Angel hair cooks very fast so keep an eye on it.  When done drain and drizzle with olive oil so it doesn't stick together.
9. Back to the sauce!
10. When tomatoes begin to 'roast' or turn black it should be done.  Smash a garlic clove if unsure.  If soft it's done.
11. Remove from the oven let it cool for 5 minutes.
12. Remove sausage slices and set aside. Throw the remaining ingredients in a food processor and pulse until desired consistency. A blender can be used but should be done in small batches and for only a few seconds on 'chop' setting.
13. Pour the pasta into a large pretty bowl drizzle again with a little olive oil if desired. Add the sausage.   After processing the tomato mixture pour over the sausage and pasta.
14. Sprinkle with fresh grated parmesan.
15. Garnish with a sprig of basil.

instructions, 1. Over medium heat place olive oil in heavy pan (I like to use my small dutch oven with a lid) to heat. Add ground turkey and cook through crumbling as you go. Once the turkey is no longer pink add garlic and cook for 3 minutes stirring so as to not burn the garlic. Add the two packages of mushrooms breaking up any larger pieces- cook for 10 minutes. *This is a good time to get your pasta water boiling. Add the can of whole tomatoes to the turkey and mushrooms and crush in the pan. (I like to use a potato masher). Add the can of tomato paste and the italian seasoning. Stir it up and pop on the lid. Reduce the heat to low and let simmer for about 30 minutes- stirring occasionally. Flavor with salt and pepper to your liking and let it simmer for an additional 10 minutes or so without the lid on. Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment combine the water and yeast and let sit for 20 to 30 seconds to allow the yeast to dissolve and activate.
2. Dump the all-purpose flour whole wheat flour 2 teaspoons salt and the sugar onto the water and carefully turn the mixer on low.
3. Let the dough mix for about 30 seconds (to prevent the flour from flying out of the bowl turn the mixer on and off several times until the flour is mixed into the liquid and then keep it on low).
4. When the dough is still shaggy looking drizzle in 3/4 cup of the olive oil aiming it along the side of the bowl to keep it from splashing and making a mess.
5. With the mixer still on low knead the dough for 4-5 minutes or until it is smooth and supple.
6. The dough should be somewhat sticky but still smooth and have an elastic stretchy consistency.
7. If it is much stiffer than this mix in a few tablespoons water; if it is much looser than this mix in a few tablespoons of all-purpose flour.
8. **Alternatively combine the water and yeast in a large bowl and then add the other ingredients as directed and mix with a wooden spoon; once the oil is incorporated dump out the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 6-8 minutes or until smooth and supple**.
9. Lightly oil a large bowl; transfer the dough to the oiled bowl and turn the dough to coat it with the oil.
10. Cover the bowl with an oiled piece of plastic wrap or a lint-free damp cloth.
11. Place the bowl in a draft-free warm place (72 to 82 degrees F is ideal; an area near the stove or in the oven with only the pilot light on is good) for 2-3 hours.
12. The dough should rise until it is about double in bulk.
13. Once the dough has risen flour your hands and your work surface and turn the dough out of the bowl.
14. Gently stretch the dough into a rectangle about 10 by 15 inches.
15. Sprinkle the cornmeal onto a baking sheet to keep the dough from sticking and place the dough rectangle on the sheet.
16. Generously flour the top of the dough and then cover it loosely but completely with a piece of plastic wrap or lint-free damp cloth.
17. Place in a warm area for another hour or so or until the dough rises a bit and gets puffy and pillowy.
18. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat oven to 425°.
19. When the dough is ready remove the plastic wrap and dimple the dough all over using all ten fingers and firmly poking straight down into the dough all the way to the bottom.
20. Sprinkle the Parmesan evenly over the top drizzle evenly the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and then sprinkle evenly with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and the pepper.
21. Bake for 35-45 minutes or until completely golden brown on top and bottom.
22. Lift the dough and make sure the underside is browned before pulling it out of the oven or you will end up with soggy focaccia.
23. Let cool on the pan on a wire rack for about 30 minutes or until cool enough to handle then cut into serving pieces.
24. The focaccia will keep in a closed paper bag at room temperature for up to 3 days or tightly wrapped in two layers of plastic wrap in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.
25. If frozen thaw at room temperature for 3-4 hours and refresh in a 300° oven for 5 minutes or refresh directly from the freezer in a 300° oven for 12-15 minutes.,

instructions, 1. Reserve about 2/3 cup of shredded mozzarella and 1 cup of pasta sauce.
2. Brown ground beef sausage and onion adding crushed garlic when almost done. Stir in pasta sauce and all dried spices.
3. In a separate bowl combine cottage cheese mozzarella and 2 raw eggs.
4. Spread one-third of meat sauce in a lightly greased 13x9 inch baking dish. Follow with a layer of uncooked egg noodles. (Simply "dump" the noodles on top of the sauce and spread with your hand to create a thin even layer completely covering the sauce. Follow by a layer of the cheese mix and a layer of meat sauce. Repeat procedure until all ingridients are used.  Mix remaining pasta sauce with hot water 50/50. Slowly pour the mixture around inside edge of dish until the entire top layer of noodles is lightly covered with liquid. If necessary simply pour the mixture straight on top. Don't worry - it will cook away. Let stand for 5 minutes before putting the dish in the oven. Lightly sprinkle with mozzarella. Tightly cover baking dish with 2 layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil.
5. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven for 35-40 minutes. Uncover. If the egg noodles seem cooked (they're so small - you can just pinch one off and taste) -- top with the remaining mozzarella. Bake for an additional 10 minutes uncovered. Remove from oven and let stand 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
6. *** If you have no sausage on hand just substitute ground beef.  I've tried this recipe with ground turkey and even with a mix of browned ground beef and zucchini and it came out great.  If you prefer - you can broil the top mozzarella layer for a couple of minutes for extra sizzle.  Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Start the sauce:
2. Put oil in bottom of pre-heated sauce pot and let it heat up over medium heat. A nice heavy pot is best.
3. Add the onion green pepper bay leavesparsley and red pepper flakes and saute for for about 5 minutes or until the
4. onion is translucent.
5. Add the garlic and saute another minute or two don't let the garlic brown.
6. Add the first can of tomato sauce.
7. Place the 2 cans of stewed tomatoes in a food processor and blend till finely pureed add them to the pot.
8. Add the other three cans of sauce. I go slowly so that the sauce can slowly come to temperature without having to have the heat too high and risk burning it.
9. Add the can of diced tomatoes at the end.
10. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper.
11. Turn heat to low and keep your eye on the pot while you prepare the meatballs. Stir occassionally. Don't let it burn.
12. For the Meatballs:
13. Mix all the meatball ingredients together.
14. I usually let the milk sit on the breadcrumbs for a few minutes to moisten them before I start combining the mixture together.
15. They should be wet don't panic I let the mixture sit for about 10-15 minutes before I start forming the meatballs and it firms up a bit.
16. Form them into balls and place as many as you can into a glass pie plate without touching. I have two pie plates going.
17. Place the plate into your microwave yes the microwave and cook on high for 4 minutes. Grandma didn't do them this way but they turn out great and it saves a ton of time and it's a whole lot less mess.
18. Very carefully remove the pie plate from the oven and slide the contents into your simmering pot of sauce. No I do not drain any of the fat. Darn stuff tastes great!
19. Turn the heat up to about medium while you are adding the meatballs.
20. Have your next pie plate of meatballs ready to go into the microwave and repeat process until you are out of meat. I usually get 3-4 plates depends on how big you like your meatballs.
21. Once everything is in the pot and is bubbling turn the heat back down to low and.
22. Continue to very gently stir your pot of sauce with meatballs every now and then you don't want to burn your sauce but you don't want to break up the meatballs either.
23. Let simmer together for at least one hour. Longer won't hurt. Your entire neighborhood will smell amazing.
24. Serve over your favorite pasta or in your favorite recipe.
25. I store them seperately keep some in the fridge for another day and put the rest of the sauce in jars in the freezer. I freeze the meatballs individually and then store in bags. If you want to make more meatballs and freeze them before cooking you can. Just place on a cookie sheet and freeze then place in gallon size freezer bags. That way the next time you make the sauce it can be done and ready to eat in no time.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Remove giblets from cavity of chicken. Wash chicken thoroughly in cold water both inside and out. Remove any loose bits of fat. Pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. Sprinkle a generous amount of salt and black pepper on the chicken rubbing it with your fingers over all its body and into its cavity.
3. Wash the lemons in cold water and dry them with a towel. Soften each lemon by placing it on a counter and rolling it back and forth as you put firm downward pressure on it with the palm of your hand. Puncture the lemons in at least 20 places each using a sturdy round toothpick a trussing needle a sharp-pointed fork or similar implement.
4. Place both lemons in the bird's cavity. Close up the opening with toothpicks or with trussing needle and string; do not seal it completely airtight or the bird may explode. Run kitchen string from one leg to the other tying it at both knuckle ends. Leave the legs in their natural position without pulling them tight. If the skin is unbroken the chicken will puff up as it cooks and the string serves only to keep the thighs from spreading apart and splitting the skin.
5. Put the chicken into a roasting pan breast facing down. Arrange the carrots and potatoes around it. Place the pan in the upper third of the preheated oven. After 30 minutes stir the carrots and potatoes and turn the chicken over to have the breast face up. When turning it try not to puncture the skin. If kept intact the chicken will swell like a balloon which makes for an arresting presentation at the table later. Do not worry too much about it however because even if it fails to swell the flavor will not be affected.
6. Cook for 30 to 35 minutes more then turn the oven up to 400°F Stir the potatoes and carrots again ensuring they are covered with the chicken juice and cook for 20 minutes more. (Total cooking time should be 20 to 25 minutes per pound.).
7. Whether your bird has puffed up or not bring it to the table whole and leave the lemons inside until it is carved and opened. The juices that run out are perfectly delicious. Be sure to spoon them over the chicken slices. The lemons will have shriveled up but they still contain some juice; if you squeeze them they may squirt.,

instructions, 1. THE DAY BEFORE: Make sure all of your produce is very clean. Cut half of the scallions tops and bottoms lengthwise to form fringes leaving the very centers (about 1 1/2 inches) uncut and put them in the ice water. Slice the carrots into thin ribbons lengthwise and roll up into a tight 'coil' being sure not to break them and secure with tooth picks; put them into the ice water with the scallions.
2. Wrap 24 slices of prosciutto around 24 pieces of sharp provolone. Stuff the wrapped cheese into a cherry pepper which has been seeded and put the stuffed peppers back into the pickle brine. (You can do the stuffed cherry peppers several days ahead and let them hang out in the fridge - My brother Dave makes gallons of these stuffed peppers and gives them as gifts. You can also do this with cream cheese and it is fabulous.).
3. Line the rim of a very large platter with the romaine lettuce leaves letting them come over the edge of the platter. Spread the shredded ice berg lettuce on the platter. You will need the shredded lettuce to support the Tonno Cups.
4. MAKE TONNO CUPS: layer a slice of Capicola ham on top of a slice of salami on top of a slice of provolone and make a 'pleat' in the slices forming a cone or cup shape. Secure with a frilled toothpick so no one bites into the tonno cup and gets a nasty surprise. Put one tablespoon of tuna (tonno in Italian) into the center of the cup. Arrange the 24 cups around the edge of the platter supporting them with the shredded iceberg lettuce.  If you intend to use anchovies this would be the time to make a hole in the center of your shredded lettuce so you can put a ramekin in the center to hold those fuzzy little things. Use the best you can afford. Arrange the stuffed peppers around the platter.
5. Stuff the black olives with cream cheese and add them and the green olives to the platter. Stuff half of the celery with the remaining cream cheese and arrange them around the platter.
6. Score the cucumbers with a fork if you don't have a zester or channel knife. Arrange them on the platter. Scatter the artichoke hearts and mushrooms around.  Add the anchovies to the ramekin if you are going to use them.
7. Dry your scallions - surprise! don't they look cute? -  and unfurl your carrots and decorate the platter with them and the tomatoes and the rest of the ingredients as you have room for them.
8. PLEASE make this recipe your own by adding what you and your family like.  It is easy to scale down to individual proportions for small gatherings.
9. Pass some Italian bread (recipe #273358) red wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil and maybe some parmesan shavings. Or if you desire you can make a vinaigrette.,

instructions, 1. Preheat a 3-quart lidded sauté pan or pot over medium-high heat.
2. Drizzle in about 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Coat the pan with the oil and throw in the ground meat. With a wooden or plastic spatula break up the meat so it browns. This will take about 7-10 minutes depending on the meat you're using. If it's fatty you'll need to drain the grease.
3. Toss in the dried herbs and the onion and mix it all in well with the meat. Cook about 5 minutes until the onions are pliable; add garlic.
4. Stir cans of tomatoes and the puree well into the meat mixture. Bring to a gentle simmer give it one more good stir cover lower the heat and let all those ingredients get happy together. Let simmer for about 30 minutes (or even an hour if you have the time).
5. Two things to do while the sauce is coming together: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and fill a big pot with water and bring it to a boil. When you have about 10 minutes left on the sauce take a large pinch of salt and dump it into the boiling water along with a tablespoon of olive oil and finally the pasta. Cook the pasta about 3/4 of the time it says on the box so that it is very "al dente."
6. When there are just a few minutes left on the sauce pour in the sugar and the wine. Doesn't matter what kind of wine as long as it's red. Mix in these two ingredients and let the sauce cook a few more minutes while you drain the pasta.
7. After you've drained the pasta put it in a 3-quart (such as a 9-by-13-inch) baking dish and pour in as much of the sauce as you like. You will likely have leftover sauce – use it again for pasta or even with green beans. Be creative. Mix the sauce and pasta well and cover the top with the cheese. A nice sprinkling of dry oregano or basil will add taste and visual appeal.
8. Put the dish in the bottom rack of the oven and let it cook for 25 minutes or until the top is bubbly and just starting to brown.  Carefully remove the dish and set it aside. Thinly slice some fresh basil and set the table while the dish cools for 5 to 10 minutes.,

instructions, 1. SAUCE: Heat oil in large heavy pot (use a seasoned pot if you have one). Place the pork in the pot and brown until just about cooked.  Transfer pork to plate. Do the same with the sausage and transfer to plate. Leave fat in pot.  Add whole peeled garlic cloves cook until tender. Put garlic on plate with meat and stir in tomato paste until "saucy". Chop up tomatoes leaving the tomato juice in the cans (I use my chopper) and add them to the pot.
2. Then add 1/2 of one can of the juice to the pot. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add the meats and garlic to the sauce and bring to a boil. Turn down to low and cook for about 1 1/2 hours.  Leave the sauce on low and remove all the meat and garlic cloves.
3. Mix all ingredients for meatballs and shape into balls. Add to sauce turn up just a little higher than low and let cook the raw meatballs until they are done (1/2 hour) THATS IT!
4. Now this is an old recipe but I have seen it in the sopranos cookbook and this is a bit different.
5. I used this sauce to make the ziti al forno from the sopranos cookbook (Recipe #73939) and it was the most amazing thing I have ever eaten so I posted that too.,

instructions, 1. First make the polenta. Bring the chicken stock to a boil add the salt and gently whisk in the cornmeal. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the cornmeal thickens stirring frequently about 15-20 minutes. (Note: The exact ratio of stock to cornmeal you will need will vary depending on the coarseness of the cornmeal.
2. If you are worried start with 3 cups of stock and keep the other cup hot in a small saucepan and add until you have the consistency you desire.) Remove from the heat and add the butter stir well until melted. Lightly oil a baking dish and transfer the hot polenta to the baking dish. Spread evenly the polenta should be 1/2-3/4 inch thick. Refrigerate uncovered until firm about 2 hours.
3. When the polenta is firm transfer it to a cutting board. Slice the polenta into the desired sizes. I like to use a round pastry cutter to create round slices of polenta which looks nice but inevitably leads to waste - or what I like to call chef's treats. Cutting triangles would probably be just as visually appealing and less wasteful.
4. Slice the onion and peppers thin and then saute over medium heat in a couple tablespoons of olive oil about 25 minutes. The peppers and onions should be soft and caramelized.
5. While the onions and peppers are cooking slice the sausage links into 1 inch pieces and cook over medium-high heat until well browned on all sides. When the sausage is almost completely cooked through transfer it to the pan with the peppers and onions including most of the sausage fat that has rendered in the pan (try to reserve about a tablespoon in the pan) toss well and reduce the heat to keep warm while frying the polenta slices.
6. In the saute pan that the sausage was cooked in fry the polenta slices on medium-high heat until lightly golden and crispy about 4-5 minutes per side. If there isn't enough sausage fat to fry all of the slices use olive oil to finish frying.
7. Serve the sausage and peppers over the polenta slices.,

2. On a high heat warm a little more oil to the pot and add the garlic and onion. Saute until the onion is translucent.
3. Add the rice to the pot and stir to coat the grains with the oil and onion. Add wine and saffron. Stir to combine.
4. Add one cup of the stock and continually stir whilst bringing to the boil.
5. Turn down to a medium heat. When the liquid has almost all been absorbed add another cup of stock and keep stirring continuously.
6. Keep repeating step 5 until the rice is cooked. I find that I need to use six cups of stock but quantities can vary from person to person. The best technique (I find) is to taste the rice after four cups and keep checking after each cup you add after that.
7. When the rice is cooked and almost all liquid has been absorbed stir in the chicken and mushrooms. Remove from heat when the mushrooms are starting to look cooked.
8. Slowly add in the spinach and stir until the spinach has wilted. Add pepper to taste.

instructions, 1. In at least a 10 inch round pan  pat out pizza dough.  Spray pan first with butter flavored cooking spray.  Using a fork poke holes in dough.
2. Cook the chicken breasts first on a grill  about 10 minutes on a George Foreman grill.  Slice lengthwise and then chop into 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch pieces.
3. Barely saute the frozen spinach for two to three minutes in a skillet with just a touch of Olive Oil.   Set aside and drain in collander to remove excess moisture.
4. Sometimes I will precook the pizza crust for about 5 to 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  This will give you a crunchier crust.   Other times I just assemble the pizza and bake on a raw crust.
5. Layer the ingredients in this order and arrange artfully:
6. crust.
7. spinach.
8. chopped chicken.
9. dab or pour the Ranch Dressing on the chicken and spinach.
10. sprinkle with Parmesan Cheese.
11. If the crust is prebaked cook at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes.
12. If the crust is raw  bake at 375 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes total.
13. Always watch and smell the pizza so as not to over cook.  Some ovens are more accurate than others so your cooking time may vary a bit.
14. For Calzone follow all steps above except fold over half way  only do this with raw dough.   And cook at 350 for 40 to 45 minutes spray with cooking spray after folding over.
15. Enjoy and know that you can customize this recipe with pepper green peppers a little oregano  or a bit of chopped or mined garlic!   It is always your perogative to improvise and to experiment!,

Cook stirring for a couple of minutes before adding the carrot and celery then season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes on medium until soft and lightly golden. Add the browned veal the wine sage leaves and a quarter of a cup of water. When it comes to the boil reduce the temperature to a simmer cover and cook for about 35 minutes (you may need to add just a little more water if there is not enough liquid). If you are using fresh peas pod them and add them now. Otherwise continue to cook for another 10 minutes or until the veal has become meltingly tender adding the frozen peas for the last couple of minutes.
4. To serve: cook pasta in plenty of salted boiling water until al dente; drain and toss through the veal and pea ragu. Add a knob of butter and a tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately sprinkled with a little parsley and offer more grated Parmesan on the side.
5. Note: This sauce can be made one or two days ahead of time up to the point where you have added and cooked the peas. Then gently reheat and proceed as before.
6. If using fresh peas ensure you either pod them yourself or use ones that have been recently podded as they quickly become mealy.,

instructions, 1. Combine all ingredients (except the olive oil and wine) in a large mixing bowl.  Mix well.
2. To make the meatballs:  With damp hands take a portion of the ground beef mixture and roll between palms to form a 1-inch round ball that is firmly packed.   Repeat.  Cook's Tip:  If the ground beef mixture becomes too dry for the meatballs to properly stick together add a sprinkle of water to the mixture as needed.
3. Cook the meatballs one of two (2) ways:
4. a.  Grandma's way was to drop the hand rolled meatballs into boiling hot tomato sauce during the last 20-30 minutes of the sauce's cooking time.
5. b.  Another popular method in our family is to fry the meatballs.  Heat the olive oil in a wide heavy-bottomed skillet over a medium-high flame.   Add the meatballs but do not over-crowd the skillet - Cook in a single layer.  Cook for 10 or so minutes.  As meatballs are finishing add a little bit of red wine to de-glazethe skillet. Cook's Tip:  Brown well on bottoms before turning or meatballs will break apart. DO NOT OVERCOOK.
6. DELICIOUS VARIATION TO THIS RECIPE:  Add one (1) chopped anchovie to the above-described ground beef mixture.   Reduce your salt to a 1/4 teaspoon.,

2. Gently stir the mascarpone cheese in the container with a fork before adding to the yolks. Beat until combined. In a separate bowl whip cream to stiff peaks (not as soft as we would usually use them). Slowly fold into the yolk mixture and set aside.
3. Depending on what you use layer the glass bowl with half of the lady fingers (or half of the angelfood cake which is very absorbent mmmm!) Brush with coffee liqueur (or espresso or bailey's). Spoon half of the cream filling over the lady fingers/cake. Repeat ladyfingers coffee liqueur and top off with the rest of the fillings. Garnish with cocoa powder and chocolate shavings. Refrigerate several hours or overnight.
4. P.S. To make the chocolate curls use a vegetable peeler and run it down the edge of the chocolate bar. I especially enjoy using Cadbury's Triple Chocolate so the shaving comes out in 3 colours!,

instructions, 1. Begin by removing the outer mottled gray membranes and any dark red portions from the monkfish fillets. On a slight angle slice the fish into 1/2-inch thick medallions. Using two pieces of wax paper place a few medallions between the paper and lightly pound them with the flat side of a meat mallet or small heavy saucepan to slightly flatten them.
2. In a  4-5 quart saucepan add the potatoes and enough cold water to cover them by 3 inches season with salt and bring to a boil.
3. Reduce heat to a gentle boil and cook 10 minutes.
4. Trim the root ends and dark green leaves from the leeks. From the greens of one leek trim any yellow wilted or bruised parts and reserve them. The other two leek greens can be set aside for another use like stock. Slice the leek whites and reserved greens in half lengthwise. Rinse layers well under cold water to remove any grit from between the layers. Using one set of leek whites and greens cut again in half lengthwise. The remaining leek whites cut crosswise into 1 inch pieces. Add all the leeks to the potatoes after they have cooked at a gentle boil for 10 minutes. Cook leeks and potatoes for an additional 10 minutes or until they are tender.
5. Reserve 2 cups of the potato/leek cooking liquid. Drain the remaining liquid from the vegetables. Transfer to a blender the leek greens long pieces of leek whites and two  slices of the potato. Add approximately 1/2 cup of the reserved cooking liquid and blend until smooth. While the blender is still running add 1/2 cup of the olive oil in a thin steady stream. Blend until creamy and the sauce is thick enough to lightly coat a spoon. If necessary add more cooking liquid to get the sauce to that stage. Strain the sauce into a small saucepan keep warm over low heat.
6. In a large skillet over a medium-high flame heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the remaining leeks and potatoes that have been drained and the thyme sprigs to the skillet.
7. Season with salt and pepper and cook until golden brown turning often for approximately 12 minutes. Remove from heat and cover skillet to keep the mixture warm.
8. Sprinkle the monkfish slices with salt and lightly coat them with flour tap off excess. In a large non-stick skillet over medium flame heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil. Add as many monkfish slices as possible to fit in a single layer. Cook fish only turning once until golden brown on both sides approximately 5-7 minutes. Remove to a plate and keep warm.
9. Divide the potatoes and leeks among 6 warm dinner plates. Place the monkfish slices on top of the vegetable mixture and spoon the sauce over the fish. Garnish with a sprinkle of parsley and/or chives. Serve immediately.,

2. Rub the drumsticks with some oil aromat sage and rosemary. Then place in a baking tin in the oven on gas mark 5. Check frequently and turn over to allow even cooking.
3. Meanwhile cook the onions and peppers in a saucepan with plenty of oil at the bottom. Cook until golden then add the garlic.Cook for a minute more then add the chopped tomatoes. Add some aromat paprika sage and rosemary to the tomato sauce and cook for 20 minutes stirring frequently.
4. Add the tomato sauce on top of the chicken drumsticks and return to the oven for an hour on gas mark 3-4.

6. To make the pollenta- you simply boil it according to pack instructions. But when it is ready transfer it to an oven proof dish and add some of the tomato sauce juice on top before cooking for around 10 minutes in the oven on gas mark 6.,

instructions, 1. Cut off the stems of the eggplants and discard. Slice the eggplant lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
2. Salt and layer the eggplant slices in a colander set over a bowl.
3. Place a large bowl of water on top of the slices to act as a weight. Let the eggplant "sweat" for at least 1 hour to remove the excess water.
4. Butter a 9 x 3 1/2-inch-deep round mold or cake pan and coat the inside evenly with the 1/2 cup bread crumbs.
5. Shake out the excess crumbs and refrigerate the mold until ready to fill.
6. To make the sauce:
7. In a large saucepan heat the olive oil and cook stirring the onions carrot and celery until they soften.
8. Add the garlic and cook stirring until the garlic softens.
9. Stir in the tomatoes red wine and bay leaf.
10. Cover the pan and simmer the sauce for 30 minutes.
11. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. Remove the bay leaf before using.
12. Cook the bucatini according to the directions.
13. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Set aside.
14. In a medium-size bowl combine the veal egg white wine the 2 tablespoons grated Pecorino bread crumbs and salt. Mix gently to just combine the ingredients. Form marble-sized meatballs with your hands.
15. Note: Instead of frying the meatballs bake Bake the meatball on a lightly greased cookie sheet at 350ºF until nicely browned about 20 minutes.
16. Transfer the meatballs to the bowl with the bucatini. Add the mozzarella parsley and 2 cups of the tomato sauce. Stir to combine the ingredients well and set aside.
17. Rinse and dry the eggplant slices.
18. Heat the peanut oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Fry the eggplant slices a few at a time until they soften about 2 minutes on each side.
19. Drain the slices on brown paper.
20. Use additional oil if the pan seems dry.
21. Preheat the oven to 325ºF.
22. Line the prepared mold with the eggplant slices draping them lengthwise over the bottom and overlapping them up the sides of the mold. There should be about a 3-inch overhang over the top edges of the mold. Make sure there are no open spots and that the mold is completely lined with the slices.
23. Spoon the bucatini mixture evenly in the mold packing it down with a wooden spoon all the way around.
24. Fold the overhanging slices of eggplant in over the top of the mold; the mixture should be completely encased by the eggplant.
25. Spread 1/2 cup of the remaining tomato sauce over the top of the mold and sprinkle with the 1/4 cup Pecorino.
26. Bake the timballo uncovered for 45 minutes. It is done when the timballo shrinks a bit along the sides and a knife will easily move along the sides.
27. Remove the mold from the oven and loosely cover the top with a sheet of aluminum foil. Let the mold stand for 20 minutes.
28. Heat the remaining tomato sauce. Remove the foil from the timballo and run a butter knife around the inside edges to loosen it. Place a serving dish larger than the mold over the top and carefully invert it onto the dish.
29. Cut the timballo into wedges and serve with additional sauce on the side.
30. Tip: Use fresh mozzarella cheese but if it is not available substitute pasteurized.,

instructions, 1. Cook noodles until tender but not well done. Drain and rinse to help prevent from sticking together. Meanwhile cook ground italian sausage in a large deep skillet or pan until no longer pink. Rope or link style italian sausage is okay just cut the casing off before cooking. Add the ground beef to the skillet. Cook untill all meat is starting to brown. Also meanwhile combine the cheeses and parsley in a large bowl. Mix well.
2. Use a large baking pan (I use a 13" wide x 18" long x 3" deep) Spread a layer of sauce across the bottom of the pan slightly more than just enough to cover the entire surface. Place a layer of noodles on top of the sauce overlapping the edges just a bit. Spoon some of the cheese mixture (about 1/4) on top of the noodles (in even globs). Sprinkle with 1/4 of the meat mixture. Spoon some sauce on top. Then another layer noodle --  cheese --  meat --  sauce --  noodle --  cheese --  meat --  sauce --  noodle --  cheese --  meat --  sauce. Then top with another layer of noodle and sauce spread evenly on top. Remember to slightly overlap the noodles in each layer. (You may have some left over noodles and sauce which is great to spread a little sauce on a noodle and roll up as a snack for an impatient child.)
3. Cover tightly with foil. Cook in a preheated oven at 325 degrees on center rack for 1 hour. Let cool at least 20 minutes before cutting to help prevent the cheese from running. Serve with a side salad and garlic bread.,

instructions, 1. THE NIGHT BEFORE (or early in the day): Cook lasagna noodles in 6 quarts boiling water for 5-7 minutes or until tender; drain wipe noodles dry with a clean/dry cloth lay flat on waxed paper.
2. While noodles are cooking melt butter and olive oil in a large skillet.
3. Saute onion garlic and mushrooms until they're tender; add remove from heat; set aside.
4. Place cooked chicken in food processor and pulse until chicken resembles a tuna salad mixture.
5. Combine chicken with the onions garlic mushrooms and the fat in which they were sauteed; add egg cream and seasonings. Add spinach (cooked) and mix well.
6. Cut each lasagna noodle into 2 or 3 pieces-each piece should be 3 to 4 inches long; place a tablespoonful of the chicken filling on each piece and roll into a tubular shape. If you don't want to make canneloni just layer the ingredients like you would for lasagna.
7. Arrange rolls next to each other one layer deep in a buttered baking dish; set aside while you prepare the cheese sauce.
8. CHEESE SAUCE: Melt butter then add the flour and cook for a few minutes to get rid of the floury taste.
9. Gradually add the chicken broth whisking constantly to prevent lumps; add cream salt and pepper. Cook stirring constantly until thickened and smooth; remove from heat. Stir in 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese and mix well.
10. I like to use both red and white sauce on this one. I spoon over a strip of the white sauce next to it I spoon on some red; keep doing that across the dish until the sauce covers the noodles. The red/white pattern makes it look pretty and gives the dish a little more flavor. It also cuts back on some of the fat.
11. Spoon sauce over cannelloni in baking dish; sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese and Mozzarella cheese if used; refrigerate until you're ready to bake it.
12. BEFORE SERVING: Preheat broiler; place cannelloni 4-5 inches from heat and broil for 10 minutes or until sauce bubbles and top browns. If you'll be making lasagna bake in a 350-degree oven for 25-30 minutes or until it's bubbly and the top is browned a bit.,

instructions, 1. If the pork is on the bone cut it into pieces. If it is boneless cut into large chunks (about 1 1/2 inches) that are about the same size. Season the pork all over with salt and pepper to taste. Toss with parsley.
2. Chop together the onions garlic and pancetta until they are finely minced but not pasty. May use a meat grinder or food processor.
3. Heat the olive oil in a large casserole preferably earthenware or cast iron over low heat. Add the pancetta mixture and stir to combine. Scatter the pork pieces over the pancetta mixture cover and cook very slowly. After about 30 minutes give the mixture a stir replace the lid and continue cooking until the onions have begun to color about 30 minutes more. The meat won't brown.
4. Add the red wine and increase the heat so the liquid just comes to a simmer. Cook uncovered stirring occasionally until most of the liquid has evaporated about 2 hours.
5. Raise the heat to medium add the tomato paste half at a time and cook stirring constantly until the paste mixes in and becomes dark brown. Season to taste with salt.
6. Add the chopped tomatoes and one-fourth cup water reduce heat to low cover and cook another hour stirring occasionally and adding water from time to time to keep the sauce somewhat liquid. Keep an eye on it; if the sauce gets too thick it will tend to scorch toward the center of the pan. Just add a little more water and keep cooking. You may add as much as three-fourths cup in all depending on the heat. Iuse a heat diffuser plate beneath my pot or bake in the oven in Dutch oven to avoid the scorching problem.
7. When the pork is tender enough that it starts to shred when stirred after about 30 minutes add the sausage and continue cooking the sauce for another 30 minutes or more. Season with salt and pepper to taste. The sauce should be very dark red shiny and thick almost sticky. If the meat has slipped from the bones remove the bones before serving.,

cuisine, European >> Italian >> Italian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Lay a long piece of plastic wrap over your cutting board and tuck it underneath the sides of the board. (Covering the chicken with the plastic will also keep the mess down when you pound with the meat mallet.) The chicken breasts should be placed on the covered cutting board skin side down with enough space between them so they can lay flat after you "butterfly" them.
2. To make the butterfly cut carefully slice open (without slicing the chicken all the way through) and spread the flesh of the chicken out so you will be able to pound it out into a single thin piece on which you will place stuffing and then roll up. Season the breasts with salt and pepper. Then put another length of plastic wrap over the seasoned chicken breasts and flatten with meat mallet to integrate the seasoning into the chicken. Pound chicken thin.
3. Lay 1 slice of prosciutto ham on each breast. Add 3 leaves of spinach and 4 pieces of sun-dried tomatoes on each breast. Fold in each end and roll tightly.
4. Place on sheet tray and freeze until firm. (It does not have to be frozen completely hard but this makes it easier to handle when breading.).
5. Preheat a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
6. While the chicken roulade is hardening in the freezer prepare the tomato demi-glace. In a saucepan saute garlic and then deglaze the pan with the wine. Add stock and tomato puree. Boil over medium heat until reduced by half. Add the demi-glace (brown sauce) and let simmer until thickened ("medium thickness").
7. When the chicken is firm set up a breading station. Whisk together 3 eggs and 1 cup of the half-and-half for the egg wash. (Begin with this amount and whisk more together if needed.) Then set up a bowl each of: flour then egg wash and then Italian bread crumbs.
8. Evenly coat rolled frozen chicken with flour (not too much or bread crumbs won't stick). Dip floured rolled chicken into egg wash then into bread crumbs.
9. In a deep-fat fryer lightly fry until golden brown. Finish in the oven for 15 minutes until completely cooked through. Remove from oven and let rest.
10. Re-heat the tomato demi-glace and to finish remove from heat and immediately whisk in fresh thyme and 1 tablespoon butter.
11. Slice each chicken roll to expose the stuffed interior.,

instructions, 1. In the bread machine's basin proof the yeast by pouring in the warm water  and dissolving the pinch of sugar in it then sprinkling the yeast on top-- if you don't have a 1/8 teaspoon size or a sliding measuring spoon just leave few millimeters of leeway in a 1/2 tsp size spoon.
2. Let the yeast proof for 10 minutes with the bread machine's lid open.
3. Add the flours and salt and blend well by hand or slowly with a dough hook until the flour has completely absorbed the water.
4. If you want add rosemary or other herbs add them now too and blend.
5. Pour on the olive oil around the bin but don't blend it in by hand.
6. Close the bread machine and set it for a 2-lb loaf (1.5 should work if that's all your machine goes up to) at the DOUGH CYCLE. Kick back and let it do its work!
7. When the dough cycle ends leave it in the machine covered for 20-30 minutes to rise. After the rise is complete preheat the oven to 425°F.
8. Grease an 11 x 7 pan with the 1/2 tsp olive oil-- NOT a loaf pan. This bread is best coming out relatively flat! The olive oil is a must for this cooking spray won't make it come out the same! Brush the olive oil all over the inside of the pan then sprinkle the cornmeal all over the bottom of the pan.
9. Extract the dough from the bread machine it should have a wonderful thick and elasticy consistency. Lay it into the prepped loaf pan and smooth out the top when done.
10. Bake at 425F for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown on top.
11. For that rustic look and crackly feel brush a little olive oil onto the top and dust with some flour prior to baking.
12. For Roman style ciabatta season with marjoram and you can also make it ciabatta al latte by softening the dough with milk.,

instructions, 1. Make the broth:.
2. Remove the meat from the crab legs.  Usually I'll break the legs at the joints and use a pair of kitchen shears to cut them open.
3. Put the shells in the water with the carrots chopped onions and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer and simmer for 5-10 minutes.  (If you have some extra crab shrimp or lobster shells in the freezer you can throw some in.) If you don't have the carrots you can leave them out - sometimes I add a wee bit of celery or a few whole peppercorns.
4. Strain the broth and put it back in the pan on low heat.
5. Make the risotto:.
6. Heat up a small skillet on medium heat add the oil and onions. Soften then onions. Add the rice and stir till it’s a little toasted/opaque. Add the tomato paste and allow it to cook a little. Before it burns add the wine deglaze let it simmer a little.  Add enough broth to cover rice.  Simmer stirring or shaking the pan as necessary (probably every 30-60 seconds try to keep the rice from sticking to the bottom) topping off broth as necessary.  After 15 minutes or so it should be close to done taste the rice to check the texture. (I cook it al dente - a little bit of texture left if you prefer mushier go for it.)  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
7. Add the crab meat. Cook for another minute to warm the meat. Remove from heat add the butter and parsley and stir to melt. Go easy on the parsley but don't leave it out. If the rice is a little drier than you like add a little more broth but check the seasoning afterwards.
8. If you run low on broth you can top it off with water. If you have a lot left over use less water next time.,

instructions, 1. With the smooth side of a meat mallet pound chicken breasts between sheets of plastic wrap to a thickness of slightly over 1/4-inch.
2. Cut each pounded breast in half in order to make regular size cutlets.  If using large size chicken breasts you may need to cut them into thirds.
3. Place 4 fresh sage leaves on the under-side of each pounded chicken breast. Cover leaves with prosciutto (you may need to use more than one slice of prosciutto so as to fully cover breast).  Pound very lightly with "toothy" side of meat mallet to help adhere sage leaves and prosciutto to breast (be careful not to tear through).
4. Dredge chicken in flour and shake off excess being careful not to dislodge prosciutto and sage.  Place chicken on a large platter or cookie sheet.  Place in refrigerator for 10 - 30 minutes (this will help flour to glue itself to chicken resulting in a better fry).
5. Meanwhile chop remaining sage leaves for a total of 1 T set aside.
6. Place a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Once skillet is hot add enough olive oil and heat through.
7. Sauté chicken about 2 - 3 minutes per side or until golden and just cooked through. Remove chicken to a clean platter.
8. Immediately top mozzarella on each cutlet while chicken is still hot.  Sprinkle a few drops of freshly squeezed lemon juice on each cutlet.  Cover immediately in order to help cheese melting process. (This works best if using a platter with a full coverage lid such as corning ware).
9. Remove any excess olive oil in order to end up with at least 2 – 3 tablespoons oil remaining in skillet.  Add marsala or port and white wine to hot skillet and let boil scraping up browned bits for 1 minute. Add stock to skillet and boil until reduced to 3/4 cup. Add chopped sage. Simmer 1 minute. Adjust seasoning with black pepper and salt if necessary (salt may not be needed depending on saltiness of chicken stock and prosciutto).  Pour sauce carefully to the side edge of platter being careful not to pour quickly over chicken so as to keep mozzarella in tact.
10. NOTE:  Most of the time I double and even triple the sauce.
11. Fresh sage in this dish is a Must the dry will not be the same and will result in something different.,

instructions, 1. Mix yeast with 1/2 C of lukewarm water and let it proof.  This usually takes 5-15 minutes.
2. Place all ingredients including the remaining lukewarm water (1 1/4 C plus 2 T)  according to the ABM machine instruction and set it for dough only.  My ABM takes 2 hours for dough only setting.
3. After the 2 hours are up take out the dough and place it in a well olive oiled large bowl.  Turn the dough to coat it with the oil and cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put the bowl in the refrigerator overnight.  The overnight method makes wonderful tasting pizzas.
4. Next day remove the bowl of dough from the refrigerator 2 hours before you plan to make the pizzas. The dough will have expanded and gluten very relaxed.
5. Using wet hands gently transfer the dough to a floured counter trying not to degas the dough as little as possible.
6. Using a pastry blade or knife dipped in water divide the dough into 6 equal pieces.  Gently round each piece into a ball and brush or rub each ball with the olive oil.
7. Brush the sheet pan with olive oil and place each dough ball on the pan and loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap.  (If you do not plan to use all the pieces place the extra ones in individual freezer bags and freeze).
8. Allow the dough balls to sit at room temperature 2 hours before making the pizzas.
9. Preheat the oven to 500°F.
10. Roll out the each dough into 9 to 12 inch diameter pizzas using a rolling pin and your hands.  This dough is very soft elastic and hard to handle compared to other pizza doughs and will require some effort to get to 9 inches diameter. I use combination patting down stretching and use of rolling pin to get it to 9 inch diameter.  Once you get very good handling this dough you may get it to 12 inch diameter but 9 inch is perfectly fine.
11. Lightly oil the pizza baking pan and place the pizza.  Spread 1/4 C to 1/2 C sauce over the surface of dough leaving a 1/4 to 1/2 inch border uncovered.   Arrange mozzarella over the top and sprinkle with grated Parmesan or Romano cheese.
12. Bake for about 9-10 minutes in the middle rack.  When done the crust should be puffy and slightly charred on the edge and thinner in the center and cheese fully melted and just beginning to brown in spots.  The underside of the crust should be brown and crisp not white and soft.  Keep an eye on it until you know how long your oven will take because each oven is different.
13. Remove the pizza from the oven and lay 4 - 6 basil leaves.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make the next pizza.,

6. Add browned ground beef and bring to a gentle simmer. If the amount of juice seems inadequate (plum or grape tomatoes are less juicy than the canning and slicing types) add about 1/2 cup V8 tomato juice or beef stock. But don’t make it too wet or the tortellini will get mushy and unappealing.
7. Remove from heat. Toss with hot tortellini.
8. Stir in the Parmesan and half the Mozzarella. Top with remaining Mozzarella.
9. Bake at 350F for 20-30 minutes or until the cheese bubbles and starts to brown.

instructions, 1. * *Water for dough: Use 1 cup water in summer (or in a humid environment) 1 1/4 cups water in winter (or in a dry climate) and somewhere in between the rest of the year or if your house is climate controlled.
2. Directions.
3. Make the starter by mixing the yeast with the water (no need to do this if you're using instant yeast) then mixing in the flour to make a soft dough. Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 14 hours; overnight works well. The starter should have risen and become bubbly. If it hasn't your yeast may not be working. Dissolve 1/4 teaspoon of yeast in 1 tablespoon lukewarm water with a pinch of sugar and wait 15 minutes. If nothing happens replace your yeast and begin the starter process again.
4. If you're using active dry yeast mix it with the water then combine with the starter flour and salt. If you're using instant yeast there's no need to combine it with the water first. Mix and knead everything together—by hand mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle—till you've made a soft somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive but the surface may still be a bit rough. Knead for about 5 minutes on speed 2 of a stand mixer.
5. Place the dough in a lightly greased medium-size bowl cover the bowl and let the dough rise for 3 hours gently deflating it and turning it over after 1 hour and then again after 2 hours.
6. Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Divide it into three equal pieces.
7. Shape each piece into a rough slightly flattened oval cover with greased plastic wrap and let them rest for 15 minutes.
8. Working with one piece of dough at a time fold the dough in half lengthwise and seal the edges with the heel of your hand. Flatten it slightly and fold and seal again.
9. With the seam-side down cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 15" log. Place the logs seam-side down onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined sheet pan or pans.*.
10. Cover them with a cover or lightly greased plastic wrap and allow the loaves to rise till they've become very puffy about 1 1/2 hours.
11. Towards the end of the rising time preheat your oven to 450°F; if you're using a baking stone place it on the lowest rack.
12. Using a very sharp knife held at about a 45° angle make three 8" vertical slashes in each baguette. Spritz the baguettes heavily with warm water; this will help them develop a crackly-crisp crust.
13. Bake the baguettes until they're a very deep golden brown 25 to 30 minutes. Remove them from the oven and cool on a rack. Or for the very crispiest baguettes turn off the oven crack it open about 2" and allow the baguettes to cool in the oven.,

instructions, 1. Start off by mincing the onions.  They must be as small as possible.  Set aside in a bowl.
2. Mince the garlic then form a garlic paste.
3. **Note** To form a garlic paste mince garlic add some sea or kosher salt and olive oil and use the back end of a chef's knife to work the garlic into a paste.
4. For the whole tomatoes remove each tomato by hand and place into a food processor.  Leave puree in the can.  Pulse the tomatoes until crushed leaving some texture.  Strain through a fine mesh sieve - you'll remove about 1 cup of water.  Discard the water and add crushed tomatoes back to puree in the can.  Set aside.
5. In a sauce pot heat olive oil over medium heat.  Cook onions and garlic for about 3-5 minutes or until garlic begins to smell like it's roasted.  It should just start to be taking on color.  This step is very important and one where you have to go by the smell rather than the color of the garlic.  Once you begin to smell that roasted garlic smell the onion/garlic is ready.  Stir constantly.
6. Add tomato paste and stir cooking the paste for 1 minute.
7. Add wine and stir.  The wine should instantly thicken due to the tomato paste.  Cook for 2-3 minutes.  It is not necessary to reduce.
8. Reduce heat to medium/low.
9. Add red pepper flakes oregano salt pepper and sugar.  Stir and cook briefly for 1 minute.
10. Add the tomatoes you pureed and the crushed tomatoes.  Stir cover pot and allow to cook for 20 minutes.
11. After 20 minutes taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.  Sauce can be cooked longer but I prefer a more vibrant tomato taste.  The longer you cook it the more rich the tomato flavor will become.  This is totally personal preference.  After 20 minutes my pasta water is boiling away and I start cooking the pasta.
12. When your pasta is finished cooking reserve 1 cup of the pasta water.  I always add at least 1/4 cup of the pasta water to the sauce.  It helps the sauce stick to the pasta.
13. Tips on pasta - never never never never add oil to the water and never rinse your cooked pasta.  The pasta can be drained and added directly to the sauce or add your drained pasta to a bowl and toss with 1 cup of your tomato sauce.
14. Add basil to sauce right before serving as basil looses it's flavor immediately from the heat.   Also do a final seasoning adjustment if necessary right before serving.  I like to add a drizzle of good quality extra virgin olive oil and an extra pinch of red pepper flakes.
15. I cannot stress enough the steps are important and this generally takes me 15 minutes max to put together --  but all ingredients are personal choice.  Add more or less of whatever you like.,

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat your oven to 450 degrees.
2. 2. Spray down a large cookie sheet with cooking spray and arragne the eggplant in a single layer on the cookie sheet (In order to get all the eggplant done this may have to be done in batches). Brush the eggplant down with some Olive Oil and season with salt and pepper.  Put in your preheated oven for 15 minutes  Once it's done take the eggplant out and let it cool and lower your oven down to 350 degrees.
3. 3. In the meantime get a sautee pan nice and hot and put some olive oil in it (about a tablespoon) and sautee your onions for about 3 mins just until they are translusent.  Once the onions are translusent add the garlic and sautee for another 1 or 2 minutes (be sure not to burn the garlic).
4. 4. Once the onions and garlic are sauteed add the turkey to the pan and brown.
5. 5.After you brown the turkey mix in the marina and 1/2 of the fresh basil 1/2 of the fresh parsley. Bring to a boil and then reduce to simmer.
6. 6. In a separate mixing bowl mix the cottage cheese 1/2 of the grated cheese salt pepper garlic powder onion powder red pepper flakes remainder of the basil and parsley and mix all of it together until it's well combined.
7. 7. In a lasagna pan put a little bit of the sauce and meat mixture and spread it out to cover the bottom of the dish.  Then layer a single layer of the eggplant rounds (I overlap mine a little so that there is no open space between them).  Then put 1/3 of the cottage cheese mixutre then 1/3 of the meat sauce mixture.  Then layer the sliced mozzarella (approx. 6 slices) top with 1/3 of the of the remaining grated cheese.  Then repeat the layers eggplant cottage cheese meat sauce cheese.  And then again.  The last layer should be eggplant then meat sauce mozzarella and grated cheese.
8. 8. Once it's all assembled cover with foil (lightly so that the foil doesn't touch the cheese - you could also put toothpicks in to hold the foil up) and put in the 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  After 30 mins take off the foil and put it back in the oven for another 10 mins until the cheese is bubbly and hot.
9. 9. When it's all done take it out of the oven and let it sit for about 15 mins to set.  Enjoy!,

2. Grind fennel with a mortar and pestle.  Add the cinnamon and salt and continue grinding.  Or grind in spice grinder for a rough grind.
3. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
4. Using a vegetable peeler remove the squash's hard shell.  Trim about 1/2-inch off the top and bottom ends so you can set each section of the squash flat and cut on a cutting board.  Cut the squash in half lengthwise.  Scoop the seeds out with a spoon and coarsely chop the squash into 1/2-inch chunks.  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.  In a bowl toss the squash with the oil sage and 1 tablespoon of the fennel and cinnamon spice blend and 1 teaspoon salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Spread the squash in a single layer on the baking sheet.  Roast the squash in the oven until very soft and beginning to brown 40 to 50 minutes stirring once or twice.  Remove the squash from the oven and puree in a food processor with fresh nutmeg.
5. In a large bowl mix the squash puree ricotta Parmesan cheese eggs 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Cover and refrigerate the mixture until ready to use.

7. PREPARE THE SAUCE:
8. In a large saucepan bring the milk to a slow simmer over medium heat.  In a large pot melt the butter over medium-low heat.  Add the sage and garlic to the butter cook for 30 seconds then add the flour and stir.  Add about 3 cups of the milk and whisk vigorously to prevent lumps.  Bring to a boil while whisking continuously.  Add the remaining milk and whisk again.  Add the salt pepper and nutmeg.  Adjust the heat to low to maintain a slow simmer and cook until the sauce coats the back of a spoon about 5 minutes whisking frequently.  Remove the saucepan from the heat.  Makes about 8 cups.
9. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
10. Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.  Spoon a ladel of bechamel into the dish and spread to coat the bottom.  Place a single layer of lasagna sheets on top of the bechamel.  Spread some of the squash mixture evenly over the lasagna sheets and sprinkle about 2 tablespoons mozzarella cheese and 1 tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese on top.  Repeat this step until all ingredients are used starting with 2 to 3 ladels of bechamel for each layer.  Keep building the layers until the pan is full to about 1/4-inch from the top.  Finish with bechamel and cheese directly over the noodles.  Bake in the middle of the oven for about 1 hour.  Remove the cover and continue cooking for another 15 minutes until golden brown and bubbling.  Allow lasagna to rest about 15 minutes before slicing.  Serve warm.,

instructions, 1. MEAT MIXTURE: To a large skillet add oil sausage garlic Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper flakes. cook over medium high heat stirring occasionally until just about cooked through. Add bell pepper and continue to cook 2-3 minutes longer until sausage is fully cooked.
2. Place the 2 jars of spaghetti sauce in a large food processor.  When meat is done strain in a collander then put in the food processor with the sauce. Blend for 30 seconds or so. Place meat mixture in a bowl and set aside.
3. CHEESE MIXTURE: Mix all cheeses together and set aside.
4. NOODLES: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 2 tsp salt and 1 tbsp vegetable oil. Place lasagna noodles one at a time carefully into the boiling water. Stir gently with a wooden spoon until all noodles have softened to the bending stage. Reduce heat and simmer about 15 minutes until they are cooked through.
5. Place a large collander in the sink and gently drain the noodles. Run cold tap water over noodles or dunk collander into a larger bowl that has cold water in it. (you want to cool all the noodles and stop the cooking process and keep them from sticking).
6. ASSEMBLY: Lay out a few layers of paper towels onto your workspace that are long enough to place a few sheets of noodles on (about two rows of towels). Place 2-3 noodles onto the paper towels then lay another couple of sheets of paper towels and blot the noodles dry.
7. To a 9x13x3" (or larger) pan spread 1/2 of the remaining jar of sauce in the bottom and set aside. Place noodles into the pan in a single layer overlapping the curly ends if necessary and cutting any noodles to fit if necessary.
8. Spread 1/3 of the sausage mixture evenly onto the noodles. you can use your fingers or the back of a spoon. Scantly sprinkle with 1/3 each of the pepperoni mushrooms and onion then cheese mixture.
9. Repeat layers of noodles sausage toppings and cheeses then end with a last layer of noodles. Spread remaining 1/2 jar of sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese. (at this point you can cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze until needed. If freezing thaw at room temperature a few hours before baking).
10. Preheat oven to 350°F Bake lasagna fresh for 45 minutes (60-75 minutes if refrigerated and 75-90 minutes if thawed) or until bubbly and cooked through. Let sit for at least 10 minutes before serving. Lasagnes are so good the next day!
11. TO FREEZE FOR OAMC: A simple way to freeze this for multiple dinners (prior to cooking) is to chill it for at least 24 hrs in the refrigerator. Then place plastic wrap over the top of the lasagna and then place a large cutting board over that and carefully flip over onto the counter and remove the pan.
12. Using a sharp butcher knife slice it down the center longways. then slice the from the short sides into however many servings you like (1x for 4 dinners 2x for 6 dinners etc.). Then simply wrap each dinner-serving size well with plastic wrap and then foil for an airtight seal.
13. When your wanting to serve it for dinner simply take it from the freezer the day before thaw in the fridge overnight then unwrap it re-wrap it in foil only with a little more sauce and bake.,

instructions, 1. In a bowl combine the dry yeast and sugar with the lukewarm water and olive oil. Whisk briefly to dissolve everything and let it proof for 5-10 minutes. You will know when to stop when the liquid looks all frothy as if it were covered in sea foam.
2. In a separate bowl -preferably the working bowl of your stand mixer- (this is a stand-mixer recipe; if you want to do it by hand see below) combine the two types of flour the salt and the garlic powder.  Add the dried basil by rubbing the leaves together between your fingertips to reduce it to a powder.
3. Mix the dry ingredients together until everything is equally distributed.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir to combine.
5. If in a stand-mixer use your dough-hook.  Beat the combined dough at the highest speed you can for 5 - 6 minutes.  ALTERNATIVE:  If doing this by hand dust your counter top with a little bit of flour to prevent sticking and start folding the mixed dough over with your hands and pressing it flat.  Turn 45-degrees fold press and repeat.  Knead like this with your full-strength for about 7 minutes.
6. Lightly spread some olive oil around the sides of a clean large bowl as well as on the surface of the rounded dough ball you have made. Place the dough into this bowl.
7. Cover the top of the bowl with a clean light-weight towel place it in a warm part of the room and let it rise for 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
8. When it has risen divide the dough into two balls and roll it out to an oval about the size of your pizza stone.
9. Once you have your round flat dough ready put it on a cutting board or other flat surface with a small dusting of yellow corn meal beneath it. This is an old trick that I learned while making pizzas years ago in a restaurant. The corn meal will allow the dough to slide around easily and will help when you go to slide it into your heated oven and onto the pizza stone.
10. Add your sauce and desired pizza toppings (try to keep it to 3 or less including cheese for the best results) and place on a hot stone or pan that is in an already-hot 450-degree (Fahrenheit) oven. NOTE:  A good pattern I have learned from years of making pizza is:  first layer - sauce second layer - half of your cheese third layer - your non-cheese toppings and fourth layer - the remainder of your cheese.
11. Cook for 13 - 16 minutes or until any cheese turns brown in little spots.
12. Let your pizza rest for 10 minutes before cutting.,

instructions, 1. Slice the amount of garlic cloves you wish to use thinly. Add the garlic to a saute pan that has been heated with the oil and butter in it over medium high heat (*Note: If you're not a big fan of garlic just add 1 whole clove slightly cracked to the oil and saute it for about 2-3 minutes then remove the garlic from the pan).
2. Add the cucuzzi to the pan and mix with the sauteed garlic. Continue to saute the cucuzzi and garlic until the cucuzzi gets colored always watching that you are not burning the garlic you left in the pan. Cucuzzi can take a lot of color in the pan before it burns and it gets sweeter as it gets the deeper color.
3. Prepare the spaghetti to the "al dente" point and then thoroughly drain it.
4. Add all the cucuzzi oil butter and garlic to the spaghetti and toss to thoroughly mix.
5. Add the grated cheese to the spaghetti and toss it once more. If the spaghetti mixture seems dry add a little more butter and/or olive oil to moisten. Hint: You can add more cheese if you like I do.
6. Season with salt and pepper to taste -- Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. For the biga:
2. Combine the flour yeast and water in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the dough hook.  Knead on the slowest speed (stir for a KitchenAid) until it forms a shaggy dough about 2-3 minutes.
3. Transfer the biga to a medium bowl cover tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature until it begins to bubble and rise about 3 hours.
4. Refrigerate biga at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.
5. For the dough:
6. Remove the biga from the refrigerator and let stand at room temp while making the dough.
7. To make the dough combine flour yeast and water in bowl of the standing mixer fitted with dough hook. Knead the dough on lowest speed until rough dough is formed about 3 minutes.
8. Turn the mixer off and without removing the dough hook or bowl from the mixer cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest for 20 minutes. (This allows protein in the dough to relax making for a stronger dough that can rise higher with a better crust.).
9. Remove the plastic wrap over the dough and add the biga and salt to bowl. Continue to knead on the lowest speed until ingredients are incorporated (dough should clear the sides of the bowl but should stick to the very bottom) about 4 minutes.
10. Increase the mixer speed to low (speed 2 on a KitchenAid) and continue until the dough forms a more cohesive ball about 1 minute.
11. Transfer the dough to a large bowl (at least 3 times the size of the dough) and cover it tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a cool draft-free spot away from direct sunlight until slightly risen and puffy about 1 hour.
12. Remove the plastic wrap and turn the dough by doing the following: lift the left third of the dough and fold inwards towards the center then repeat with the right third of the dough folding inwards toward the center.  Then fold the dough in half from bottom to top (perpendicular to the first two folds).
13. Replace the plastic wrap and let the dough rise 1 hour.
14. Turn dough again replace plastic wrap and let dough rise 1 hour longer.
15. Dust the work surface liberally with flour. Hold the bowl with the dough at an angle over the floured surface. Gently scrape the dough out of the bowl and onto the work surface (the side of the dough that was against bowl should now be facing up). If you want two smaller loaves split the dough into two equal halves. Use a knife or bench scraper.
16. Dust the dough and your hands liberally with flour and using minimal pressure push dough into a rough 8- to 10-inch square. If you are making two loaves shape each piece into a smaller rectangle.
17. Shape the dough by folding the upper left corner towards the center of the square dough then the right corner towards the center.  Next roll the dough into a log from top to bottom and place it seam-side down onto a large sheet of parchment paper. Dust loaf liberally with flour and cover loosely with plastic wrap; let loaf rise until doubled in size about 1 hour.
18. Meanwhile adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and place a baking stone on the rack. (I use a cast iron griddle flat side up.)  Pre-heat the oven to 500 degrees.  It's really important to preheat the pan in the oven to ensure even heat and optimal crust results.
19. Using a single-edged razor blade or sharp chef’s knife cut a slit 1/2 inch deep lengthwise along top of loaf starting and stopping about 1 1/2 inches from the ends. Lightly spray the loaf with water. Slide parchment sheet with loaf onto baker’s stone or cast iron griddle in the oven. If you are not using a baking stone or tile simply place the loaf on a baking sheet in the oven.
20. Bake for 10 minutes then reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees and quickly spin loaf around half way using the edges of the parchment paper.
21. Continue to bake until deep golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.  For one large loaf this will be about 35 minutes longer. For two smaller loaves this will be closer to 30 minutes.
22. When the bread is done transfer it to a wire rack and discard the parchment paper. If you'd like a butter crust immediately wipe the end of a stick of butter over the crust until coated.  Now the hardest part – cool the loaf to room temperature about 2 hours.,

instructions, 1. In a large bowl (or your KitchenAid) dissolve yeast with 3/4 cup of the water and sugar. Mix in remaining water flour and salt. Mix until dough starts to form. If too sticky add a bit more flour. Knead for 2-3 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Put dough into an oiled bowl turn to coat cover with a clean towel and let rise in a warm place free from draft until doubled in size (about 2 hours).
2. Preheat oven to 400°F If you have a baking stone dust lightly with cornmeal and put into preheated oven. If not use a cookie sheet. Place a shallow baking pan filled with boiling hot water on bottom of your oven for extra crusty rolls.
3. ROLLS: Remove dough to a floured surface. Punch down dough and shape into 4 rolls. Place rolls on a peel (large wooden spatula) also lightly dusted with cornmeal or on a cookie sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover and let rise again for 20 minutes. Slit each roll once and brush tops with egg wash and sprinkle lightly with poppy seeds. If on a peel slide loaves onto stone or tile; otherwise put cookie sheet in oven. Bake for about 25 minutes or until golden and baked through.

instructions, 1. For the pasta – get a large pot of well salted water on high heat.
2. As you wait for the water to boil make your frascatelli.
3. Dump the semolina into a baking dish shaking to create one even layer. Have one cup of water ready and waiting at the side of the dish.
4. Dip all five of your fingertips into the water and lifting water with them spray the water over the top of the semolina flour. Do this repeatedly until most of the surface is covered in splotches of water. Wait 30 seconds for the water to absorb into the flour. Then using a slotted spoon spatula or really even your fingers gently turn the flour onto itself forming dumplings.
5. Put the dumplings into a colander or sieve and shake out the excess semolina over the baking dish. Gently transfer the finished dumplings onto a baking sheet.
6. Return to the baking dish and repeat the same process until you have used all of the semolina and/or water. You may have a little water left at the end which is fine. The bits of semolina that remain in the bottom of the baking dish can be pressed together to form dumplings.
7. In a 12′ sauté pan gently heat the olive oil minced garlic and red pepper flakes over low heat. Once the garlic is fragrant add the trimmed broccoli.
8. Season generously with salt and black pepper and whichever liquid you are using – wine or veggie stock or water – to the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil stir the broccoli and place a lid on the pan – steaming the broccoli for a few minutes.
9. Remove the lid and turn the heat off.
10. Once the water boils cook the frascatelli. Use a wooden spoon to make a vortex or whirlpool in the water – this helps to prevent the frascatelli from sticking to each other and the bottom of the pot. Cook the frascatelli for no more than 1 minute.
11. Drain the water and add the frascatelli directly to the broccoli. Stir well.
12. Taste and adjust seasoning.
13. To serve: top with freshly grated Pecorino cheese and a drizzle of olive oil.,

instructions, 1. Take your spaghetti squash and cut in half lengthwise.
2. Pierce the skin with a fork on the bottoms.
3. Bake the two evenly cut halves of your spaghetti squash in a round glass baking dish with a light coating of olive oil at 350 degrees until they start to brown and the skin is tender (approx 45 minutes).
4. Ready for the veggi saugage? I prefer "GimmeLean" brand as it is virtually fat free full of protein and has a wonderful fennel taste. Dice up some garlic onions basil and mold into small 1" meatballs.10's a good round number.
5. In a sauté pan sauté round rings of yellow onions mushrooms zucchini and your non-meat meatballs in olive oil until perfectly brown firm and filling your kitchen with an aroma even Sophia Loren couldn't resist --
6. Now to focus on the sauce. Empty the contents of your two cans of Italian style stewed tomatoes in a deep dish pan add to it everything you just sautéed and don't skimp on the basil or additional garlic. There are no correct portions here --  continue sampling your wooden spoon over and over until its just right.This sauce is meant to be light or it will overpower the squash. I usually add in a splash of red wine to the mix salt and fresh ground pepper to taste.
7. So hopefully you have timed things so the squash is just finishing up cooking. Remove your squash halves carefully. Let them cool down some. Then with a fork begin to scrape out the contents into the pan with your sauce. This is the most enjoyable part of this recipe as it always amazes me to see just how much the fibers of the squash resemble spaghetti! Leave a little squash in each half and use them as the bowls for serving.
8. Garnish with organic basil and the dish is ready to serve.,

instructions, 1. Brown your ground beef on  med heat until done. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees.  On your premade thin crust cover with an ample amount of pizza sauce.  Use half of your thinly sliced pepperoni.  The pepperoni should be thin enough to crush up into a ball.  They may come partially undone but that's ok.  Put the balled pepperoni on top of the sauce in an even spread. Now use about half of your ground beef the same way.  Next shred your fresh mozzarella.  The bag stuff just isn't the same.  Add the mozzarella cheese evenly.  Now use the rest of your ground beef on top followed by the rest of your pepperoni (either balled like before or not your choice).  The thin pepperoni may burn a bit if you do not ball it up.  Now top off with your oregano and parmesan cheese.  Bake in the preheated oven for between 10 and 15 minuets depending on how brown you want the cheese and how dark and crispy you want the crust.  *note*  store bought crust will burn if the oven is too hot or if you overcook the pizza.  It will be hard.  Taking the pizza out as soon as you can see the edges turning golden brown and the middle of the pizza is bubbly and rising.  Otherwise the cheese in the center may not be fully cooked or you will cause the crust to burn.  Getting it just right may take some practice but in the end this is a fantastic pizza in my opinion.  Also fun for the whole family.,

instructions, 1. Rinse the broccoli and cut it into bite-size florets. If you're feeling thrifty you can peel and slice the "trunk" into bite-size pieces too although using florets only makes for an attractive presentation.
2. Peel the garlic and mince it fine. Chop the anchovies fine discarding any excess oil.
3. Heat the olive oil in a small saute pan or skillet over medium-low heat and gently cook the minced garlic with a small shake of dried red-pepper flakes (just enough for an accent; you don't want a fiery dish) until the garlic turns translucent and aromatic. Stir in the chopped anchovies and continue poaching gently for a few minutes stirring until the anchovies dissolve into the oil. Set aside and keep warm.
4. Meanwhile heat a large pot full of lightly salted water and cook the broccoli and pasta together until the pasta is done; at that point the broccoli will be very soft.
5. Drain the broccoli and pasta catching a bit of the pasta water in a measuring cup. Put the broccoli and pasta in a warm serving bowl and toss with the anchovy and garlic oil and if necessary a bit of the pasta water to achieve a thick saucy texture. Serve with crusty bread and a salad as a hearty side dish or main course.,

instructions, 1. Chop the mozzarella and taleggio into small chunks and tip into a bowl with the butter garlic herbs and some salt and pepper.
2. Using a bread knife cut diagonal slices along the loaf about three quarters of the way into the bread - don't cut all the way through. If it looks like the bread won't fit in the oven cut it in half and make two smaller ones.
3. Push the garlic butter generously between each cut allowing some to ooze onto the top - it will caramelise and taste superb. Sprinkle the paprika over.
4. Wrap in buttered foil leaving it open along the top. Bake for 20-25 minutes at fan 200C/conventional 220C/gas 7 until the cheese has melted.,

instructions, 1. Combine all ingredients in a crock pot. Cook on Low for 6 hours or can be done on High for 3. Stir occasionally. Will turn a darker shade of red and have a nice sweet flavor and aroma. Can be done on the stove top but needs more constant attention.
2. I will throw it in the morning on low and leave it until dinner time (my crock pot keeps things warm until you shut it off) and it tastes wonderfully!
3. This sauce freezes beautifully so does the leftover puree. Can be frozen for up to 4-6 months. Can be reheated in the microwave or however you would like.,

instructions, 1. Combine the lard yeast and salt with the flour adding as much water as necessary to get a rather soft dough. Work it steadily for about 10 minutes Place it into a bowl previously sprinkled with olive oil cover with a woolen cloth and leave it to raise in a lukewarm place. After about 1 1/2 hours when the dough has leavened place it on a pastry board punch it with your hands to stop it swelling and flatten it out into a large square (about 15" x 24"). Spread on some lard and sprinkle with a lot of fresh cracked pepper.
2. Now add 1/4 lb each of chopped up salame and chopped up prosciutto. Sprinkle with coarsely grated pecorino romano or parmigiano. Roll up into a tube. Grease an angel food cake pan with lard and place tube inside (forming a ring).
3. Lay 5 eggs (wash them but do not boil them first) on top and top with a criss cross of dough (2 strips of dough forming an X laid on top to hold down the eggs). Let rise for another hour or more (again should be more than doubled). When ready place in oven at 375 - 400 F (185-200 C) until the top is nice and brown and looks ready. This normally takes about an hour to an hour and a half. The smell in your house should tell you it is ready (my mouth starts watering and I know it is time :-).
4. Now the hard part. Let bread cool. Place in a paper bag (NOT PLASTIC) and leave it for the following day (do not refrigerate). It really needs a day to get full flavor. Leftover is great toasted the following day or even topped with a mild cheese and tomato slices and toasted in the oven.,

2. In a large bowl combine bread crumbs eggs milk 1/2 cup of the Romano and the parsley and mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Add beef and gently combine being careful not to overwork the meat. Shape into bite-size meatballs. Roll each meatball in flour to coat shaking off excess.
3. In a large pot bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente about 8 minutes. Drain pasta in a colander and set aside. If not using immediately cover top with plastic wrap so that pasta does not dry out. Do not rinse pasta with water since you want to retain the pasta's natural starches so that the sauce will cling to the ziti.
4. In a large skillet heat the oil over medium-high heat. When almost smoking add meatballs in batches and without moving or turning the meat allow it to brown for about 3 minutes. Turn meatballs and brown other side. Continue to cook until all sides are golden brown. Remove meatballs to a plate.
5. In a large bowl combine the tomato sauce and ricotta and mix well. Add the cooked ziti and meatballs and toss gently.
6. In a large greased baking dish pour in pasta mixture. Sprinkle the mozzarella Parmesan and remaining Romano all over the top. Dot with the butter. Place baking dish on top of baking sheet covered with aluminum foil to collect any drippings from the dish. Bake until top is golden brown and bubbly about 30 to 40 minutes.,

2. Remove roast from skillet and place into slow cooker.
3. Place vegetables in bottom of crock pot. In a separate bowl mix the dry onion soup the tomatoes Italian seasoning sugar and red wine.  Pour this mixture over the roast.
4. Cover; cook on low setting for 6 to 7 hours or until roast and vegetables are tender.
5. If you would like a thicker sauce thicken the sauce one half hour before serving.  In a small jar with a lid place 2 tablespoons flour and 5 tablespoons water.  Cover and shake until there are no lumps.  Add this mixture to the crock pot stirring well and let the gravy thicken on its own for the last half hour.
6. I serve this dish with garlic cheese mashed potatoes and a simple green salad.  We never have any leftovers!  This is perfect for one of those busy work or shopping days as it practically makes itself.,

instructions, 1. Place a large saucepan over medium heat and melt the butter in the oil. Add the onion carrot celery and garlic with a good pinch of salt (about ½ teaspoon) and sauté for 5 minutes stirring often. Add the diced pancetta and cook for a further 10 minutes until vegetables are softened and pancetta is golden.
2. Increase the heat to high and add the meat a third at a time stirring and breaking lumps with a spoon between each addition. Adding the meat gradually allows the water to evaporate – which is key if you want to brown your meat and not boil it. After the last addition when no pink can be spotted in the meat and no lumps remain set a timer to 15 minutes. You want your meat to caramelize and even become crispy in spots. More water will evaporate and flavors will concentrate. You want golden bits of meat to stick to the bottom of your pan – this flavorful crust will then be deglazed with white wine. Watch over your pan as you don’t want your meat to burn. When you see some serious caramelization action happening lower heat to medium to reach the end of your 15-minute sautéing time (on my stove that’s after about 8-9 minutes).
3. Over medium heat pour the white wine into the sauce pan. With a wooden spoon scrape all the brown bits stuck to the bottom of your pan. Push the meat all around to make sure you scrape it all off. By the time you’re finished the wine will be evaporated (2-3 minutes). Be careful not to let the meat stick again (lower the heat if necessary).
4. Add milk diced tomatoes (with liquid) beef stock 1 teaspoon salt and a good grinding of pepper. Bring to a boil and then lower to the lowest heat and let simmer very slowly half-covered for 4 hours. Stir once in a while. If your sauce starts sticking before the end of your cooking time lower the heat (if possible) and/or add a bit of stock or water. In the end the sauce should be thick more oil- than water-based and thick like oatmeal. Adjust the seasoning one last time – don’t be afraid of adding more salt (tasting each time you add some) it is this recipe’s key seasoning.
5. To serve: Reheat the sauce. Mix in a knob or two of butter and about two generous tablespoons of freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano per serving – these last additions will produce an incredibly creamy flavor. Drain your pasta very well and return to the pot. Spoon some sauce just enough to coat the pasta. Serve in bowls with a few leaves of basil sprinkled on top and more freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano to taste.,

instructions, 1. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water and leave for 5 minutes.
2. While waiting sift the flour into your mixing bowl. Add the salt & oil.
3. Once a foam has formed on the yeasty water pour it in and start mixing. Add more water as required (varies depending on climate humidity etc.) until the dough feels like a young woman's breast. I was taught this by a baker many years ago and while it sounds rude it really is the easiest way to describe how a good dough should feel. Now clean your mixing bowl.
4. This next part while not vital does make a noticeable difference. Rub oil around the surface of the dough put it in your clean mixing bowl and stick it in the fridge. Leave it there for as long as possible (24 hours is best but 6 hours is ok). If you don't have time for the fridge don't stress - just skip it and move on.
5. If you used the fridge you will have noticed your dough rose albeit slowly. Take your dough out of the fridge and let it rise some more.
6. Once risen pound the crap out of it to flatten it again but don't knead it too much. Cut your dough into 3 or 4 balls roll them flat fold them up and roll them again. This creates air pockets which expand giving your base the authentic 5 star Italian wood-fired look and feel in the comfort of your own home. If the dough begins to feel tough while you're working it let it rest for 5 minutes. It's just the gluten tightening up and resting it relaxes it.
7. Top your bases and cook for 10 minutes or so. If you make thicker bases it often pays to partly cook the base for 5 min then top and bake again.
8. Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Start by burning one of the eggplants. This can be done one of several ways. On a gas stove the eggplant can be put directly on a moderate flame and roasted for 12-15 minutes (turning frequently with metal tongs) until the flesh is soft and smoky and the skin is burnt all over. To roast in the oven pierce the eggplant with a sharp knife in a few places. Put it on a foil-lined tray and place directly under a hot broiler for 45 minutes turning a few times. The aubergine needs to deflate completely and its skin should burn and break. It should look very wrinkly. Or you can use the grill and keep turning it about 20-25 minutes.
2. Once the eggplant is ready remove it from the heat and make a long cut through it. Scoop out the soft flesh while avoiding the skin. Discard the skin. Chop the flesh roughly and set aside.
3. Cut the other eggplant into a 1/2 inch dice leaving the skin on. Heat up 1/3 cup of the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the eggplant dice in batches until golden and crisp. (you may need more oil).Transfer to a colander and sprinkle with salt. Leave to cool.
4. Put the onion and remaining oil in a heavy pan and fry slowly until the onion is soft and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for a further 3 minutes. Turn up the heat and add the rice stirring to coat it in the oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes. Add the wine (it should hiss) and cook for 2-3 minutes or until nearly evaporated. Turn the heat down to medium.
5. Now start adding the hot stock to the rice a ladleful at a time waiting until each addition has been fully absorbed before adding the next and stirring all the time. When all the stock has been added remove the pan from the heat. Add half of the lemon zest the lemon juice grilled aubergine flesh butter most of the parmesan and about 3/4 teaspoon salt. Stir well then cover and set aside untouched for 5 minutes. Taste and add more salt if you like plus black pepper.
6. To serve spoon the risotto into shallow bowls and sprinkle with the diced eggplant the remaining parmesan the basil and the remaining lemon zest.,

instructions, 1. Blanch the asparagus and shock in ice water to stop the cooking process. Once cool cut the asparagus into bite sized pieces and set aside.
2. In 3-quart skillet add the butter olive oil shallot and garlic over low-medium heat. Gently saute for 2 minutes.
3. Add arborio rice. Saute ingredients until the rice begins to turn translucent leaving a white dot in the middle.
4. Once the rice begins to turn translucent add the white wine and sun-dried tomatoes then saute on medium for 2 minutes.
5. Slowly (1/4 cup at a time) add stock to the rice. Once the rice has soaked up the majority of the liquid in the skillet add more. This is a slow process and can easily take 30 minutes (or more) to go through all the liquid. Warning: If you add too much liquid too quickly you may end up with a risotto that is not as creamy as it should be.
6. When you’ve reached the point where you’ve added 3 1/2 cups of stock to the rice add the asparagus parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes.
7. Once the rice has become a nice creamy and tender texture (sample the rice and it should be tender without any crunch but still firm) add your shrimp with the last 1/4 cup of stock and cook until shrimp are thoroughly cooked but tender and almost all liquid is absorbed. This should take 3-5 minutes. Also at this time add the juice of one half of a lemon.
8. Salt and pepper to taste.,

instructions, 1. Making the Crêpe Filling: Add the oil to a pan over a medium heat and when it is hot reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the bell pepper stirring until it is softened add the garlic and cook the mixture stirring for 1 minute. In a bowl stir together the bell pepper mixture the ricotta and 1/3 cup of the Parmesan with salt and pepper to taste and let the filling cool.
2. Making the Crêpe Batter: In a blender or food processor blend the flour the broth the eggs the butter and the salt for 5 seconds. Turn off the motor with a rubber spatula scrape down the sides of the container and blend the batter for 20 seconds more. Transfer the batter to a bowl stir in the herbs and let the batter stand covered for 1 hour. The batter may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. This makes enough batter for about 12 crêpes.
3. Making the Herbed Crêpes: Heat a crepe pan or non-stick skillet measuring 6" to 7" across the bottom over moderate heat until it is hot. Brush the pan lightly with the butter heat it until it is hot but not smoking and remove it from the heat. Stir the batter half fill a 1/4-cup measure with it and pour the batter into the pan. Tilt and rotate the pan quickly to cover the bottom with a layer of batter and return any excess batter to the bowl. Return the pan to the heat loosen the edge of the crêpe with a spatula and cook the crêpe for 1 minute or until the top appears almost dry. Turn the crêpe cook the other side lightly and transfer the crêpe to a plate. Make the rest of the crêpes with the remaining batter in the same manner brushing the pan lightly with butter as necessary. The crêpes may be made 3 days in advance kept stacked with a sheet of greaseproof paper between each crêpe wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled.
4. Assembling the Crêpes: Spread about 2 tablespoons of the filling on each crêpe and roll up jelly-roll fashion. Arrange the crêpes seam sides down in a buttered shallow baking dish just large enough to hold them in one layer brush them lightly with the butter and sprinkle them with the remaining Parmesan. Bake the crêpes in the middle of a preheated 400°F oven for 20 minutes and serve them with the sauce.
5. Making the Tomato Sauce: Roughly chop the canned tomatoes in the can with the edge of a spoon then add them with the juice to a pan stir in the salt the sugar the tomato paste the basil and the cayenne bring the mixture to a boil and simmer it stirring for 20 minutes. Add the fresh tomatoes and cook the mixture for 5 minutes. Serve the sauce warm. Makes about 1 1/4 cups.
6. Notes: If you want this to be a vegetarian dish use vegetable broth.  For variation or if you prefer use spinach in place of the green pepper. If you like your food spicy add half a fresh jalapeno pepper to the tomato sauce.,

instructions, 1. Brown ground beef in a pan with a splash of water stirring frequently to break it up into very small pieces.
2. Meanwhile saute the onions in oil in a large saucepan.  When they have turned limp and transparent add the garlic and cook for a further minute or two.
3. Add the beef to the vegetables.  Stir in the sugar tomatoes and tomato paste.  You may also need to add in some water to obtain the correct consistency - this needs to be a bit thinner than a traditional pasta sauce.  Simmer for about an hour.
4. With about 15 or 20 minutes left check the consistency of the sauce again.  Add water if required as well as seasonings.
5. Preheat oven to 350°F.
6. Melt butter in a small saucepan.
7. Add flour and 1 cup of milk to a sealable jar and shake well until the flour is distributed throughout the milk.  Add this mixture slowly to the butter stirring constantly.  Repeat with remaining milk and paprika.
8. Continue heating stirring constantly until the sauce begins to thicken.  Again this does not need to be a thick sauce.
9. Cook ziti for about 7 minutes in a pot of salted boiling water.  The ziti will only be about half cooked at this point.  Drain reserving about a cup of water to thin the sauce if necessary.
10. Mix the pasta with tomato sauce bechamel sauce and mozzarella cheese.  Stir well to combine and melt cheese.  There should be enough sauce to just cover the pasta.  Pour the mixture into a large baking dish.
11. If you have some tomato sauce left spoon it lightly over top of the pasta for a bit of extra colour.  Sprinkle with parmesan cover and bake for about 40 minutes.  The pasta will finish cooking during this time and the excess liquid will be absorbed!
12. Allow to stand for a few minutes before serving.,

instructions, 1. Chop or break the broccoli into very small pieces. Bring a large pot of water to boil. Break apart the lasagna noodles into small pieces (kind of up to you how big you want them) and cook them for as long as directed on the package. When the noodles are almost done add the broccoli to the pot and cook it for 2-3 minutes or until the broccoli is bright green and tender-crisp. Drain the water and set aside the noodles and broccoli.
2. Mince the garlic and onion. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Saute the garlic and onion with the olive oil. When the onion and garlic are fragrant and soft (about 2-3 minutes) add the rinsed and drained beans. Season very generously with salt and pepper or red pepper if desired and cook for a few minutes until the beans are warm. Add the bean mixture to the lasagna/broccoli pot.
3. Add sauce to the pot and stir to combine. Cook over medium heat for just a few minutes until warmed all the way through. Top each serving with a generous dollop of ricotta.,

instructions, 1. MY SIMPLE LASAGNA RULES  --  After making the sauce ricotta and grated all your cheese this makes things easy.  FIRST Rule of Thumb  --  Divide your meat sauce into 4 amounts and set aside.  This way you will have the right amount of sauce for each layer.  SECOND Rule of Thumb  --  Divide your ricotta mix into 2 amounts and set aside.  THIRD Rule of Thumb  --  Mix the parmesan and mozarella together and divide in 3 amounts and set aside.  Now you are ready.
2. Ricotta Mix  --  Just add the ricotta and cottage cheese along with the eggs and nutmeg to a small bowl and mix well and set to the side.
3. Grated Cheese  --  Mix the mozzarella parmesan and romano together and set to the side as well.
4. Meat Sauce  --  In a large sauce pan on medium heat add the olive oil ground turkey and the ground sausage.  Saute on medium heat breaking up the meat as it cooks until the meat is golden brown.  Once done remove the meat to a plate covered with a paper towel to let it drain.
5. NOTE:  As I mentioned I do not like a dry lasagna so I add 2 1/2 cans of the tomatoes.  I really prefer my lasagna to be moist and I think this really works.  If I have a bit more meat I may add all 3 cans but I usually use right out 2 1/2 cans. But sometimes I may use another pan which is slightly larger so all 3 cans are needed.  Just use your own judgment and you should be fine.
6. In the same pan with the drippings add the garlic onion and red pepper flakes and cook on medium low to lightly saute the onion until tender. Just a couple of minutes is all. Add in the tomato paste tomatoes roasted red peppers fresh and dried herbs salt and pepper and simmer for about 20 minutes. Add the beef and sausage back in and you are done.
7. Layers  --  Now the fun starts.  In a 13x9" pan sprayed with a non stick spray and the oven preheated to 375 degrees on the middle shelf.
8. 1) 1/4 of your meat sauce on the bottom;   2) 4-5 noodles to cover the sauce;  3) 1/4 of the meat sauce;  4) 1/2 ricotta mix;  5) 1/3 grated cheese;  6) 4-5 noodles;  7) 1/4 meat sauce;  8) 1/2 ricotta mix;  9) 1/3 grated cheese;  10) 4-5 noodles;  11) 1/4 meat sauce;  12) 1/3 grated cheese.
9. Bake  --  Cover with foil and bake 45-50 minutes. The last 15 minutes I remove the foil. Cook until golden brown and bubbly.  Remove from the oven and put the foil back on very loose and let set at least 15 minutes before serving.
10. Serve  --  Cut and ENJOY!  Me - TRADITIONAL caesar salad and crusty garlic bread.  It is just what I love best with lasagna.,

instructions, 1. Heat your oven to 325°F.
2. In a dry skillet over medium heat toast the fennel seeds and red chili flakes until their aroma begins to smell smoky and more pronounced.  Do not let them burn.  Remove them from heat and grind them in a coffee or spice grinder with 1 teaspoon -each- of dried basil marjoram and thyme.  Set this spice blend aside.
3. In a skillet over medium heat sauté the three ounces Vidalia onions green bell pepper and celery in 1 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil.
4. Season the vegetables with 1/4 teaspoon -each- of salt and black pepper.  (Adjust to reflect personal tastes.)  Add 5 cloves of minced garlic and continue to sauté until the vegetables are completely softened.
5. Add the three tablespoons skim milk to the vegetables and cook to further soften them until all the milk appears to have been absorbed.
6. Remove the vegetables from heat and cool for a few minutes.
7. In a bowl mix the ground chicken 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1 egg 1 ounce parmesan cheese and the spice blend (see step 2 above) with a wooden spoon.  Blend thoroughly.
8. Add the cooled vegetables and stir them in to the chicken mixture completely incorporating the them.
9. Keeping one hand dry form small golf-ball sized balls (about 1-1/2 inches in diameter) from the meat and roll in the flour.  Roll the floured meatballs in your hand to remove the excess.  (NOTE:  You will probably use a cup of flour but only an ounce or so will stick to the meatballs when you knock off the excess.)  This will make approximately 20 meatballs.
10. In a skillet over medium heat 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil until hot.  Add the meatballs (do not over-crowd; do this in several batches if necessary) and lightly brown them on one side first before flipping them over and doing the other.  Each side should take about 3 minutes.
11. When all the meatballs have been browned set them aside and -in the skillet where they were browned- sauté 3 minced garlic cloves and the 1 ounce of minced shallot.  Add the diced tomatoes teaspoon of both marjoram and thyme and the 1/4 teaspoon of both salt and black pepper.  Mix together and bring to a simmer.
12. Simmer uncovered for 5 minutes.
13. Place the browned meatballs in a baking dish and pour the tomato mixture over them.  Put the meatballs and sauce in the oven for 45 minutes.
14. Remove the finished meatballs place them on a platter and garnish with 1 ounce grated parmesan cheese and 1 ounce finely chopped green onion.

instructions, 1. In a nice large pot WITH a secure lid start up your stove top and place in just enough olive oil to coat pan.
2. Start off by sautéing the garlic carrots and celery for a few minutes You dont want they cooked however. Just enough to start the process.  Then add the two cans of S&W Italian Stewed Tomatoes. It is important that you use Italian Stewed Tomatoes (preferably S&W brand if you can) rather than canned tomato sauce as it will effect the taste a great deal.  If you cant find Italian Stewed Tomatoes -- just wing it. Make it your own! The pieces will be in large chunks. DON'T blend it up! Just simply poor it out onto your hand on the way into the pan (obviously have well washed hands) and crush the chunks with your hands as it goes it. That's the fun part!
3. When it gets to a simmer again add 1 1/2 cups of red wine. I recommend swirling the red wine around the cans of I.S. Tomatoes so that you can get every last bit of it out. It might seem like a lot of wine but remember the amount of time it will be simmering will help reduce it a lot.
4. Then add the seasonings starting with the whole bay leaves EXCEPT the fresh chopped parsley. Stir it all up and allow to come to a high simmer. Just bellow a boil.   Then turn it down again. At this point I recommend putting the lid on and weighing it down for a firm fit. If you have a pressure cooker use that!  Slow cookers work great too but I recommend starting off in a pot and then switching over to the slow cooker.
5. Allow to cook for approx and hour then test the flavor. Remember it WILL change after cooking the full time. You can usually tell at this point if its going to be bland or just right though.
6. Put the lid back on at an angle (to allow venting). Pour the remaining 1/2 cup of wine into a glass for yourself go sit on the couch and look extremely exhausted. After all cooking a fancy dinner requires A LOT of work.  Make sure your family knows it too as the aroma of your homemade sauce wafts around the house. Put in a movie I recommend something like Chocolat or Under the Tuscan Sun --  You will like it and it will keep the men folk out of the kitchen while you cook. If you ARE a man--football or something--I don't know? What do men who cook watch?.
7. Stir frequently. If it appears to be getting too hot (IE burning to bottom of pan) TURN IT DOWN. Love your sauce don't leave it injured.  Allow approx 6 hours to cook over the stove top (more if your using a slow cooker after all -- it's ummm --  "slow").  Taste regularly.  I also take a loaf of French bread slicing it open so it hinges at the side add minced garlic and olive oil wrap it in aluminum foil and heat in the oven for a few minutes right before dinner is to be served.
8. When sauce is ready start water boiling for the noodles. I recommend whole wheat noodles but you can use any kind your heart desires.
9. You will know the sauce is ready when it thickens up and is still nice and chunky. If you have a thick paste that's stuck to the bottom of the pan then you had too much red wine and forgot about your sauce. Don't panic--add water and talk to it beg it to be ok. Sometimes it comes around. If all has gone well however you will have a glorious sauce whose aroma fills your house and it will bring your family to the table on its own--no ringing bell necessary.
10. To serve strain noodles (DON'T rinse!) put them back in the pot in which they were cooked. Ladle in about 2-3 ladles of sauce (depending on how much noodles you cooked). Remove the bay leaves as you find them. Toss the noodles to coat them with sauce. Plate out the noodles. Put a little sauce on the top. Chop the fresh parsley; toss over the top of each one. Shave fresh parmesan cheese over the top. Cut up bread if you desired to make it put it in a basket wrapped in a towel.
11. Enter dinning room carrying a plate in each hand.  Look so exhausted that you couldn't possibly do the dishes. ;).,

5. Generously cover the mushrooms with mozzarella.
6. Bake 8-10 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the French bread is golden brown. Lay the top halves of the French bread on the bottom halves to make sandwiches. I also tried it in the panini maker which was faster and tasted the same but the cheese didn't melt quite like the original. Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Traditional Method:
2. Mix warm water 1 tsp sugar and yeast together and let sit for ten minutes or so (or until foamy) to proof the yeast.
3. Sift together flour sugar cinnamon lemon rind salt.  Place in a large bowl and make a hole in the middle of the dry mixture.
4. In a separate small bowl beat 3 eggs and add in the canola oil the yeast mixture and the Grand Marnier (if you're using it) and mix it all together and dump it into the hole you created in the center of the dry mixture.
5. Work with this as you would pizza dough.  Slowly beat in flour with a fork and when it is stiff enough to knead put flour on your hands so it doesn't stick and add in the rest of the flour.  Once all the flour is incorporated you may want to transfer the dough to a floured surface to continue kneading.
6. Decide whether you want to shape the dough into on large loaf (in which case you will need to place it into a GREASED lasagna-sized pan to rise and bake) or whether you want to try placing it in 2 or 3 GREASED loaf pans.  I personally only make one loaf thus I don't know the baking times for the smaller loaves.  If you make it in a large pan you should shape the dough into a circle so that it grows into a nice shape since it will not quite "grow" into the pan.
7. SEE INFORMATION ABOUT BAKING AND RISING UNDER THE BREAD MACHINE INSTRUCTIONS.
8. Bread Machine Method:
9. Place ingredients in bread machine in the order recommended in your bread machine's manual (My order was: water 3 beaten eggs oil liqueur (if using) 2 cups flour 1 tsp cinnamon 1 cup sugar lemon rind 2 cups flour yeast (in a whole formed in the flour) salt and sugar (1 tsp) along the edges of the pan.
10. I put it on the dough cycle just until it finished kneading (about 35 minutes or so) as I wanted it to rise in the pan I would be baking it inches.
11. Turn it onto a floured surface to shape it and place it in a greased pan (see note above  under traditional method concerning options on pan size).
12. Baking and Rising instructions for both methods:
13. Take the greased pan or pans and cover them with a clean dish cloth and put in a warm place to rise for 4 hours.  I usually let the stove warm slightly while I am working with the dough turn off the heat and put it in there to rise but be careful not to let the oven get too hot.  It only needs to be warm not hot.
14. After 4 hours take dough out of oven and pre-heat oven to 300. At this point beat an egg and brush it over the top of the loaf/loaves.
15. If you have shaped the dough into one large bread it will take between 45 minutes and 1 hour to bake.  When it is done the top will be somewhere between a golden colour and a dark brown.  Mine took about 55 minutes this year.
16. If you have gone with the smaller loaves you will simply have to keep an eye on things since I am not sure how long they would take to bake.  I would estimate about 30 minutes.,

instructions, 1. Make the dough from the flour and the eggs (like a bread dough) and put it in a bowl cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit until it has risen.
2. In the mean time blanch the cabbage drain it squeezing well to extract moisture and mince it. Then sauté it until done in the butter. Take out the cabbage and set aside.
3. Brown the sausage and when brown add cooked meats together and heat until hot.
4. Mince the cooked meats quite finely (if need be you can blend them but be careful not to make a paste). Combine all the ingredients of the filling in a bowl and mix them thoroughly with your fingers to obtain a homogenous mixture seasoning it to taste with salt pepper and nutmeg.
5. Take the pasta dough and roll it out dime-thin. Cut the sheet into two equal-sized pieces dust one lightly with corn meal roll it up and cover it so it stays moist.
6. Dot the half of the sheet still on your work surface with blebs of filling about the size of a small hazelnut putting the dots in rows that are about an inch apart (I have seen agnolotti that are smaller).
7. Unroll the other sheet shake off the corn meal and lay it over the first.
8. Tamp the sheet down well around the filling so it sticks and cut the agnolotti free with a serrated pasta wheel.
9. Come time to cook them heat the butter in a pan with the sage and remove it from the flames when the sage begins to whisper (you don't want to brown the butter or burn the sage).
10. In the meantime bring broth to a boil.
11. Boil the agnolotti in broth skimming them off into a serving bowl as soon as they rise to the surface.
12. Season them with the butter and sage and serve with freshly grated cheese and thinly sliced truffle if you have it.,

cuisine, European >> Italian >> Italian, 
time, ,

instructions, 1. Sausage and Vegetables  --  In a large saute pan add the sausage and brown until cooked through.  I like to use bulk sausage but you can used links and just remove the casing.  Just brown  and then move to a plate with a paper towel on it to drain.  In the pan dripping from the sausage saute all the vegetables and garlic. If necessary you can add a little extra olive oil but you shouldn't need to.  Once the vegetables are tender but not overdone  --  add the tomatoes breaking them up as you add them tomato paste and vegetable broth.  Add the herbs and any salt and pepper needed.  Add the sausage back in and let simmer 5-10 minutes.
2. Polenta  --  Slice the polenta in thin slices. Most grocery stores carried the prepared polenta in tubes which is a great time saver.  They have plain herb cheese many flavors.  I love to use parmesan for this but it is not necessary.  There are enough other flavors in this dish.  You will need around 18 slices for this dish.  Now in a small square casserole dish 9x9x2 or you can use something similar in size build the casserole.
3. Combine  --  Add some of your meat and vegetable sauce then add the layers of the polenta you can over lap them then the cheese.  Another layer of the sauce the polenta rounds and cheese.  Finish with sauce and cheese.
4. Bake  --  I like to let it set at room temp until the polenta soaks up some of the sauce about 1 hour then bake covered at 350 for about 30 minutes until bubbly and the cheese is melted.,

instructions, 1. Heat the milk in the microwave until it is just warm to the touch. Add 1 tsp of sugar and the yeast. Stir and set aside.
2. In a large bowl combine the rice flour cornstarch xanthan gum salt rosemary garlic powder oregano and 2 tsp of sugar.
3. The yeast mixture should have some bubbles at the top. If it doesn't throw it out and remix. If it does have bubbles add the olive oil and cider vinegar.
4. Pour the yeast mixture into the flour mixture and stir to combine.
5. Prepare your pan by greasing it and sprinkling it with rice flour. Pour out your dough and add enough rice flour so that it is workable. Starting in the center work the dough out to the sides of the pan using your fingers.
6. Once your crust is spread out lightly coat it with olive oil to prevent drying and let it rise in a warm area for 40-60 minutes.
7. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Cook the crust without toppings for 8 minutes.
8. Remove the crust and top it as you wish. Return the pizza to the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes until the cheese is nice and melty.
9. NOTE: I like to top a pizza stone with parchment paper and spread out the dough on it. Then I can slide the parchment paper off and let the crust rise while I stick the pizza stone in the oven to preheat. The crust gets a great texture this way. I've never made this recipe on a regular pizza pan so I look forward to reading your reviews.,

Slip the cutlets into the pan and fry for 5 minutes on each side until golden turning once – do this in batches if the pieces don't fit comfortably in the pan. Remove the chicken to a large platter in a single layer to keep warm.

Stir in the butter and return the chicken to the pan; simmer gently for 1 minute to heat the chicken through. Season with salt and pepper and garnish with chopped parsley before serving.,

instructions, 1. In a ziploc bag big enough to hold at least 1 cutlet at a time mix your breadcrumbs and parmesan. You want to try and make sure it's evenly distributed so there are big clumps up cheese or breadcrumbs clouding your chicken.
2. In a frying pan heat your EVOO over med-high heat and get it nice and hot when you put your cutlets in you want a good sizzle going. In another pot bring your spaghetti water to a boil. If you're heating your pasta sauce on the stove go ahead and start warming that too.
3. Put your cutlets one at a time in the bag with your breading and shake until evenly coated. place each cutlet in the hot oil pan. When your pasta water is at a boil drop your spaghetti inches.
4. Once the side down in the pan turns a nice dark golden brown color turn your cutlets and let them brown on the other side and cook. You can safely eat your chicken when the juices run clear and there isn't any pink on the inside. When it's finished let it rest for a moment on some paper towels to soak up any loose oil. An easy way to test if the pasta ready is to do the old trick of throwing a piece at the wall :) If it sticks its ready and you can be sure it won't stain! Drain your pasta and mix a little bit of sauce in to flavor it and prevent sticking to the pot.
5. Serve up your pasta with some nice hot Tomato and Basil sauce on top. Then put a cutlet on top of that. You could even take a tiny bit of fresh basil and put that on the plate to make a beautiful garnish. Enjoy!,

Add salt pepper oregano and basil. Cook for a further 5- 10 minutes on a low heat until mushrooms start to change in color (Do not over cook the veggies as they will cook through in the oven). Add the crushed tomatoes and simmer for a further 5 minutes. Taste and check if the seasoning needs adjusting. Turn off the heat when tomatoes have heated through thoroughly.
3. Meanwhile in another pan add the butter. Keep the heat low and once the butter has melted add the flour. Stir the flour and butter until there are no remnants of raw flour. (You should have a very thick cake batter consistency). Slowly stir in all the milk bit by bit into the flour mixture. Make sure you keep stirring with a whisk. (Do not worry if you end up with lumps. If this happens just pour the mixture over a sieve and transfer the mixture back onto the stove). Add the pepper and nutmeg stir making sure the heat is kept low. The end mixture should thicken enough to coat the back of a spoon.
4. In a baking dish spoon half  of the tomato mixture inches Layer the lasagne pasta over this layer. Spoon half the bechamel sauce over the pasta. Layer half the aubergines over this. Pour the rest of the tomato mixture inches Add another layer of pasta. Layer the aubergines over the pasta this time and then top with the rest of the bechamel sauce. Sprinkle the cheddar cheese on the top.
5. Place in the oven at 350 degrees for  40 minutes or until cheese is throughly toasted.,

instructions, 1. Combine Yeast Water and Sugar in a large bowl and stir to dissolve Yeast. Let stand 5 minutes then add: Salt Cornmeal Whole Wheat Flour and Oil and stir.
2. Gradually add white Flour Stirring with a wooden spoon until a stiff dough has formed. Place dough on a floured board and knead several minutes adding only enough flour to keep dough from sticking. (I’ve always had luck using only the 2 ½ cups White Flour so I used the other cup while kneading the dough.).
3. When dough is smooth and shiny transfer to a bowl that has been brushed with olive oil. To prevent a skin from forming on the dough brush or mist the top with Olive Oil and cover bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise for 1 ½ to 2 hours.
4. Punch down knead briefly and let the dough rise once again for 40 minutes. Heat the grill if using charcoal. If using Gas just fire it up about five minutes before you’re ready to cook.
5. Punch down dough and if it’s sticky knead in a little more flour kneading a full 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 6 pieces and roll into balls. Mist / brush with Olive oil and let stand 5 minutes to relax.
6. Put 1 round of dough on a cutting board or counter top brushed / misted with Olive Oil. Press the dough until it’s about 1/8th inch thick. (Don’t be too obsessive about the shape mine come out as a bunch of individual random shapes.).
7. When the fire is hot you should be able to hold your hand 5 inches above the grill for about 3 seconds. Pick up the dough and drape it onto the grill. After several seconds use the tongs to turn the dough around so that all the sides heat evenly. You want the underside to get evenly speckled brown with if you dare a couple of nearly black spots.
8. Flip the pizza over and pull it off the heat to the table top or to the cooler side of the grill. (If I’m doubling or tripling the recipe for a dinner party I first make all the crusts misting with the Olive Oil on the uncooked side as they come off and stacking them.) Brush the pizza with Olive Oil. Spread the top (already cooked side) with a small amount of garlic. Spread the top with 3 -5 Tbsp Tomato Sauce spreading around with the back of the spoon making a very thin coating that maybe doesn’t even cover the entire pizza. Add the rest of the ingredients Basil Green Onion Pepperoni and Cheeses as desired and put back onto the grill for about 2 minutes more. If Cheese needs more melting put on cooler side of the grill up a level on the grill’s rack or broil in an oven whatever works?!?,

2. Place semolina and all-purpose flours in work bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment. Add the salt and 2 tbsp of sesame seeds. Mix briefly to combine.
3. Make a well in the pile of flour and add the proofed yeast the remaining water and the olive oil. Start the mixer on low speed until everything comes together and starts to get smooth about 2 minutes. Increase to medium and knead another 2-3 minutes until it begins to look velvety and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead by hand until smooth and elastic (about 30 turns about 1 minute). Grease a clean mixing bowl with olive oil and place the dough into it turning the dough over to coat both sides.
5. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm dark spot until it triples in volume about 2 1/2 hours. (Alternatively place dough in an oiled airtight plastic container at least twice the size of the dough mass and refrigerate overnight. Bring to room temperature before proceeding).
6. Preheat oven to 400°F Coat 2 baking sheets each with 1 1/2 to 2 tbsp olive oil.
7. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board. Cut dough in 6 equal pieces. Cover the unused pieces with a damp kitchen towel.
8. Cut each piece into 4 or 5 equal pieces each about the size of a medium walnut (3/4 to 1 ounce each). Using both hands roll each piece against the board until it forms a 12 to 14 inch rope. Do not flour the board; the stickiness helps the dough stretch out.
9. Place the rope on the baking sheet rolling it to coat with oil. Spaced 1/2 inch apart each sheet should hold 10 to 12 breadsticks.
10. When all the breadsticks are made coat with sesame seeds: pour the seeds into a long narrow pile as long as the bread sticks and twice as wide. Starting with the first breadstick (which will be most relaxed and easiest to work with) roll each breadstick in the sesame seeds coating well then return it to the sheet pan. Sprinkle each with a bit of kosher salt and let rest 10 minutes.
11. Bake 14-20 minutes. Halfway through turn each sheet pan 180° in the oven and swap racks to ensure even browning. They are done when they are an even light golden brown (the ends may be a little darker). Cool completely on the baking sheets. Store in an airtight container up to 2 weeks.,

instructions, 1. Place the flour semolina and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse several times to combine the ingredients.
2. Add the egg all at once and process for 30 seconds drizzling the oil through the opening in the lid. The dough should look like coarse wet sand.
3. Dust a work surface generously with semolina.
4. Transfer the dough to the work surface and bring it together in a ball.
5. Knead the dough for a good 3 or 4 minutes using the heels of your hands to push it away from you again and again and occasionally rotating the dough 180 degrees. The dough should appear smooth and silky when you are done; it should not be sticky.
6. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes.
7. Set up the pasta maker next to a work surface.
8. Sprinkle a rimmed baking sheet liberally with semolina.
9. Sprinkle the work surface with semolina. You'll need to keep it dusted with semolina at all times so the pasta doesn't stick as you roll and cut it.
10. When ready to roll out the pasta cut it into quarters. Work with one quarter at a time and keep the remaining portions wrapped.
11. Use your fingers to work the dough into a rough 3-by-4-inch rectangle. (The dough should have the texture of Play-Doh.).
12. Use the heel of your hand to flatten the dough to a thickness of 1/2 inch.
13. Pass the dough through the highest (thickest) setting of your pasta machine.
14. Fold it into thirds as you would a business letter then flatten it to 1/2 inch and pass it through the machine again. Fold press and roll one more time.
15. Set the rollers on the next-highest setting and pass the dough through twice. (You don't have to fold it.).
16. Continue to lower the setting one increment at a time passing the dough through twice each time until your dough reaches the desired thickness.
17. Setting 3 is good for fettuccine and lasagna sheets.
18. Setting 2 is good for filled pastas such as tortellini ravioli and agnolotti or for thinner lasagna sheets.
19. Use plenty of semolina to keep the dough from sticking to itself as it falls into accordion folds while coming out of the rollers.
20. If you're making filled pastas make them as you go one sheet at a time. (If you roll all the sheets beforehand they will dry out and might tear as you try to work with them.).
21. If you’re not making filled pasta use a knife to slice the sheets into lasagna noodles or use your machine’s cutters to make fettuccine or spaghetti.
22. Use plenty of semolina as you stack lasagna noodles (alternate the layers lengthwise and crosswise) or form piles of cut pasta fluffing them with semolina so they remain separate.
23. Transfer the finished pasta to the prepared baking sheet as you work.
24. TO FREEZE: When you have finished rolling and cutting all the pasta transfer the baking sheet to the freezer for an hour or two until the pasta is frozen. Wrap it in plastic or store in resealable food storage bags and freeze for up to a month. (It is a good idea to weigh the pasta and freeze it in portions.).
25. MAKE AHEAD: The dough can be made a few days in advance wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and frozen. The uncooked pasta can be frozen in portions for up to 1 month.
26. NOTE: Depending on the humidity the size of your eggs and the brand of flour you are using you might have to adjust the amount of oil you add to achieve the desired texture. Weighing the flour and the eggs rather than relying on our uneven American measuring methods leads to more consistent results.
27. NOTE: To make saffron fettuccine combine the oil with a half-teaspoon of saffron threads in a small bowl and microwave on HIGH for 30 seconds. Allow the oil to cool then add it and the threads to the dough.,

instructions, 1. Mix all of the water yeast salt and sugar in a stand mixer with 2 cups of the bread flour and mix the ingredients for 1 or 2 minutes or until they have totally mixed and the dough looks like a batter. Allow dough (batter) to sit covered with a towel for 20 minutes to autolyse.
2. Once the 20 minutes are up add a dough hook onto the mixer and kneed for 5 minutes on med-low. This will not look like its doing much but it is agitating the hydrated flour and will help form gluten.
3. Add in another cup of flour and kneed again for five minutes.
4. Once the five miuntes are up check the dough if it is pulling away from the sides or has formed a ball on the hook your done but if it is still clinging to the bowl slowly add the remaining cup of flour till it totally pulls away but is still a little sticky to the touch.
5. Once it has formed a ball cover and let sit for another 20 minutes.
6. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured bench roll into 3 balls. You might have to dust the tops with flour because the dough will probably be sticky to the touch.

instructions, 1. This recipe uses Bubba's Frozen All-Beef 1/3 lb Hamburger patties made from U.S.D.A. Choice Beef Chuck cooked on an indoor electric grill. You can use smaller patties but you will need to adjust your cooking time accordingly. Burgers with fillers or lesser quality beef are not recommended. You'll be rewarded for spending a bit extra for quality hamburger patties.
2. Spray your electric grill with garlic flavored cooking spray. Close and heat for 5 minutes.
3. After 5 minutes place your frozen patties on your grill. Close and cook for 3 minutes.
4. While your burgers are cooking cover the insides of each bun with butter and garlic. Place your buns buttered sides up in an un-greased non-stick baking pan and set them aside for the moment. If you prefer you can use sliced Italian Bread instead of Hamburger Buns.
5. When your burgers have cooked for 3 minutes open your grill season both sides of each pattie with Italian Seasoning. Close your grill and cook 3 more minutes.
6. After the additional 3 minutes have passed open your grill and place a whole onion slice over each burger. Sprinkle a bit more Italian seasoning over each onion slice. Close your burger and cook for a final 2 minutes.
7. While your burger is finishing off heat your sauce in a glass cooking bowl in your microwave for about 2 1/2 minutes. Any good quality sauce will work. I used Classico Four Cheese Sauce.
8. Take the baking sheet your hamburger Buns are on and insert it into your oven. Toast the buns with the broiler for  a few minutes until the butter melts.
9. When your burgers are done and your sauce is heated remove your patties from your grill and place them in your sauce. Top each pattie liberally with shredded Italian cheese. Spoon sauce over the patties until they are covered then place the bowl in the microwave and heat on high for about 1 minute (until the cheese melts).
10. When your cheese is melted lift each burger from your sauce allow excess sauce to drip off then place each on the bottom portions of your buns and sprinkle with grated Parmesan Cheese. Lightly spoon about a teaspoon of sauce on the inside top portion of your bun. Serve your Sandwiches open-faced with a few celery sticks (no fries or potato chips) fresh spring onions and/or Roma Tomato slices on the side. Your guests can put their sandwiches together as they marvel about the savory aroma and your artful presentation. Have extra patties available. Your guests will want more.,
