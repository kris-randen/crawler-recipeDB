instructions, 1. Dissolve the honey in the water in a large mixing bowl and stir in the yeast. Set the mixture aside until the yeast forms a creamy layer on top about 15 minutes. Stir in the salt 2/3 cup of olive oil and beaten eggs. Add the flour 1 cup at a time until the dough is slightly tacky but not sticky wet.
2. Turn it out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic about 10 minutes. Lightly oil a bowl place the dough in the bowl turn the dough over a few times to oil the surface then let rise until doubled in a warm draft-free place about 90 minutes.
3. To make the loaves punch down the dough and cut it into 2 equal-sized pieces. Cut the first piece into 4 equal parts. Set the second piece aside under a cloth to prevent drying out while you braid the first loaf.
4. To braid the first 4-strand loaf roll the 4 pieces of dough into thin ropes about the width of your thumb and about 14 inches long. Make the tops and bottoms of each rope thinner than the middle area. Pinch the tops of the 4 ropes together and fan the 4 ropes out so they don't touch.
5. To make an "under-2 over-1 braid"  take the left-most rope and move it to the right to cross underneath the next 2 ropes then move it left to cross back over the strand immediately to its left. Take the far right strand and move it to the left and cross it under the two strands to its left (they are already crossed from the previous braid); then move it right to cross back over the strand immediately to its right. Repeat until the 4 strands are braided together all the way to the end and pinch the ends tightly together. Repeat  the steps to braid the second loaf and let the braided loaves rise for 1 hour.
6. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.
7. Make a glaze by whisking together the milk 2 tablespoons of olive oil the egg white and the sugar in a bowl. Brush the braided loaves with the glaze to make a shiny crust and bake the loaves on the prepared baking sheets in the preheated oven until they are light golden brown about 30 minutes.,

instructions, 1. Soak the casing in cold water for about an hour to soften it and loosen the salt in which it is packed. Place the wide end of the sausage stuffer up against the sink faucet and run cold water through the inside of the casing to remove excess salt.
2. Cut the meat and fat into 1/2-inch wide chunks. Pass them once through the coarse blade of a meat grinder. In a large bowl mix together the ground pork and fat with the garlic salt pepper cayenne thyme paprika bay leaf sage and hickory smoke. A wooden spoon works well.
3. Cut the casing into 26 inch lengths and tie a small knot in one end of each. Fit the open end over the tip of the sausage stuffer and slide it on until the tip of the stuffer touches the knot. The casing will look like accordion folds. This keeps excess air from getting into the casings. Fit the stuffer onto the meat grinder or according the directions that come with the stuffer or hold the wide end of the stuffer against or over the opening by hand.
4. Fill the hopper with the sausage mixture. Turn the machine on if it is electric  and feed the stuffing   gradually into the hopper; for a manual machine push the stuffing  through with a wooden pestle. The sausage casing will fill and inflate gradually. Stop filling about 1 1/4 inches from the funnel end and slip the casing off the funnel smoothing out any bumps carefully with your fingers and being careful not to push the stuffing out of the casing. Tie off the open end of the sausage tightly with a piece of string or make a knot in the casing itself.
5. To cook slice the sausage into half-inch rounds and grill in a hot skillet with no water for about 12 minutes on each side or until brown and crisp at the edges.,

instructions, 1. In a large bowl mix yeast warm water and 1 cup of bread flour into a thin batter and let stand until the mixture shows frothy bubbles about 10 minutes. Stir in vegetable oil honey 3 eggs and salt until well combined. Beat in 2 more cups of bread flour and the whole wheat flour alternating flours by cupfuls until the dough is too stiff to stir in more flour.
2. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic about 10 minutes adding more flour if needed to form a slightly sticky dough. Form the dough into a round shape. Lightly oil a bowl place the dough in the bowl and turn the dough over a few times to oil the surface. Cover the bowl with a plastic bag and let rise in a warm draft-free place until doubled 1 to 2 hours.
3. Punch down the dough knead it a few times to remove some of the bubbles and cut it into 3 equal-sized pieces. Cut the first piece into 3 equal parts. Set the rest of the dough aside under a cloth to prevent drying out while you braid the first loaf.
4. Working on a floured surface roll the small dough pieces into ropes about the thickness of your thumb and about 12 inches long. Ropes should be fatter in the middle and thinner at the ends. Pinch 3 ropes together at the top and braid them. Starting with the strand to the right move it to the left over the middle strand (that strand becomes the new middle strand.) Take the strand farthest to the left and move it over the new middle strand. Continue braiding alternating sides each time until the loaf is braided and pinch the ends together and fold them underneath for a neat look. Repeat for the other 2 loaves place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and let rise until doubled 45 minutes to 1 hour.

instructions, 1. Place sugar salt and oil in either a mixing bowl for an electric mixer with a dough hook or any large bowl.  Add hot water and stir to dissolve the sugar and salt. Stir in yeast and let stand until mixture gets foamy.  Add slightly beaten eggs.
2. If using an electric mixer add  4 1/2 cups of flour to the yeast mixture.  Mix until flour is mixed in and dough gets stringy. This stringiness indicates that the gluten has developed.  Continue to add flour until dough is all on dough hook; 1 or 2 cups is usually sufficient.  Let hook continue to knead for several minutes.  Dough should be smooth and elastic.  To knead by hand stir 4 1/2 cups of flour in to the yeast mixture. Turn soft dough onto lightly floured surface and work in 1 to 2 cups of flour. Knead until smooth and elastic about 8 to 10 minutes.
3. Place dough into a greased bowl and turn several times to coat the surface.  Cover bowl with a damp cloth.  Let dough rise until doubled in bulk.  Punch down after first rising and allow to rise a second time. The first rising is about 1 hour the second about 45 minutes.  Two risings makes for a better bread but if time is a problem just do one.
4. Divide dough in half and divide each half into three or four equal parts.  Make two braids and place both breads on a greased baking sheet.  Cover and allow to rise until doubled.  Brush with beaten egg.  Sprinkle with poppy seeds if desired.

Ropes should be fatter in the middle and thinner at the ends. Pinch 3 ropes together at the top and braid them. Starting with the strand to the right move it to the left over the middle strand (that strand becomes the new middle strand.) Take the strand farthest to the left and move it over the new middle strand. Continue braiding alternating sides each time until the loaf is braided and pinch the ends together and fold them underneath for a neat look.
4. Place the braided loaf on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush the top with beaten egg yolk. (For a softer crust brush with melted butter instead.)

If it is very humid where you live it may help to refrigerate dough 15 minutes or so and you can also refrigerate the portion of the dough that you're not presently working with.

instructions, 1. In a non-reactive saucepan combine the cider vinegar salt brown sugar black pepper cayenne pepper and butter. Bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. Mix in the water and return to boil. Sauce the pork before smoking and then every hour or so while it cooks.
2. Start the pork butt on a slow smoker using hardwood coals or charcoal briquettes and mesquite or apple wood chips. Smoke the pork for at least 6 hours and up to 10. The longer the smoke time the deeper the 'smoke ring' a red ring of flavor will penetrate.
3. After the meat has smoked for 6 to 10 hours use aluminum foil to wrap the meat. Fold the edges of two sheets together to form a watertight seal. Place the meat in the center and bring the edges up to the top cupping the meat. Pour 1 cup of the sauce over the meat and then seal the foil tightly around the roast.
4. Place the meat package back on the smoker or in a 350 degree oven (175 degrees C). If it is on the smoker increase the heat. Cook the package until the meat pulls easily from the bone. This can be checked easily by pushing on the top of the foil package with an oven-mitted hand to test for softness. It will take up to 2 hours.
5. Once the meat is done remove it from the smoker or oven and let it cool. Pull the pork from the bone and discard the fat and gristle. Pull the meat apart in large chunks about 1 inch wide by 4 inches long.
6. Place the meat chunks in a pan and pour about one cup of sauce for every 4 pounds of meat or to taste. Heat until simmering. Serve immediately or let marinate for several days. The meat can also be pulled into smaller pieces using 2 forks this is locally known as 'shredded pork'.,

source, https://allrecipes.com/recipe/245452/tex-mex-eggs-benedict-with-grilled-potato-slabs-and-avocado-lime-hollandaise/, 
instructions, 1. Place hollandaise ingredients (avocado lime juice 3 tablespoons olive oil water) in your blender and turn on until smooth. Scrape the sides as needed. Add salt to taste. The sauce should be thick and creamy but if needed add a bit more lime juice oil and/or water to get it moving more. Refrigerate until ready to use.
2. Preheat your grill to 375 degrees F. Slice the potatoes lengthwise into 1/3-inch-thick slabs. Drizzle with 2 teaspoons olive oil and rub over both sides. Generously top with salt and pepper. Place on the grill for about 12-15 minutes. Flip and continue to grill until fork tender about 15 minutes. If your potatoes finish before you're done cooking the vegetables turn the heat off on the grill with the lid shut and leave them there to stay warm until you're ready.
3. My egg poaching method: While the potatoes grill place about 4 inches of water in a large pot. Heat over high with the lid on until the water simmers. Uncover and reduce heat so the water is just barely simmering a few small bubbles. Maintain this heat throughout the poaching process. Place 2 paper towels on a large plate. Crack 1 egg in a small bowl. Gently swirl your water with a spatula in one direction and slowly pour the egg into the center of the pot. Gently swirl the water a few times around the egg then let it be for 4 minutes. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on the paper towels; repeat for each egg using the same water.
4. Heat a pan over medium with a drizzle of oil. Place the onion in the pan with a good pinch of salt and let it cook stirring every minute or so for about 8 minutes. Add the garlic cumin and chili powder and cook for another minute. Return the pot of water to just below a simmer. Add the bell pepper to the pan and cook for another 3-4 minutes stirring once in a while until just starting to soften. Add the corn and black beans and cook until hot. Stir in the adobo sauce and turn to low.
5. Place all eggs gently back in the warm water and let them reheat for no longer than 1 minute. Place potato slabs on 2 plates with the veggie mixture over top. Remove eggs with a slotted spoon or place on the paper towel to drain the water and then place them on top of the veggie mixture (2 for each serving). Top with the avocado hollandaise salt pepper and hot sauce if desired. Serve immediately.,

2. During the week add more sugar as the sugar in the jar dissolves. Gently tip the jar back and forth to mix. Continue the process throughout the week until you have used up all of the sugar. When all of the sugar has been absorbed pickles will be dark green and crispy. Transfer pickles to smaller sterile jars and divide syrup between jars. Seal with lids and rings.

instructions, 1. Combine the warm water 1/2 teaspoon of sugar and the yeast in a measuring cup. Let stand until the yeast dissolves and starts to foam 5 to 10 minutes.
2. In a large bowl beat 2 eggs. Put the egg yolks in a measuring cup and add enough milk to equal 1/3 cup with the yolks in it. Pour this in with the eggs and then stir in the yeast mixture butter salt and remaining sugar. Gradually mix in the flour until the dough is firm enough to handle. Knead the dough on a floured surface until the dough does not stick to your hands. You will probably use more flour while kneading. Place the dough into an oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover and let rise until doubled in size about 1 hour.
3. Cut the dough into 3 or 4 even portions and roll into long ropes. Braid and tuck the ends under. Place the loaf on a baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Set in a warm place to rise. Bread is ready to bake when your finger leaves an impression in the dough.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk the remaining egg in a cup with a fork. Brush onto the loaf. This will give the bread a lovely golden color and delicious crust.
5. Bake until the loaf is golden and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom about 35 minutes. Remove from the baking sheet and cool on a wire rack.,

instructions, 1. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of sugar in warm water. Sprinkle yeast over the top and let stand for about 5 minutes to dissolve.
2. In a large bowl beat the eggs and 1 cup of sugar until sugar has completely dissolved. Stir in the salt and flour. Mix in the yeast mixture milk and melted butter. A wooden spoon works well for this. Cover and set in a warm place to rise until doubled.
3. Once the dough has doubled punch down and knead a bit - a lot if you want. The dough should be elastic. Cover and allow to rise again. If you like you may refrigerate overnight. My grandmother would let it rise overnight and hers were amazing. When the dough has doubled it is ready to use.
4. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Set a small dish of water to the side for wetting your hands slightly before touching the dough. This will help it keep from sticking. Only wet your hands a little excess water dripping in the hot oil is very dangerous.
5. With slightly wet hands gather a small ball of dough about the size of a golf ball. Stretch the dough out a little bit while turning around until you have a disc about 4 inches wide. If you mess up just throw it back in with the other dough and start over. Tiny holes are fine.
6. Carefully place the stretched dough into the hot oil. The doughnuts should puff up a bit as they hit the oil. Cook for about 3 minutes per side. They are done when they are golden brown. Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Coat with white sugar while still hot. Serve warm.,
