source, https://allrecipes.com/recipe/157011/quince-paste/, 
instructions, 1. Wash peel and core the quinces reserving the cores and peels. Coarsely chop the flesh and transfer the fruit to a large pan. Wrap the cores and peels in cheesecloth tie the bag with kitchen string and add it to the pan. (The peels contain most of the fruit's pectin which contributes to the firmness of the quince paste.)
2. Pour in enough water to cover the quinces and boil half-covered for 30 to 40 minutes or until the fruit is very soft. Remove the bag of peels and pass the quince flesh through a sieve or food mill. (For best results don't use a food processor as it will result in too fine a texture.) You should have about 2 1/2 pounds of fruit pulp.
3. Transfer the quince pulp to a saucepan and add the sugar (ideally you should add the same amount of sugar by weight as the fruit pulp). Cook and stir over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Continue cooking for about 1 1/2 hours stirring frequently with a wooden spoon until the paste becomes very thick and has a deep orange color. Draw the wooden spoon along the bottom of the saucepan: it should leave a trail and the quince mixture will stick to the spoon.
4. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish or line it with greased parchment paper. Transfer the quince paste to the baking dish spreading it about 1 1/2-inch thick. Smooth the top and allow it to cool.
5. Dry the paste on your lowest oven setting no more than 125 degrees F (52 degrees C) for about 1 1/2 hours. Allow the quince paste to cool completely before slicing. (In Europe the traditional method of drying the quince paste is to leave it in a cupboard for about 7 days. The remaining juices will continue to evaporate and render a drier paste.)
6. Store quince paste in an airtight container in the refrigerator; the color will deepen with age.,

2. Beat 4 of the eggs with milk.   Add 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice and vanilla.
3. Make a well with dry ingredients and add lemon mixture.  Mix in Sambucca and the one egg.

5. Make a glaze with confectioners' sugar and flavor with the almond extract (or any other flavoring you like). Add enough milk to the confectioners' sugar to make a loose frosting.  Try to frost the cookies when cool.  Just dip tops into frosting and twist. Sprinkle colored candies if you like them while the cookies are still wet with frosting.
6. You can also use this recipe to make filled cookies.  For filled cookies you need to roll the dough into 12 x 4 inch oblong shapes and fill with filling.  To Make Filling:  Poach prunes with a little water.  Remove from heat and add raisins chopped walnuts  chopped candied cherries and 2 eggs.  Mix well.  Add a few drops of any flavoring you like I like lemon.
7. After the dough is stretched place the filling in the middle  lengthwise and roll  dough.   Place on cookie sheet with seam on the bottom.
8. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)  until the crust is golden (about 20-30 min.)  When cool you can frost the logs and let the frosting dry then slice on the bias.  (My husband loves the ends of the logs.)    ENJOY!!,

instructions, 1. Line an 8x11-inch baking dish with plastic wrap allowing ends to hang over the sides. Place 1 sheet of 8x10 wafer paper in the bottom of the pan. Keep the roasted almonds and pistachios in a warm place until ready to add at the end. This makes it easier to mix them in.
2. Pour honey into a heavy-bottomed pot. Add sugar. Mix and stir over low heat with a spatula stirring constantly until mixture turns from grainy to silky and smooth about 30 minutes. Remove pot from heat.
3. Place the egg whites in a mixing bowl; add a pinch of salt. Whisk until whites form soft peaks 3 to 4 minutes. Place pot back on low heat. Gradually whisk about a quarter of the whipped egg whites into the honey/sugar mixture; whisk in the remaining egg whites in 3 more batches.
4. Continue cooking over low heat stirring constantly with a spatula until mixture turns a brighter white and a ribbon of the mixture does not immediately incorporate back into the rest of the mixture and stays intact on the surface for a while. This will take about 40 minutes. You can add a few drops of the mixture into a small bowl of ice cold water to test the consistency; ideally it should feel like soft clay.
5. Whisk in vanilla and lemon zest. Add warm almonds and pistachios and stir to incorporate evenly.
6. Transfer mixture to prepared baking dish. Even out as best you can with a clean oiled spatula. Top with 2nd sheet of wafer paper shiny side up. Cover with plastic wrap and press down evenly tamping mixture down gently but firmly. Remove top layer of plastic.
7. Allow torrone to sit at room temperature until cool firm and ready to cut 1 or 2 hours. Lift torrone from baking dish with the edges of the bottom layer of plastic wrap. Invert and remove plastic from the bottom. If the plastic wrap is difficult to remove from the edges of the torrone you can trim off the edges.

instructions, 1. In a saucepan combine the sugar corn syrup and water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat stirring just enough to dissolve the sugar. Heat to between 223 and 234 degrees F (106 to 112 degrees C) or until a small amount of syrup dripped from a spoon forms a soft thread. It should take 1 or 2 minutes.
2. When the sugar mixture has reached the thread stage remove it from the heat and set aside. Whip the egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer. When the whites can hold a stiff peak pour in the sugar syrup in a thin stream while continuing to whip at medium speed. Be careful not to pour too quickly or it will all end up at the bottom of the bowl. When the syrup is incorporated continue to mix for 10 more minutes to allow it to cool. The egg whites will be fluffy and glossy.
3. Add pieces of cold butter one at a time to the egg whites and continue to whip at medium or low speed. Then do the same with the shortening. The buttercream will break down and look curdled but keep mixing and it will come back together in about 10 minutes. When it comes back around mix in the vanilla. Store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
4. To use after it has been refrigerated allow it to come to room temperature then beat with a mixer before using. If cold heat over a double boiler until you have liquid visible just around the edges. Beat with a mixer until smooth and fluffy before using.,

instructions, 1. On the evening before you intend to make the dish prepare the eggplant. Cut the ends off the eggplants and peel. Cut the peeled eggplant into long strips about as big around as shoestring french fries. Place the strips into a large bowl and stir in 1/2 cup of coarse salt.
2. Place a sturdy dinner plate upside down in a clean sink making sure that the drain is not blocked. Place a generous handful of the eggplant strips onto the center of the plate and cover with another upside down dinner plate to create an eggplant sandwich. Layer more eggplant and plates until all of the eggplant is sandwiched. Cap it off with one additional plate and press down firmly. Set a sturdy stock pot on top and fill with enough water to create some pressure on the eggplant layers. Not so much pressure that you break your dishes though. Let this pressing process stand overnight.
3. The next day fill a large bowl with ice water. Begin dismantling your stack of plates. One layer (handful) at a time briefly swish the eggplant around in the ice water then squeeze dry and place into a clean bowl. If your hand starts to hurt you are swishing too long. Once all of the eggplant is rinsed and squeezed and in the bowl mix in the vinegar. Let rest for about 15 minutes.
4. Heat a splash of the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot add the garlic red pepper flakes oregano and sea salt. Cook and stir just until fragrant. You do not want to cook the garlic. Set aside to cool.
5. Your eggplants should be well rested now. Give them one last sqeeze. Make it a good one or your melenzana is going to taste like pickles. ''Don't worry this is the last time I promise...'' (This is to be said to the poor little melenzana - they've been through so much!)
6. Place the squeezed eggplants into a large bowl and stir in the contents of the skillet and remaining olive oil until well blended. Transfer to sterile 1 pint or 1/2 pint jars. Make sure to fill the jars to the top and top off with any olive oil that may be left in the bowl. Wipe the rims with a clean dry cloth and seal tightly with new lids. Refrigerate for at least a month before opening.,

Pipe the batter back and forth just between the lines in a compressed S motion until you run out of batter. This is the part that wraps around the outside of the cake. (It helps to have it in one piece but you can pipe individual fingers using the guidelines drawn on the paper if you prefer.)  There may be extra.

instructions, 1. Place flour into work bowl of a large stand mixer; add both amounts of water 1 tablespoon olive oil and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Mix dough using stand mixer fitted with dough hook on low speed until it forms a ball on the dough hook 5 to 6 minutes. Dough should be soft and elastic but not sticky.
2. Turn dough out onto a work surface and form a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand on counter at room temperature for 1 hour.
3. Lightly grease the quarter-sheet baking pan with 1 teaspoon olive oil; sprinkle with cornmeal. Dust a work surface lightly with flour.
4. Move oven rack to center position. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
5. Unwrap dough and cut into quarters. Pat each quarter out on the floured work surface to a roughly rectangular shape. Roll 1 piece of dough out to about 3/8 inch thick retaining rough rectangle shape until dough is about 6x8 inches. Pick up dough with well-floured hands and gently stretch it rotating as you go until dough is almost large enough to fit over the prepared sheet pan. Pull and stretch dough so it overlaps the edge of the pan by about 1/2 inch and fasten dough edges to sheet pan edges; dough will be thin and membrane-like.
6. Drop about 6 tablespoons of crescenza-stracchino cheese onto the stretched dough spreading the dollops out evenly. Roll out another piece of dough as before stretching to fit over the first dough sheet and cheese. Stretch pull and seal dough as before so the cheese is enclosed between the 2 sheets of dough.
7. Roll a rolling pin over the edges of the dough to simultaneously seal the flatbread edges and cut the overlapping edges off. Roll the overlapping dough edges away from the pan so flatbread falls into the prepared pan. Press flatbread edges flat and roll slightly if desired to be sure the edges are fully sealed. Discard rolled-off dough edges.
8. Pinch a small bit of the top dough between your thumb and forefinger and gently tear a small hole in the dough; repeat 2 or 3 more times to make a few tears in the top layer.
9. Drizzle flatbread lightly with 2 teaspoons olive oil; sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon coarse sea salt.

Cover dough with plastic wrap when not working with it. Run each piece through a pasta machine on its widest setting a dozen or so times folding in half and rotating the sheet 45 degrees each time (see Cook's Note). Dust with flour very sparingly only if needed to prevent tearing. Repeat with all four pieces. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.
3. Blend ricotta cheese in a food processor until smooth. Boil 1 cup of water and stir in the sugar. Sift in the semolina whisking to avoid clumping. It will immediately thicken up. Reduce heat to low fold in the ricotta and cook for another 2 minutes stirring constantly.
4. Remove pan from heat and return filling to food processor. While processor is running add egg yolks one at a time until fully combined. Add vanilla cinnamon and candied orange peel and pulse to mix. Transfer filling to a bowl. Cool to room temperature cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
5. Divide each dough piece into four pieces. Cover dough with plastic wrap. Place clean kitchen towels over a work surface. Lay each sheet of dough on the towels while you roll out the remaining sheets.
6. Run each piece through the pasta machine on progressively smaller settings until dough is as thin as possible. After running it through the pasta machine stretch each sheet as wide as you can without tearing. Dough sheets should stretch to three times their original width and be so thin you can see through it.
7. Place a sheet of parchment paper on a work surface. Melt butter and lard. Place the first sheet of pastry on the parchment. Brush the dough with the butter-lard mixture. Lay the second sheet above the first overlapping a half-inch or so. Roll the sheets up into a tight cylinder leaving about an inch to overlap the next sheet. Lay the third dough sheet on the parchment overlapping the second sheet and brush with the butter mixture. Continue rolling up the log of dough repeating until all the dough pieces are brushed with the butter mixture and rolled up. Wrap dough log in the parchment sheet and wrap entirely with plastic wrap; refrigerate for 2 hours.
8. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place filling mixture in a pastry bag or a 1 gallon zipper bag with the corner snipped off.
9. Cut cylinder of dough into half-inch slices; you should have 16 to 20 pieces. Holding the dough in both hands use your thumbs to flatten the dough piece from the center outwards. Form flattened slice into a cone shape. Pipe filling into center close partially and repeat with remaining dough and filling.
10. Bake in preheated oven until dough turns golden brown and starts to "peel" back from the pastries 20 to 30 minutes. You can baste the pastries a couple of times with the leftover butter and lard mixture during baking if you like. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.,

2. To Make Filling:  Cut up figs orange and apple into small pieces.  (It is easier to grind this way).  Grind figs raisins orange and apple.  If the mixture is too dry or thick mix in up to 1 cup of water if desired.  (I do not use the water the juice from the apple and orange are enough).  The spices and chopped nuts are added to the ground fig mixture.  After the fig mixture is ground I sprinkle them in over the mixture and mix (knead) it in by hand.  STICKY!  But good.
3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Roll out some dough. (should be kind of thin).  Put fig mixture in a line.  Wrap dough over mixture sealing figs inside dough.  Trim to desired length using a diagonal cut.  Make small diagonal slits in the sides of the cookies.  Bake on ungreased cookie sheet for 10-15 minutes.  (Dough makes good cookies without the filling also).  Wonderful  with coffee.,

instructions, 1. Place pork roast on a work surface. Use a sharp knife to make a lengthwise cut about 1 inch from the edge of the meat slicing down but not cutting through.

When the meat is unrolled make small slashes through any connective tissue or extra-thick parts so the roast is as even in thickness as possible.
2. Drizzle cut surface with 2 teaspoons olive oil. Rub oil into meat and generously season with 2 teaspoons kosher salt black pepper sage rosemary orange zest garlic and crushed fennel seeds.

instructions, 1. First make the fondant. It needs to be refrigerated overnight before using. To make the fondant you'll need a marble slab or a baking sheet and an offset spatula to fold the candy. If you're using a baking sheet rinse it with water leaving a few drops on the pan.
2. Dissolve the cream of tarter in the water in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the sugar and bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Swirl the pan occasionally to help dissolve the sugar. Do not stir once the sugar syrup begins to boil. Heat to 240 degrees F (115 degrees C) or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.
3. Immediately pour the candy onto the baking sheet or marble slab and let cool for 10 minutes. Use a spatula to vigorously knead the candy folding it over itself. Knead until it begins to look cloudy 5 to 10 minutes; allow it to cool. Transfer the fondant to a heatproof bowl or the top of a double boiler. Refrigerate overnight.
4. To make the sponge dissolve the yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in 1/4 cup of the room-temperature milk. Pour the remaining 1/2 cup milk into the bowl of a stand mixer. Add 1 cup of flour and the yeast mixture. Mix with a fork to combine. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow to rest until bubbly 10 to 15 minutes.
5. Stir the remaining 3 cups of flour 1/4 cup sugar salt room-temperature eggs and zest from 1 lemon into the sponge. Use the dough hook to mix the dough on the lowest setting. Mix the dough for about 5 minutes occasionally scraping the dough off of the hook and down the sides of the bowl.
6. Increase the speed to medium-low and add the softened butter 1 tablespoon at a time until fully incorporated. Allow the dough to mix for an additional  5 minutes scraping the dough down as needed. Add the ground almonds and turn the mixer on for 1 or 2 turns mixing just until incorporated. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and shape it into a ball. Place the ball in an oiled mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel and let it rise until doubled 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
7. While the dough is rising prepare the filling. Heat the milk in a heavy 4-quart saucepan until it begins to boil; stir in the butter and sugar. Remove the pan from the heat and add the poppyseeds 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon zest and the cinnamon. Let the mixture stand for 30 minutes to soften the poppyseeds. When the mixture is cool whisk in the egg.
8. Punch down the dough and roll it out into a 10 1/2- by 16-inch rectangle. Spread the filling evenly over the dough leaving a 1-inch margin on all sides. Roll the dough up into a log starting with the long side and pinch the edges together to form a seam. Place the loaf seam-side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover it with greased plastic wrap or a well-floured kitchen towel and allow it to rise for an additional 30 to 40 minutes.
9. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
10. Bake the stollen until golden brown on the bottom of the loaf about 40 minutes. Let the bread cool completely before glazing.
11. To glaze the bread add the lemon juice to the fondant. Place the bowl  over a pan of  simmering water stirring frequently with a rubber spatula until soft and glossy. Pour the fondant over the stollen and allow it to cool before slicing.,

3. To make the sauerkraut and cabbage filling pour the drained sauerkraut into a large saucepan. In a medium skillet saute 2 onions in 1/2 cup butter until tender about 5 minutes. Stir the onions into the sauerkraut along with the cabbage and chicken bouillon cube. Cook over low heat until liquid evaporates. Season with pepper and remove from heat. Allow the mixture to cool then run through a grinder or food processor.
4. Remove the dough from the bowl onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out to 1/8 inch in thickness. Cut into 3 inch circles. Place one tablespoon of filling onto one side of the circle. Fold the other half over and press the edges to seal. Place finished dumplings onto a floured tray and keep covered.
5. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Drop 10 or so dumplings into the water at a time. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes then remove to a colander to drain. Place finished dumplings onto a lightly oiled dish and turn them to coat with a thin layer. This will keep them from sticking together.  Serve dumplings with fried onions and sour cream. Cooled dumplings also can be fried in oil and butter for a nice crispy surface.,

instructions, 1. Remove outer leaves and any undesirable portions from firm mature heads of cabbage; wash and drain. Cut into halves or quarters; remove core. Use a shredder or sharp knife to cut cabbage into thin shreds about the thickness of a dime.
2. In a large bowl thoroughly mix 3 tablespoons salt with 5 lbs. shredded cabbage. Let salted cabbage stand for several minutes to wilt slightly; this allows packing without excessive breaking or bruising of the shreds.
3. Pack salted cabbage firmly and evenly into a large clean pickling container. Using a wooden spoon tapper or hands press down firmly until the juice comes to the surface.
4. Repeat shredding salting and packing of cabbage until the container is filled to within 3 to 4 inches of the top. If juice does not cover cabbage add brine: 1 1/2 tablespoons salt to 1 quart water; bring brine to a boil; cool.
5. Cover cabbage with muslin or cheesecloth  and tuck edges down against  the inside of the container. Weight down  cabbage under brine. Formation of gas bubbles indicates fermentation is taking place. Remove and discard scum formation each day. A room temperature of 70 degrees to 75 degrees F is best for fermenting cabbage. Fermentation is usually complete in 3 to 6 weeks.

time, Cooking Time - 210 minutes Preparation Time - 20 minutes, 
source, https://allrecipes.com/recipe/157011/quince-paste/, 
instructions, 1. Wash peel and core the quinces reserving the cores and peels. Coarsely chop the flesh and transfer the fruit to a large pan. Wrap the cores and peels in cheesecloth tie the bag with kitchen string and add it to the pan. (The peels contain most of the fruit's pectin which contributes to the firmness of the quince paste.)
2. Pour in enough water to cover the quinces and boil half-covered for 30 to 40 minutes or until the fruit is very soft. Remove the bag of peels and pass the quince flesh through a sieve or food mill. (For best results don't use a food processor as it will result in too fine a texture.) You should have about 2 1/2 pounds of fruit pulp.
3. Transfer the quince pulp to a saucepan and add the sugar (ideally you should add the same amount of sugar by weight as the fruit pulp). Cook and stir over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Continue cooking for about 1 1/2 hours stirring frequently with a wooden spoon until the paste becomes very thick and has a deep orange color. Draw the wooden spoon along the bottom of the saucepan: it should leave a trail and the quince mixture will stick to the spoon.
4. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish or line it with greased parchment paper. Transfer the quince paste to the baking dish spreading it about 1 1/2-inch thick. Smooth the top and allow it to cool.
5. Dry the paste on your lowest oven setting no more than 125 degrees F (52 degrees C) for about 1 1/2 hours. Allow the quince paste to cool completely before slicing. (In Europe the traditional method of drying the quince paste is to leave it in a cupboard for about 7 days. The remaining juices will continue to evaporate and render a drier paste.)
6. Store quince paste in an airtight container in the refrigerator; the color will deepen with age.,

Cook over medium heat stirring frequently until thickened about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the butter. Refrigerate until cool then stir in the mayonnaise.
3. Peel the potatoes if desired and cut into medium dice. Place in a large bowl and toss with the onion celery carrots celery seed and hard-cooked eggs. Gently fold in the dressing.

source, https://allrecipes.com/recipe/102126/irish-chocolate-stout/, 
instructions, 1. Pour 3 gallons of water into a large stainless steel pot. Heat to 130 degrees F (55 degrees C). This works best using an outdoor propane burner from a turkey fryer but you can also use your stove. Add 1 teaspoon gypsum English malt chocolate malt roasted barley and black patent malt in a nylon steeping bag. Steep for 30 minutes maintaining the temperature.
2. After 30 minutes increase the heat to 152 degrees F (65 degrees C). Steep for 60 minutes maintaining a constant temperature. Remove grains to a separate pot to drain and bring the wort to a boil. Rinse the grains with water of the same temperature and pour the liquid into the pot. Stir in the dry malt extract and 1 teaspoon of gypsum. Return to a boil and add the Fuggles hops; set a timer for 60 minutes. When there are 15 minutes left add the Irish moss. When 10 minutes are left add the Willamette hops.
3. About the same time as you add the Irish moss and final hops prepare an ice bath by filling a sink large tub or cooler with ice. When the time is up remove the pot from the heat cover and place in the ice bath. Be careful not to drop anything into the pot that is not sterilized including spoons. Cool your wort to 68 degrees F (20 degrees C). You can swirl around the ice bath to help it cool.
4. Meanwhile dissolve the yeast in 1 cup of water (70 degrees F) and let it stand until ready to use. This will help to keep from shocking your yeast and ensure a faster start of the fermentation.
5. Strain the wort into a sterile fermenter (carboy) and add the yeast. Add enough bottled or boiled and cooled water to reach the 5  1/2 gallon mark about 1 1/2 more gallons. Seal with a cap and shake or rotate to mix in the yeast. Replace the cap on the fermenter with an airlock and place in a cool dry place where the temperature remains consistently below 70 degrees F (21 degrees C). Ferment for 7 days or until it stops foaming.
6. Use a sterile siphon hose to transfer the beer to a secondary fermenter. Set in a place where the temperature is 64 degrees F (17 degrees C). Cap with the airlock and ferment for 14 days or until the specific gravity has dropped to 1.005 when tested using a hydrometer or does not change for several days.
7. Sterilize your bottles for bottling. Pour the beer into a new sterile 5 gallon bucket and stir in the corn sugar until dissolved. Siphon into sterile bottles and cap. Let the beer prime in the bottle for at least 14 days in a place where the temperature stays below 70 degrees F (21 degrees C).,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
2. In a large roasting pan combine the onion celery carrot pepper and garlic. Stir in the beef broth onion soup mix and water so that the soup mix is dissolved. Season the roast with salt and coarse ground pepper and place into the roasting pan.
3. Place the uncovered roasting pan into the preheated oven. After 1 hour of roasting begin basting every 30 minutes. Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature and bake until the internal temperature of the roast reaches 130 to 140 degrees F (55 to 60 degrees C) for medium rare or 145 to 155 degrees F (63 to 68 degrees C)  for medium well. When the temperature has reached 110 degrees F (43 degrees C) you will need to begin checking more often.
4. When the roast is done remove the meat to a platter and set aside. Place the roasting pan full of stuff onto the stove top. Cook over medium heat mashing the vegetables against the side of the pan with a large spoon. Simmer to reduce the sauce to about half. This may take 20 or 30 minutes depending on the size of pan. Strain the juice over the meat and let it begin to cool in the juices. When the meat has cooled wrap and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight. Reserve juices in a separate container.
5. When the roast is cold unwrap it and slice against the grain as thinly as possible. An electric meat slicer works best but a sharp knife or electric carving knife will also work well. Skim the fat from reserved juices and heat the meat in the juice over low heat. Adjust seasonings to taste before serving.,

Stir in half of the remaining bread flour until no dry spots remain. Stir in the remaining bread flour a 1/2 cup at a time mixing well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl then place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume about 2 hours.

Once both sides are braided pinch the edges together to form a ring. Place the ring on the prepared baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Allow ring to rise until tripled in volume about 1 1/2 hours.
5. Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Arrange the oven rack to the lowest position. Beat 1 egg and 1 pinch of salt together in a bowl. Brush the braided ring with the egg mixture. Sprinkle with additional poppy seeds if desired.

instructions, 1. Place apples and 2 cups of cider vinegar or water into a large pot.  Cook over medium low heat until soft.
2. Put the fruit through a strainer.
3. Measure the apple pulp by cup into a large mixing bowl. Keep track of how many cups of apple pulp you have added to the mixing bowl. For each one cup of apple pulp mix in 2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice and the zest of one lemon; mix well.
4. Spoon the mixture into a Dutch oven. Cook the mixture over a medium or medium-low temperature until it "sheets" from the spoon.  What this means is that you put a small amount of the apple butter in a spoon and let it cool slightly.  As it thickens two large drops will form along the edge of the spoon (as you hold the spoon upside down over the pot) one drop on either side of the spoon.  When these two drops come together and fall as one drop of the spoon the sheeting stage has been reached.
5. Pour apple butter into hot sterilized jars. Process for 10 minutes in a boiling water bath.,
