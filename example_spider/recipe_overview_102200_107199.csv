instructions, 1. Put some oil or Lea& Perrins in a big pot  I prefer Lea and Perrins as it adds flavor and isnt as fattening as oil.
2. Brown your meat hard and fast to seal in as much flavor as possible and give it loads of color.
3. This is where I add as much Oxo (made according to the packet) to keep the meat covered.
4. You could use beef stock instead  you can end up using a lot of Oxo!
5. Bring to the boil and then simmer over a low heat for as long as you can.
6. The last time I made it was simmering for 4-5 hours.
7. Just keep topping up with your stock.
8. I like to add pepper and worcester sauce or hp sauce just to give it a bite.
9. Add your onion about 1 hour before you plan to stop cooking it  any less and its a little too crunchy  any more and its just boiled onion.
10. When just about done simmering  add cornstarch or other thickening agent  youre aiming for really thick brown gravy.
11. Place in a pie dish and leave to cool.
12. Roll out your puff pastry in a floured surface  big enough to cover your pie with overlap on the edges  If youre making a big pie two packs is best.
13. Bake in the oven at 200°c/400°f for about 20-30 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and puffy.,

4. Add some freshly ground black pepper to the bacon and mix well - we like it quite peppery please adjust the quantities to suit your personal taste.
5. When the sprouts are cooked drain and place in a serving bowl.
6. Pour over the lemon butter/oil from the pan. Add the crisp bacon lemon zest and a twist of sea salt. Toss well to infuse all the flavours and serve immediately.
7. NB: You can gently re-heat the lemon butter/oil before pouring over the sprouts if it has cooled down too much.,

instructions, 1. Note - you will need 4 crumpet rings or egg rings or 7.5cm (3in) plain pastry cutters greased.
2. Place the flour and salt into a large bowl and stir in the sugar and yeast making a well in the centre. Pour in the warm milk and water and mix to give quite a thick batter. Beat well until completely combined and cover with a tea towel or cling film.
3. Leave in a warm place to rise for about an hour until it's a light spongy texture. Stir well to knock out any air add the bicarbonate of soda and pour into a large jug - mix well and allow to stand for a further 30 minutes.
4. Heat a non-stick frying pan or a greased griddle over a very low heat with a drop of oil or butter. Wipe the pan with kitchen paper to remove excess oil/butter. Sit the greased crumpet rings in the pan and leave to heat up for a couple of minutes.
5. Pour in enough mixture to fill the rings just over halfway up the sides. Leave to cook until lots of small holes appear on the surface and the batter has just dried out. This will take about 8-10 minutes.
6. Remove the rings and turn over the crumpets to cook for a further minute or two on the other side. Sit the first batch of crumpets on a wire rack whilst continuing to cook the remaining crumpets.
7. Serve the crumpets warm generously buttered. If you are making crumpets in advance then reheat them by toasting lightly on both sides before serving. (Prep time includes rising time for the yeast dough.).,

instructions, 1. Heat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Dice strawberries and set aside.
3. In a bowl mix the flour sugar baking powder and salt.
4. Add butter and blend until it is crumbly.This can be done in a food processor to speed things up.
5. Stir in strawberries and toss.
6. Add milk or cream.
7. Mix until it holds together.
8. Divide dough in half.
9. On floured surface roll into 2 circles 1/2 inch thick.
10. Cut as for pie into 6 slices each.
11. Place on greased cookie sheet.
12. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown.
13. While scones are baking whip the heavy cream sugar and vanilla in a cold bowl until stiff.
14. Notes: I make the dough in the morning and cut it put it on a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper and freeze it.  When I am ready for a cuppa and a scone I take however many I want out and bake adding about 3 or 4 minutes to my baking time. I put the rest of the dough in a freezer bag and return it to the freezer. That way you can always have fresh scones in a jiffy. I also brush them with cream and sprinkle with sugar before baking.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350f/180c/gas mark 4.
2. Sift flour and salt into a large bowl and add the butter and lard cut into cubes.
3. Work the butter and lard into the pastry until you have a fine breadcrumb consistancy. Add enough cold water to be able to work the mixture into a ball - make sure you add a little dribble at a time you don't want it too wet! Once you have a ball put the  bowl into the fridge.
4. Peel the apples cut into thick slices and put in a pan. Cover with 2 tablespoons of cold water and cook until the apple slices are softened but still retain their shape.
5. Remove apples from heat and strain liquid off. Sprinkle with the sugar and leave to cool.
6. Whilst the apples cool grease a pie tin and flour a surface. Divide the dough in half and roll to a large enough size to do a top and bottom crust for your pie tin. This is very short pastry (it will cook very soft and buttery!) so try not to over-roll or you'll find it breaking up.
7. Line the pie tin with one of your pastry circles and spoon half of the cooled apple slices inches Even out and layer the cheese slices on top. Then arrange the last half of your apple slices on top of the cheese.
8. Dampen the edges of the bottom crust with water and lay the top crust on top. Press round the edges to seal with the ball of your thumb or the back of a fork. Brush the top of the pie with milk and sprinkle with sugar. Then cut a couple of small vents in the middle to allow steam to escape.
9. Place in the middle of the oven and cook for approx 35 minutes or until golden brown. If it's browning too quickly for you either move the pie down a shelf or turn the oven down a little.
10. This is best served hot and goes beautifully with double (heavy) cream vanilla or cinnamon icecream.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 190° C or 375°F.
2. Have ready between 12 -18 paper cases depending on size. Small pie or cake tins will take standard paper cases. These cakes SHOULD be small and dainty and NOT standard "muffin" size. (However you can make them bigger and adjust the cooking time by 5 minutes.).
3. Cream butter or margarine with sugar until light fluffy and pale in colour. By hand is best but a hand whisk is fine too!
4. Beat the eggs and add them bit by bit with spoons of sifted flour. Bit by bit ensures the mixture does not curdle.
5. Gently fold in an any flour left over when the egg is used up.
6. Add the vanilla or any other flavourings desired - lemon and orange is good too! If the mixture is a little too stiff add a little milk or juice of orange/lemon.
7. Half fill the paper cases with the mixture and bake for about 15 minutes until risen and firm but NOT too dark.
8. Cool cakes and then cut a slice from the top of each cake and cut this in half.
9. Place a little butter icing of your choice on the top of each cake and arrange the "wings" around the icing - round edge facing the outside and the cut edge to the inside and angled towards the bottom - like BUTTERFLY or FAIRY wings! Dust with extra icing sugar and watch them fly away!
10. If you want to add colouring to the vanilla cakes pink is really good with pink icing too! I once sprinkled on crystallised rose petals for a Christening Party & I also used rose essence in the butter icing very sophisticated!
11. N.B. You can multiply this recipe very easily e.g: 6 ozs of butter flour & sugar to 3 eggs; 8 ozs of butter flour and sugar to 4 eggs & so on! It also makes VERY good big Victoria Sponge cakes - just slice and fill with a filling of your choice -- lemon curd butter icing fresh whipped cream & jam -- the list is endless!,

cuisine, European >> UK >> English, 
time, ,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 220°C.
2. Stuffing:
3. Melt the butter in a saucepan. When the foaming subsides add the chopped onion. Saute on a gentle heat for around 10 minutes. Cook until translucent avoid browning.
4. Take pan off heat and add all remaining ingredients.
5. Mix well with your hands to incorporate the egg. If the mixture seems a little too dry add a touch of water. If too moist add some more breadcrumbs. It should hold its shape easily.
6. Duck:
7. Cut neck off duckling and put aside for future use in gravy (below).
8. Put the stuffing inside the cavity of the duck. Close up the flaps of the cavity securing them with toothpicks.
9. Cover the duck with melted butter and season generously with salt and pepper.
10. Place the duck breast-side down (to make all the juices run into the breast making for a more succulent final result) on a rack. Then place rack & duck in a roasting tray.
11. Add a little water to the bottom of the roasting tray to prevent burning.
12. Place tray in oven. Cook at 220°C for 15 minutes.
13. After the 15 minutes reduce the heat to 180C and cook for a further 30 minutes.
14. After the 30 minutes turn duck breast-side up and continue cooking for another 60-70 minutes (still on 180°C) checking on occasion that it does not burn/is not browning too much.
15. Note: While duck is cooking make your gravy and apple sauce.
16. If duck is getting too brown/dark reduce heat to 160°C or cover the extremities of the duck with aluminum foil.
17. At the end of the cooking time remove duck from oven. Place in a warm spot (perhaps atop an unused part of the stove) and cover with aluminum foil until serving time.
18. Gravy:
19. Chop neck from (above) duckling into pieces with a meat cleaver.
20. Put the pieces of neck and oil in a saucepan over the heat and allow some of the duck fat to render.
21. Add roughly chopped vegetables herbs bay leaf peppercorns and salt and fry for 20 minutes on medium heat stirring regularly.
22. After the vegetables and duck neck have achieved a good brown color add enough water (or stock) to barely cover the contents of pot.
23. Bring slowly to the boil skimming any scum (bubbly impurities that gather at the surface) that appears.
24. When gravy has come to the boil reduce to a gentle simmer and continue to skim scum from  time to time. Keep on gentle simmer for as long as possible for the best flavor adding a touch more water or stock from time to time if needed.
25. When the duck (above) gets close to being cooked strain the gravy through a fine sieve to remove the vegetables herbs etc. Push down hard using the back of a spoon so as to extract as much juice as possible. Discard vegetables (or feed to your chickens/compost heap!).
26. In a clean pan bring the strained gravy to the boil stirring occasionally.
27. When gravy has reduced by a third thicken with cornflour dissolved first in a small amount of cold water (3-4 tablespoons). Make sure to quickly stir gravy once cornflour is added to ensure good dispersion of cornflour & smooth gravy consistency.
28. Season the gravy with salt and pepper according to your personal tastes.
29. You could also add some of the pan juices from the roast duck once it has finished cooking - just stir in well.
30. Apple Sauce:
31. In spaces where duck and gravy are cooking & able to be left alone for a bit prepare apple sauce.
32. Peel and core the apples. Roughly chop them.
33. Place apples in saucepan with all other ingredients (except lemon juice).
34. Bring to the boil then reduce to a simmer cooking until the apples collapse (should take around 30 minutes). Stir frequently to prevent burning/sticking.
35. When cooking has finished take off heat and add lemon juice. Stir.
36. Serving:
37. Place gravy in a sauce boat.
38. Place apple sauce in a bowl/boat.
39. Carve the duck.
40. Enjoy!

instructions, 1. Finely chop the bacon; thoroughly wash and dry then trim and finely slice the leeks; beat the egg; cut the mushrooms into quarters; cut the tomatoes in half; and finely shred the cabbage.
2. Place the serving plates in a low oven so that they will be warmed when required.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil (less if the bacon is fatty; see notes below) in a heavy-based non-stick pan add the bacon pieces fry for about 4 minutes until crisp then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper kitchen towelling.
4. (Optional departure: If you want to add finely chopped onion and/or garlic add them 1-2 minutes BEFORE adding the leeks to the pan.).
5. Add the leeks to the pan and sauté for 2 minutes.
6. Transfer the bacon and leeks (and onions & garlic) to a large bowl add the mashed potatoes cabbage and egg (see notes below) season to taste and mixing together with wet hands shape into 4 round cakes 10cm/4" across. (If you've been imprecise or overly generous in the quantity of some of the ingredients you may well have enough for five or six cakes.  You may also choose to make smaller cakes but remember to then adjust the cooking time: they'll cook much faster of course.).
7. Heat the remaining oil in the pan add the bubble and squeak cakes and cook for about 6 minutes on each side or until golden brown.  Remove the cakes from the pan and keep warm.
8. Add the mushrooms and tomatoes to the pan and sauté for 4 minutes. (I add basil here probably about 1 tablespoon of fresh basil)
9. Place the bubble and squeak cakes on warm serving plates top with the mushroom and tomatoes and serve immediately.
10. Chef's notes: I always buy middle rashers and remove ALL the fat so I do need a little oil probably about 1/2 tablespoon.  If you use streaky bacon I can't see that you'd need much oil at all if any certainly not the full tablespoon specified in the recipe.  Because I've usually been imprecise in my measurements of one or other or several of the vegetables I usually add 2 eggs.  If tomatoes are just not looking very good or you cannot find a flavoursome variety (isn't the tasteless tomato the bane of all our lives?) canned drained tomatoes are fine.,

instructions, 1. Stock:
2. You can just buy some stock from the supermarket if you want but this way is more satisfying and it makes the kitchen nay the whole house smell gorgeous!
3. Chuck the bones on a roasting tray and place in an oven at gas 6 for one hour. Roughly chop the veg bash the garlic and add the bay leaves and rosemary to a large casserole dish or pan.
4. When the bones have roasted for an hour drain off the fat and add the bones to the casserole dish. Cover with water and place on the heat and bring to a simmer. Cover and leave for at least one hour. Leave for longer for a better flavour. I recommend at least two hours three if you can.
5. Remove the bones and sieve the stock into a large jug. For extra flavour let the softened veg fall into the sieve and go at them with a potato masher so squeeze out all the juices and flavour.
6. Put the stock in the fridge or freezer to cool so the fat in the stock forms a solid crust on the surface. Much easier to remove it this way than skimming it when still in little globules floating on the surface.
7. Hot Pot:
8. Take a bowl and add about 250g of plain flour. Doesn’t matter how much really as it’s just to coat the meat. Season it well with salt and fresh ground black pepper. Coat the lamb in the flour mixture and brown quickly in a very hot pan. Does this in batches. Adding load of meat to a pan will just reduce the heat and you’ll and up with a mess in the pan. This isn’t just about sealing the meat. You want to get a nice golden colour on it for look and flavour.
9. Peel and slice the onions (Don’t dice or finely chop) and sweat in butter on a low heat for around 20/30 minutes until they start to darken in colour. Set to one side.
10. Peel and slice the spuds. You’re looking for something between ½ and 1 cm slices.
11. Assemble in a large casserole dish in layers. Meat / Onions / Potato and repeat until the dish is full. If using chops you want about four per layer depending on how many you’re feeding. Go the extra mile and arrange the last layer of potato in overlapping concentric circles. It’s worth.
12. it for the look of the thing when you bring it to the table to serve.
13. When done peel the layer of now solid fat from the stock and pour a couple of pints over the hot pot put the lid on and cook in a low oven (gas 3 or 4) for at least 3 hours. For a better flavour cook for longer but check that you’re not evaporating all the stock. You should have.
14. additional stock to top up if you find it getting low (Check using a skewer).
15. Finally just before serving melt some butter in a saucepan and brush over the top layer of spuds. Place under a hot grill or back in the oven on a high heat to get a really nice golden colour. Sprinkle with some of the chopped parsley and serve in large bowls with fresh crusty.

instructions, 1. *Used a combination of Granny Smiths (for their tart flavor and crisp texture) and Cortlands (for their sweetness and softer texture). If you use all Granny Smiths or all Cortlands (or other kinds of apples) adjust the amount of sugar to your taste.
2. CRUST:
3. In a medium-size mixing bowl whisk together the flour and salt. Using an electric mixer a pastry blender or fork or your fingers cut and mix the cheese and butter into the flour mixture until the fat and flour form a crumbly mixture. Add the lemon juice or vinegar then sprinkle on just enough water so that you can gather the dough into a cohesive ball.
4. Divide the dough in half and flatten each half into a 1-inch thick round. Wrap one of the rounds in plastic wrap or waxed paper and refrigerate it while you work with the other. Transfer the remaining dough to a well-floured work surface. Roll it into a 12-inch circle using as few strokes of the rolling pin as possible; the fewer times you touch the crust at this point the more tender it'll be when it's baked. Transfer the circle of dough to a 9-inch pie plate (a giant spatula works great here) and gently fit it to the pan's contours. Again if you push and stretch the dough too much during this stage it'll shrink when you put it in the oven.
5. FILLING:
6. Peel core and slice the apples. In a large shallow frying pan cook the apples with the salt cinnamon cider or juice and sugar for 15 minutes or until the apples are tender and the liquid is syrupy. Add the cooked sausage.
7. Spray the crust with some nonstick vegetable oil spray (this helps it stay crisp) then spoon the filling into the crust. Roll out the remaining crust and center it over the filling. Press the edges of the top and bottom crust together fold them under (onto the top of the pan's rim) and crimp.
8. BAKE:
9. The pie in a preheated 425°F oven for 15 minutes then lower the heat to 375°F and bake for an additional 35 to 45 minutes till the crust is very brown. Remove the pie from the oven and serve it warm or at room temperature.,

instructions, 1. Might as well do the boring stuff first.  Grease and line an 8-inch (~20cm) square cake tin.
2. Half wash and flour the cherries.
3. Sift the flour salt browning and spices together into one bowl.
4. Cream the sugar and butter together until the mixture is light and fluffy.
5. Add an egg and about quarter of the flour mixture and beat until just mixed. Repeat until you have no more eggs or flour left.
6. Stir in the fruit and cherries.  You may make a wish at this point if you want - although you can't tell anyone what it is if you want it to come true!  It often helps if there's someone big and strong in the house in time to do the final stir as the mixture is very thick and heavy.
7. Put the mixture in the prepared cake tin making sure that a large hollow is left in the centre to make up for the cake rising when it's cooked.
8. Cook on gas mark 1 (140°C 280°F) for 4 1/2 hours (yes you did read that right although check that it's cooked by sticking a knife in it from about 4 hrs onwards)  If the cake is cooked the knife will come out clean.
9. Leave the cake to cool before taking it out of the tin or trying to remove the stuck bits of greaseproof paper.  A large corner of my 21st birthday cake (made to the same recipe) was held together with wooden toothpicks because it'd been taken out of the tin too soon!
10. When cold wrap in greaseproof paper and place in an airtight tin.
11. A month to 6 weeks before Christmas start dosing the cake with alcohol by making holes with a skewer and dribbling teaspoons of alcohol into the holes.  Repeat at least once a week and make sure you dose both sides of the cake over the month.  It is up to you how much alcohol you wan to feed your cake.  Re-wrap the cake after dosing.
12. About a week to 10 days before Christmas marzipan the cake (using apricot jam as the glue) and leave it out (covered by a clean teatowel) for a few days to dry out.
13. About 3 or 4 days before Christmas Ice the cake and leave out until the icing is completely solid.,

instructions, 1. To make the filling warm the cranberries and icing sugar together in a saucepan until the fruits begin to soften. Increase the heat so the juices boil and become jammy. Pour the mixture into a bowl then stir in the cranberry sauce or jelly. Leave to cool. Butter and lightly flour a large sheet of greaseproof (about 40 x 30cm) and sit it on a bigger sheet of foil. Put a steamer on to simmer.
2. For the dough mix together the flour suet caster sugar and orange zest with a wooden spoon. Stir in some milk until the mixture reaches the consistency of a soft pastry. Gather together into a ball but don't overwork or it will toughen.
3. On a lightly floured surface roll the dough into a rectangle about 22cm x 25cm. Spread with the cooled cranberry mix leaving a 2cm border around the edge. Moisten the border with cold water or milk before rolling into a cylinder. Start by tucking over the border of one of the short ends then lift as you roll (see step 1 click photo above) so the jam doesn't get squeezed out. With the long join underneath lay the roly-poly in the centre of the parchment paper. Fold over the long paper and foil edges to seal leaving enough space above the pudding to allow it to rise. Squeeze the paper ends together tightly to seal them.
4. Lay the parcel in the steamer over the simmering water cover and steam for 1¼-1½ hrs until firm to the touch. Rest for a min or two before unwrapping slicing and serving. Vanilla custard is the perfect accompaniment and the roly-poly is best eaten as soon as it is made.
5. Using a bamboo steamer:
6. Steam the Roly-poly in a large bamboo steamer over a pan of boiling water or use a large tiered steamer. Make sure the pan doesn't boil dry while the pudding is steaming - so keep checking the water level. If it is getting low top up with more boiling water.,

Whisk the paste into the simmering milk and allow it to boil for 3-4 mins whisking gently all the time to prevent it from scorching. You should now have a very thick white sauce. Cool the sauce in a bowl. Fry the mushrooms in the oil for 3-5 mins until golden then leave to cool.
2. Place the ham cheese and mushrooms into a bowl then gradually add the white sauce until everything is well coated. Finally add the herbs.
3. Roll out the pastry on a floured surface to about the thickness of a £1 coin (1/16 inch) and cut out 4 saucer-size rounds re-rolling the trimmings if you need to. Brush the edges of each round with beaten egg. Spoon the mixture onto 1 side of each round then fold over and seal the edges well. The turnovers can now be frozen for up to 1 month. Brush the turnover with the remaining egg then chill for 30 minutes.

cuisine, European >> UK >> English, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.
2. Lightly oil an oven proof dish with the teaspoon of olive oil - using a pastry brush is best.
3. Place one chicken breast between a large piece of cling film and gently beat it  with a cook's mallet - beating until large and fairly thin - try NOT make any holes in the chicken! Repeat with the second chicken breast.
4. Place the chicken breasts on a work board and spread half the Boursin cheese on each chicken piece - make sure it is spread evenly right up to the edges.
5. Roll the chicken breasts up - tucking the last small "fillet" flap up and into the stuffed roll.
6. Wrap the bacon pieces or pancetta ham around the stuffed chicken making sure they do not overlap too much and the edges are sealed underneath.
7. Gently lift them into the oiled oven dish.
8. Season well with freshly ground black pepper. (Season with salt to taste - the bacon will make it quite salty so watch out when seasoning with salt.).
9. If using the lemon juice pour over the top of the chicken breasts now.
10. Scatter or arrange the cherry tomatoes around the chicken pieces. (I like to keep them on the vine.).
11. Place in the middle of a pre-heated oven and roast for between 45 - 55 minutes; the cooking time depends on the size of the chicken breasts and your oven.
12. Remove from the oven and place the chicken breasts on a plate - you can serve them whole or sliced. Garnish with watercress as well as the roasted cherry tomatoes.
13. Serve with a selection of seasonal fresh vegetables and a jacket potato making sure you spoon the excess Boursin sauce over the top of the chicken pieces and the roasted cherry tomatoes!
14. Tip:You can make an optional creamy sauce. On taking the chicken out of the oven add the creme fraiche and white wine to the Boursin cooking juices in the oven dish whisk together and then gently heat whisking all the time over medium heat on top of the stove or decant the creme fraiche wine and juices to a small saucepan and heat the sauce in the pan. (Make sure to keep the chicken warm whilst you do this.).
15. TO FREEZE:
16. As soon as you have stuffed and wrapped the bacon around the beaten chicken breasts wrap individually in cling film and put into a freezer container or a freezer bag. Take them out as required and allow to defrost for 4-5 hours at room temperature or overnight in the fridge.
17. Cook as above.
18. Can be frozen for up to 3 months with no adverse effects on the Boursin cheese.,

2. Assemble meat grinder and prepare the casings: Choose long pieces of the casings so that you have more control over the size of the links that you wish to make.
3. Soak the casings in cool water about 5 minutes (more soaking will make the casings very tender and prone to bursting) about an hour in advance of stuffing to remove the salt on the outer surface.
4. Rinse under cool running water.
5. To remove excess salt from the inside hold one end of a casing in place on a faucet nozzle and turn on cold tap water to fill the casing with liquid.

instructions, 1. Cut dice and slice your assorted tomatoes - making sure that there are plenty of different shapes sizes and colours of tomatoes available. I like to leave small cherry tomatoes whole and then slice large tomatoes whilst dicing and cubing medium and round tomatoes - try to make the salad look "textured"!
2. Place the sliced and diced tomatoes into a large colander. Sprinkle over some sea salt - not too much about 1/4 teaspoon then shake the tomatoes gently and sprinkle over some more sea salt. Do this one more time and allow them to sit for 15 to 30 minutes in a sink or over a bowl.
3. Transfer the tomatoes to a large attractive serving bowl or platter and sprinkle over your choice of chopped fresh or dried herbs see above in the ingredients list.
4. Make the dressing using one part vinegar to three parts olive oil then add the minced garlic and some freshly ground black pepper - taste and adjust the seasoning; salt should not be needed as the tomatoes will have some residual salt left - but add salt to the dressing if you feel it is needed.
5. Drizzle the dressing over the tomatoes and chopped herbs and then decorate the salad with whole herb leaves and flowers serve immediately.
6. If you are transporting this salad to a picnic decant the dressing into a bottle and only dress the salad just before serving and eating it.
7. Serve with assorted crusty and artisanal breads and rolls – for ease of “juice mopping”!,

instructions, 1. Peel the onion carrot and garlic and cut the onion and carrot into rough chunks.  Put them all along with the roughly cut up stick of celery into the bowl of a food processor.  Blitz till all are finely chopped.
2. Spoon the oil into a heavy-based wide saucepan and put on medium heat.  When warm add the chopped vegetables from the processor and cook for 5-10 minutes until soft but not colored.
3. Add the ground mace-give a good stir and then add the split peas and stir again until their are glossily mixed with the oil-slicked cooked-down vegetables.  Pour over 5 cups stock and add the bay leaves then bring to a boil.  Cover turn down the heat and cook for about an hour until everything is tender and sludgy adding more stock as needed.  Sometimes the peas seem to thicken too much before they actually cook and need to be watered down. Taste for seasoning once everything's ready.
4. You can add the frankfurters as you wish.  It's probably easiest just to cut them into slices - I tend to add them in chunks of about and inch each - and throw them into the soup warm but I just put them in the microwave (40 seconds on high is about right for one or two franks) then slice them hot and add them to each person's bowl as they come.  Not an elegant soup I'll admit but a near-perfect one.,

instructions, 1. Prepare a 9 by 12 baking pan.  I cut a piece of parchement paper to fit the bottom.
2. In a heavy medium sized saucepan - put in 1 cup sugar and the butter.  Melt over low-medium heat.  Add water. Stir frequently. Using a candy thermometer cook to 300 degrees F.  This should take approximately 15-20 minutes.
3. When the mixture has reached 300 degrees pour into prepared pan.  This will - of course- be very hot!  Put the pan on a heatproof surface.  If the mixture does not spread out evenly use a heat-proof spatula to spread out the mixture to an even layer.  It does not have to be perfect and the thick pieces will taste just fine!  When you are finished spreading the mixture sprinkle the chocolate chips evenly over the top of the HOT mixture.  These chips will melt very quickly then smooth them over the top of the toffee mixture with a spatula (don't mix!)  As soon as the chocolate has set (cooled slightly) sprinkle lightly with the pecans.  Tap the pan against the counter to "set" the nuts.  Let cool.  Break into pieces.,

2. Drizzle the olive oil over the mushrooms and asparagus and gently toss to coat them.
3. Put the mushrooms in the center of the pan; arrange the asparagus on both sides of the mushrooms with tips pointing in both directions on both sides of the mushrooms; reserve the tomatoes at this point.
4. Bake the mushrooms and asparagus in the oven for about 15-20 minutes.

6. Sprinkle a touch of sea salt over top of tomatoes and asparagus and bake for approximately another 10 minutes. Make sure to check your asparagus and mushrooms to desired tenderness.
7. For the sauce:
8. Pour the milk into a medium sized saucepan.
9. Make an ‘ornament’ with the onion bay leaf and clove by using the clove to pierce the bay leaf and then poke the bay leaf into the onion; add your ‘ornament’ to the milk in the saucepan.
10. Warm the milk gently over low heat to infuse the flavors until it just begins to boil; cover and let rest for about 15 minutes or so while you follow the next step.
11. In another medium saucepan melt the butter over low heat; mix in the flour and cook for a couple of minutes stirring constantly.
12. Add the milk to the butter/flour mixture 1/2 cup at a time; cook and stir until all the milk has been added.
13. For a stronger flavor in your sauce you can add the onion from the milk mixture at this point.
14. Cook over low heat until thick about 20-25 minutes; stirring occasionally so it doesn’t burn on the bottom.
15. Once the sauce has thickened remove the onion and add salt and pepper to taste; leaving the sauce over very low heat.
16. Stir in the cream (if using) to give a silky texture to the sauce. You don’t have to use it all depending on the thickness of your sauce; keeping in mind the cheese will also thicken the sauce further.
17. Add the mustard and cheese to the sauce until the cheese is melted; BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO LET BOIL!. The cheese will separate and it will not look appealing.
18. Drizzle the Cheese Sauce over top of the baked vegetables and serve.,

6. Turn the heat down and simmer at a low heat stirring occasionally for at least 1 hour.\ (You can't really overcook a stew.)
7. Add the vegetables (green beans carrots and potatoes) and bring it all back to a boil- you can add as many vegetables as you like just use water to cover them if they stick out of the liquid in the pot. The more potatoes you add the better the stew will be on it's own.
8. Simmer on a low heat for at least another hour (remember you can't overcook a stew) stirring occasionally.
9. If after an hour you find that your stew is too juicy you can take the lid off and try to steam away some of the liquid or for a quick fix add a little cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it up (the directions for how to do this should be on the pack.)
10. Serve with rice or as is if you have added a lot of potatoes.,

instructions, 1. In a 5 or 6 quart bowl or lidded food storage container dump in the water and add the yeast salt and malt powder. Because we are mixing in the flour so quickly it doesn’t matter that the salt and yeast are thrown in together. If you are using the fresh cake yeast break it up.
2. Dump in the flour along with the wheat flakes all at once and stir with a long handled wooden spoon or a Danish dough whisk which is one of the tools that makes the job so much easier!
3. Stir it until all of the wheat is incorporated into the dough. It will be a wet rough dough.
4. Put the lid on the container but do not snap it shut. You want the gases from the yeast to escape. (You could put a little hole in the top of the lids so that you could close the lids and still allow the gases to get out.). Allow the dough to sit at room temperature for about 2 hours to rise. When you first mix the dough it will not occupy much of the container. But after the initial 2 hour rise it will pretty much fill it. (If you have decreased the yeast you will have to let it go longer than 2 hours.) DO NOT PUNCH DOWN THE DOUGH! Just let it settle by itself.
5. The dough will be flat on the top and some of the bubbles may even appear to be popping. (If you intend to refrigerate the dough after this stage it can be placed in the refrigerator even if the dough is not perfectly flat. The yeast will continue to work even in the refrigerator.) The dough can be used right after the initial 2 hour rise but it is much easier to handle when it is chilled. It is intended for refrigeration and use over the next week and a half ready for you anytime. The flavor will deepen over that time developing sourdough characteristics.
6. The next day when you pull the dough out of the refrigerator you will notice that it has collapsed and this is totally normal for this type of dough. It will never rise up again in the container.
7. Dust the surface of the dough with a little flour just enough to prevent it from sticking to your hands when you reach in to pull a piece out.
8. You should notice that the dough has a lot of stretch once it has rested. (If your dough breaks off instead of stretching your dough is probably too dry and you can just add a few tablespoons of water and let it sit again until the dough absorbs the additional water.).
9. At this point you can divide the dough into 4 one pound balls and freeze them in airtight containers for up to three weeks. Allow 24 hours in refrigerator to thaw before use. You can also leave the dough in its container in the refrigerator for up to 10 days cutting off pieces as needed.
10. When ready to bake cut off a 1-pound piece of dough using kitchen shears and hold in your hands. Add a little more flour so it will not stick to your hands. Gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides rotating the ball a quarter turn as you go. Most of the dusting flour will fall off; it's not intended to be incorporated into the dough. The correctly shaped final product will be smooth and cohesive.
11. Rest the loaf on a generous layer of corn meal on top of a pizza peel. Let the dough rest for at least 40 minutes (although letting it go 60 or even 90 minutes will give you a more open hole structure in the interior of the loaf. This may also improve the look of your loaf and prevent it from splitting on the bottom. ) You will notice that the loaf does not rise much during this rest in fact it may just spread sideways this is normal for this type of dough.
12. Twenty minutes before baking preheat the oven to 400 degrees F with a baking stone on the center rack with a metal broiler tray on the bottom (never use a glass vessel for this or it will shatter) which will be used to produce steam. (The tray needs to be at least 4 or 5 inches away from your stone to prevent it from cracking.).
13. Dust the top of the loaf with more flour so the knife will not stick. Cut the loaf with a cross or a tic-tac-toe pattern using a serrated knife. If your slashes are too shallow you will end up with an oddly shaped loaf and also prevent it from splitting on the bottom.
14. Slide the loaf into the oven onto the preheated stone and add a cup of hot water to the broiler tray. Quickly close the oven door. Bake the bread for 35 minutes or until a deep brown color. To insure that you get the best results it is crucial to have an Oven Thermometer to make sure your oven is accurate.
15. Allow the loaf to cool on a rack until it is room temperature. If you cut into a loaf before it is cooled you will have a tough crust and a gummy interior. It is hard to wait but you will be happy you did! Make sure you have a nice sharp Bread Knife that will not crush the bread as you cut. Or you can tear it apart as they do in most of Europe.
16. If you have any leftover bread just let it sit uncovered on the cutting board or counter with the cut side down. If you cover a bread that has a crust it will get soggy.,

cuisine, European >> UK >> English, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Rinse bird thoroughly on outside as well as inside the body and neck cavities.
2. For the turkey place the water into your largest cooking pot or bucket/plastic bin and add all the turkey ingredients stirring to dissolve the salt sugar syrup and honey. (Squeeze the juice of the orange quarters into the brine before you chuck the pieces in.).
3. Untie and remove any string or trussing attached to the turkey shake it free and add it to the liquid. Add more water if the turkey is not completely submerged. Keep the mixture in a cold place even outside overnight or for up to a day or two before you cook it remembering to take it out of its liquid (and wiping it dry with kitchen-towel) a good 40 or 50 minutes before it has to go into the oven. Turkeys - indeed this is the case for all meat - should be at room temperature before being put in the preheated oven. If you're at all concerned - the cold water in the brine will really chill this bird - then just cook the turkey for longer than its actual weight requires.
4. Lightly spoon stuffing into neck and body cavities. Pull neck skin to back and fasten with a skewer. If a band of skin crosses tail tuck drumsticks under band. If there is no band tie drumsticks to tail using 100-percent-cotton kitchen string. Twist wing tips under the back.
5. Spoon half the basting glaze under the skin and massage it into as much of the bird as possible.
6. Place the other half into a saucepan and cook over a low heat while stirring until the ingredients have melted and combined.
7. Preheat the oven to 220°C
8. Roasting time is dependent on size of bird: Whole stuffed turkey - For 3.5 - 5kg turkey roast for 3 to 3 3/4 hours. For 5 - 6.5kg turkey roast for 3 1/4 to 4 1/2 hours. For 6.5 - 8kg turkey roast for 4 to 5 hours. For 8 - 9kg turkey roast for 4 1/2 to 5 1/4 hours. Always check doneness with thermometer (as instructed below) half an hour before recommended time is complete (to prevent overcooking and a dry bird.
9. Place bird breast side up on a rack in a shallow roasting pan; drizzle and brush top side with basting glaze. Turn over and brush bottom side with basting glaze. Keep your breast meat moist by roasting your turkey upside-down breast down. This keeps all the juices from escaping.
10. Cover with foil leaving air space between bird and foil. Lightly press the foil to the ends of drumsticks and neck to enclose bird.
11. Place oven rack in lowest position.
12. Baste every half an hour throughout the turkey roasting time.
13. Cook the turkey for half an hour at 220°C.
14. Turn the oven down to 180C and continue cooking.
15. Two-thirds through roasting time cut band of skin or string between drumsticks.
16. The last 45 minutes of roasting turn the turkey breast side up and uncover. This is a little messy - use towels to turn - but the breast meat ends up moist and juicy.
17. Turn the oven back to 220C for the last 15mins or so to give a final browning boost to the skin.
18. Insert an oven-going meat thermometer into centre of one of the inside thigh muscles. The thermometer should not touch bone. Continue roasting until meat thermometer registers 85C (check temperature of thigh in several places). Centre of stuffing should register 75°C.
19. You can also check by piercing the flesh between leg and body with a small sharp knife: when the juices run clear the turkey's cooked.
20. Remove bird from oven; cover with foil. Just as it's crucial to let the turkey come to room temperature before it goes in to the oven so it's important to let it stand out of the oven for 15-20 minutes before you actually carve it.,

instructions, 1. Grease 3 oven or cookie trays.
2. Preheat oven to 180C (350F).
3. Combine sifted flour coconut and sugar in a large mixing bowl.
4. Mix well.
5. Make a well in the flour mixture and stir in melted butter and milk.
6. Mix well.
7. (Don't worry if the batter looks a bit crumbly.) Using your hands shape rather than roll level tablespoons of the mixture into balls.
8. (Don't worry if the balls aren't perfectly round).
9. If the mixture seems too crumbly at this stage add a tablespoon or two of milk to the batter but be careful not to make it too wet- it should still look crumbly and the dough should just come together with the heat of your hands.
10. Place balls about 7cm (3") apart on oven trays.
11. (They will flatten out as they cook.) Now holding the balls together with the fingers of one hand gently push the handle of a wooden spoon into the centre of each biscuit to make an indentation about 5mm (1/4") deep.
12. (If the biscuits split a little just gently push the dough back together.) Using a finger to ease the jam off the spoon drop about 1/4 teaspoon of jam into the hollow of each biscuit.
13. (Be neat and don't overfill- you can add more jam later.) Bake on the centre shelf/shelves of a moderate 180C/350F oven for about 15 minutes or until lightly browned.
14. Cook in batches if necessary.
15. Remove plum drops from oven and leave on trays while you add an extra 1/4 teaspoon of jam into each hollow.
16. When plum drops are firm to touch remove gently to cool on wire racks.
17. Store in an airtight container between layers of baking (silicone) paper.
18. They will keep well for up to a week- if they last that long!,

instructions, 1. Wash hull and slice your strawberries and set aside.
2. Using a serrated knife cut the pound cake into 1/2 inch slices and then each slice into thirds. Set aside.
3. Pour all the cream in a large bowl and add the juice of 1/2 a lime.  Whip either manually or with a mixer until stiff peaks form.
4. Using a spatula about a cup at a time slowly fold in the mango pulp until fully incorporated (the cream will soften but retain body).
5. Now here's hoping you have a large deep glass dish of some sort!  Begin with a layer of poundcake layer tightly but now so tightly that they're smashed.  If you're using alcohol pour about 1/3 to 1/2 a cup of the alcohol over the cake and allow to soak inches
6. Then put a layer of strawberries on the cake.  Next place the sliced strawberries around the perimeter of the cake and against the glass with the narrow end up.
7. Now spoon a generous amount of the Mango Fool over the strawberries.  Then a layer of cake alcohol strawberries Fool and so on until you reach the top of your dish.
8. At this point I like to decorate with some mint leaves or strawberries on top.

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 190C / 375F / Gas mark 5. Grease a baking sheet or line with baking paper (not greaseproof).
2. To make the filling: put all ingredients except the kidney beans into a food processor and process until very finely chopped. Turn into a bowl and stir in the kidney beans. Add plenty of pepper to taste.
3. To make the pastry: Grate 120g margarine (or 60g margarine and 60g white fat) into 225g flour and the salt. Stir and cut through well with a large blunt knife to break up the fat and margarine a little.
4. Using the blunt knife to stir gradually add enough water to make a soft dough. Do not make too sticky. Using a little of the remaining flour gently roll out the pastry until about 1cm thick. Fold the pastry into thirds by bringing the bottom edge up to about two thirds and the top edge down to cover. Then fold the sides in the same way. If not using straight away wrap in foil and store in the fridge for up to 24 hours.
5. To form the pasties: Roll out the pastry to about 1cm thick and cut into 4 rounds about the size of a large tea plate. Pile filling into the centre of each circle and top with a piece of the remaining margarine. For each pasty dampen the edge of the pastry with a little water then fold pastry over the filling to form and half circle. Try to stuff as much filling in as you possibly can.
6. To make the traditional edging beginning at the right side use the forefinger and thumb of your right hand to pinch the pastry together while using the forefinger and thumb of your left hand to fold over the section of pastry next to it. Move along to the next section of pastry and repeat. Continue in this way along the edge of the pastry making a rope-like join.
7. Place the pasties onto the prepared baking sheet. Brush each one with soy milk and prick with a fork to let the steam escape.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes until golden brown. Serve piping hot. The pasties should not split open but if they do it’s not a problem they are merely called ‘laughing pasties’!,

instructions, 1. Get the stock bubbling in a saucepan on a medium-heat hob. Skim excess fat from the turkey roasting tin leaving about 3 tablespoons of liquid fat with the dark turkey juices in the tin. Place the roasting tin on the hob over a low heat and sprinkle with flour.
2. Whisk the flour into the juices to form a smooth paste. Begin to add the hot stock a little at a time whisking briskly to blend. As the stock is added and it hits simmering point the gravy will thicken. If it is too thin let it cook to reduce if it's too thick add some more liquid.
3. Add a splash of wine and continue to reduce. The gravy should cook for 15-20 minutes. Season with freshly milled pepper and some salt then pour into a warmed gravy jug to serve with your roast turkey.,

instructions, 1. make a poolish  Put 480g flour and 480g springwater and one tablespoon of sourdough starter yeast put in a plastic bowl cover with cling film and place in airing cupboard or other warm area until the mixture is well fermented(very frothy)could  take several hours. Transfer frothy mix into a a cold stainless steel bowl to retard the yeast action and place in fridge until late Thursday evening  Remove from fridge put mix into a large plastic bowl cover and leave safe until friday morning.
2. Final Dough Friday  Add spring water/malt instant yeast to poolish then  665g flour(no salt)Mix then rest for twenty minutes. Pour out onto work surface. Now for the french kneading(throw and slap method) you will need a plastic dough scraper to help work the mix for at least 10 minutes when the dough begins to come together and you see the gluten developing. You can rest the dough for twenty minutes and have a rest yourself Now  add your salt and continue kneading for another ten to fifteen minutes.  Put dough into two large bowls to make 2 baguetes each 250g and 1 large 350g   place in airing cupboard for two hours. Tip dough onto work surface divide and shape into baguettes  proof for one hour in metal baguette tins(to assist slashing I sprinkle rice flour over top which will give you the  desired surface for slicing I use a razor blade) in warm area I use hot water bottles.  Cook four small baguettes 26 minutes ( first 5 at 250) remainder 190 turn once Place on wire racks to cool. The larger two I would suggest a total of thirty to thirty five minutes. Good baking.,

instructions, 1. Heat a large pan and cook the onion and lardons together for 5 mins until golden. Scoop out with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the oil to the pan dust the beef with the flour then evenly brown over a high heat.
2. Add the parsnips ale stock jelly thyme and lardon mixture to the pan. Bring to the boil then cover and simmer for 1½ hrs until the meat is tender.
3. Generously butter a 1.5-litre pudding basin. To make the pastry mix together the flour mustard powder suet and ½ tsp table salt. Add enough cold water about 150ml to make a soft dough. Remove one-quarter of the dough and set to one side. On a heavily floured surface roll out the remaining dough to make a large round big enough to line the basin.
4. Carefully lay the pastry in the basin (aim to have 1cm of pastry overhanging the rim) then press the edges of the join together to seal. Roll out the remaining one-quarter into a circle big enough to cover the top.
5. Pour off the cooking liquid from the filling into a small pan and set aside. Discard the thyme stalks. Spoon the filling into the lined basin and pour over 100ml of the cooking liquid. Fold over the overhanging pastry and brush with water. Place the lid on top pressing firmly around the edges to seal.
6. Butter a sheet of baking parchment fold in a large pleat and lay butter-side down on top of the pudding. Cover with a pleated layer of foil and finally tie with string making a loop for the handle so you can lift the pudding easily.
7. Sit a small trivet or a large cookie cutter in the bottom of a deep saucepan that's big enough to take the basin easily. Half-fill the pan with water and bring to the boil. Lower in the pudding cover and simmer for 2 hrs topping up with boiling water when necessary.
8. Reheat the cooking liquid bubbling it down a little so it reduces into a tasty gravy. Carefully lift out the pudding. Run a knife around the rim then turn out and serve with gravy and greens if you like.,

instructions, 1. Preheat your oven to 240C475F or gas mark 9. (If you are cooking roast beef and/or roast potatoes make sure the beef has been removed to "rest" before carving and that the potatoes are moved down to the bottom shelf and NEED browning still.).
2. Pour a scant amount of oil or dripping into your Yorkshire Pudding tins.(A large roasting tin can be used too. If you do not have a Yorkshire Pudding tin which has 4 wide and shallow cups of about 4" in diameter then use a large muffin tin.).
3. Put the tin into the pre-heated oven about 5 minutes before you want to cook the Yorkshire Puddings.
4. Empty the flour salt & pepper into a large roomy bowl.
5. Make a dip in the centre and add the beaten eggs bit by bit mixing as you go along.
6. Add the water/milk mixture gradually and whisk in between each addition.
7. Keep whisking until all the liquids have been added. The batter may still be lumpy - this does not matter.
8. Cover and leave to rest for up to 1 hour.
9. Just before cooking whisk thoroughly again to break down any lumps & add some more air.
10. Carefully take out the tin/s. Pour the batter into the tin/s and QUICKLY return to the oven.
11. Cook for about 20 minutes until well risen and golden brown. DO NOT open the oven in the first 10-15 minutes or they will DROP!
12. If you have two tins cooking rotate the tins from top to bottom shelves after the 10-15 minutes so they cook evenly.
13. Serve with Roast Beef and lashings of gravy!
14. Can also be served with any Roast Dinner - we love them with Roast Chicken - see photos!,

2. In a separate bowl cream together the butter and sugar until completely combined; Add Egg Beaters to the creamed butter/sugar beating well; Add vanilla and stir to mix completely --.

4. Shape the mixture into balls and arrange in a circle in a greased 9" cake pan (perhaps 6 balls 5 around and one in the middle).
5. By arranging them in this fashion you'll get an effect similar to scoring you see in scone recipes except this is achieved 'naturally' by the arrangement of the balls --.
6. At this time you can sprinkle it with the optional cinnamon sugar (trust me it's better WITH the cinnamon sugar!).
7. Bake in preheated 350°F oven for approximately 50 minute (your time may vary).
8. Allow me to repeat this will be hard upon completion and dryish -- it isn't intended to be a moist 'tea' cake (so don't be alarmed).

instructions, 1. Mix together the lemon rind rosemary sage and garlic and rub over the lamb steaks then squeeze the lemon juice over the lamb steaks.
2. Heat a large non-stick pan until hot and over a medium-high heat add the lamb steaks (and some of the lemon juice that has dripped off them when you transferred them to the pan) and fry for 1 minute on each side.
3. Remove the lamb from the pan and set aside.
4. Add the bacon onions carrot and celery to the pan and fry for 2-3 minutes or until they are beginning to soften.
5. Add the lentils and the stock – and any of the herbs and garlic that didn’t make it into the pan earlier when you were browning the lamb steaks – and over a high heat return the lamb to the pan and bring the mixture to the boil.
6. Reduce to a low-medium heat and simmer gently for 30-40 minutes or until the lentils are tender and most of the stock has been absorbed.
7. Serve the lamb with potatoes mashed with buttermilk or low-fat milk.  If the potatoes have been made ahead of time – and if you like spinach – mix through the mashed potatoes a packet of frozen spinach which has not only been thawed and thoroughly-drained but has also had all excess moisture squeezed from it.

instructions, 1. First of all pop the ingredients for the dough excluding the currants and mixed peel into the breadmaker along with 1½-2 fl oz (40-55 ml) water in the order your manual instructs. Then set it to the ‘dough raisin’ mode (or equivalent setting) and press the start button. When the ‘raisin’ bleep blinks add the currants and mixed peel and then continue to mix until the dough is ready.
2. After that turn the dough out on to a lightly floured work surface knead it briefly then divide it into 12 round portions and place them on the greased baking sheet leaving plenty of room around each one. Use a sharp knife to make a cross on the top of each bun. Then cover them with the oiled polythene bag and leave them to rise which will take about 30 minutes by which time the buns will have almost doubled in size and are ready.
3. While that’s happening pre-heat the oven to gas mark 7 425°F (220°C) and make the crosses. Form a paste with 2 oz/50 g flour and 1½-2 tablespoons water then roll this out and cut into ¼ inch (5 mm) strips. When the buns have risen brush the strips with water to make them stick and place them on top of the buns along the indentations you made earlier. Then place the baking sheet on a high shelf in the oven and bake them for about 15 minutes.
4. While they are cooking make the glaze by slowly melting together the sugar and 2 tablespoons water in a pan over a gentle heat until all the sugar grains have dissolved and you have a clear syrup. As soon as the buns come out of the oven brush them immediately with the glaze while they are still warm. If you want to make them ahead of time it’s quite nice just to warm them through again in the oven before eating. If you want to freeze them they do freeze well – just remember to put on the glaze after defrosting and then warm the buns through in the oven. Also don’t forget that stale leftover buns are brilliant toasted.,

Melt in a microwave on high power in 30 second bursts (for 100g of chocolate I'd say it usually takes me a couple of minutes or so at least but it'll no doubt depend on the power of your microwave etc. so you need to keep a close eye on it).
2. When chocolate it melted remove from microwave and add cream.
3. Mix well. Initially you'll feel like you've added too much cream and that it'll never mix together but some weird molecular thing will then happen and suddenly the whole thing will thicken and smooth out.
4. Serve immediately. Yummy yummy.,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 300 and arrange 4 4 oz. ramekins in a baking pan large enough to hold a water bath up to halfway up the ramekins.
2. In a small saucepan over low heat (or in a double boiler) simmer the evaporated milk and the vanilla bean until the surface begins to shimmer and a slight skin forms.  Do not allow to boil.  If you don't have a vanilla bean it's ok.  The vanilla just brings out the sweet flavor a little bit.
3. While the milk is simmering combine the egg whites extracts (or whatever flavorings you choose) sweetener and the salt.  Try not to whisk quickly since you don't want the egg whites to foam.  I use two forks and scissor the tongs together to try to break up the membrane in the egg whites.  Try to combine all of the ingredients as best as possible as you want to eliminate lumps in the final custard.
4. Once the surface of the warmed milk has begun to shimmer turn the heat off and allow to cool a bit so as not to cook the eggs.
5. Pour the cooled milk mixture through a strainer into the egg mixture and mix together gently.  Rinse the vanilla bean and save for future use.  Note: You may want to pour the custard mixture through a fine sieve or collander several times to discard some of the larger chunks of egg membrane and other various lumps and irregularities.
6. Once the mixture is strained to your satisfaction evenly distribute it into the four ramekins and fill the pan up to halfway up the sides of the ramekins with water.
7. Cover loosely with foil and Bake for about 40-50 minutes.  Watch them closely and do not overbake.  When done the custards should still be kind of wobbly in the center.  The less time they bake the softer your custard will be and because of the egg white substitution baking them too long will cause the custard to "Curdle."
8. Once done Remove the pan from the oven and allow the ramekins to cool in the water bath.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
9. To serve: In a small bowl mix together the sugar and brown sugar to make your brulee sugar.  Remove the ramekins from the fridge and sprinkle a teaspoon of the mixture evenly on the top of each custard.  If you have a culinary torch use it to caramelize the brulee sugar.  Try to caramelize the sugar quickly and evenly so the custards remain cool.  If you don't have a culinary torch a preheated broiler or salamander will work fine.  Just place the custards as close to the flame as possible for about 30 seconds or so.  Watch closely and do not over broil or the custards and the sugar will burn.  :(.
10. Keep in mind that this dessert will have a slightly grainy texture as compared to a typical creme brulee recipe but this one's actually ok for a night time treat --  even if you're watching your waistline!  :)  Have fun and enjoy!,

2. It's best to buy dry-cure bacon if you can as less water is released when frying ensuring really crisp fat (the best bit) and a better flavour.
3. Place a large frying pan over a medium heat and add a trickle of oil.
4. Lay the bacon in the pan and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side or until it's as crispy as you prefer. Remove the bacon and divide between 2 slices of bread. Spread either tomato ketchup or brown sauce on to the remaining 2 slices and place sauce-side down in the pan.
5. Leave for about a minute to absorb all the juices in the pan also warming (but not toasting) the bread.
6. The other 2 pieces will be warmed through by the hot bacon on top with any bacon fat seeping through the bread. Assemble the sandwiches and eat straight away.,

instructions, 1. Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Sit the 1kg beef fillet on a roasting tray brush with 1 tbsp olive oil and season with pepper then roast for 15 mins for medium-rare or 20 mins for medium. When the beef is cooked to your liking remove from the oven to cool then chill in the fridge for about 20 minutes.
2. While the beef is cooling chop 250g chestnut (and wild if you like) mushrooms as finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. You can use a food processor to do this but make sure you pulse-chop the mushrooms so they don't become a slurry.
3. Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil and 50g butter in a large pan and fry the mushrooms on a medium heat with 1 large sprig fresh thyme for about 10 mins stirring often until you have a softened mixture. Season the mushroom mixture pour over 100ml dry white wine and cook for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. The mixture should hold its shape when stirred. Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool and discard the thyme.
4. Overlap two pieces of cling film over a large chopping board. Lay 12 slices prosciutto on the cling film slightly overlapping in a double row. Spread half the duxelles over the prosciutto then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining duxelles over. Use the cling film's edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet then roll it into a sausage shape twisting the ends of cling film to tighten it as you go. Chill the fillet while you roll out the pastry.
5. Dust your work surface with a little flour. Roll out a third of the 500g pack of puff pastry pastry to a 18 x 30cm strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet. Roll out the remainder of the 500g pack of puff pastry to about 28 x 36cm. Unravel the fillet from the cling film and sit it in the centre of the smaller strip of pastry. Beat the 2 egg yolks with 1 tsp water and brush the pastry's edges and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet. Using a rolling pin carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the fillet pressing well into the sides. Trim the joins to about a 4cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle. Glaze all over with more egg yolk and using the back of a knife mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry. Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hours.
6. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Brush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk and cook until golden and crisp - 20-25 mins for medium-rare beef 30 mins for medium. Allow to stand for 10 mins before serving in thick slices.,

Relax in the fridge for 30 minutes. Roll to 1/4-inch thick and cut into 8-inch circles. Place to one side and refrigerate.
2. FOR THE FILLING: In a medium sauté pan over gentle heat add the olive oil and gently sauté the onions and garlic for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the Swiss chard and continue to cook for an additional 4 to 6 minutes seasoning with a little salt and pepper. Add the fennel seeds fresh thyme and chopped mushrooms. Continue to cook for an additional 4 to 6 minutes. Adjust the seasoning and remove from heat. Once the mixture has cooled enough to handle add the ricotta cheese mix gently and check the seasoning one more time before adding a pinch of nutmeg.
3. In the centre of the pastry disc place approx 1 1/2 tablespoons of filling egg wash the perimeter of the pastry and crimp well to seal. Brush the Cornish pasty with the egg wash and bake in a pre-heated oven 325 degrees Fahrenheit for approximately 15 to 18 minutes or until light golden brown all over.

4. bake the flapjack in the oven at about 180c for around 30 minutes or until the flapjack has browned.
5. note: if you are using raisons in your recipe you might like to cook the flapjack for a shorter time or for a longer time at a lower temperature because raisins can burn and expand with the heat.
6. once you take the flapjack out you should cut it before it cools completely because it will harden.
7. if youre impatient eat some warm (if you havent already!) but flapjack is just as delicious chilled.
8. ***** if youre a chocaholic i would recommend that when the flapjack has cooled completely you melt a black of chocolate and pour it over and wait for it to set. *****.,

instructions, 1. Roll out the pastry into two rectangles 23x30.5cm each cover and place in the fridge.
2. To make the filling heat the oil in a large pan and fry the onion with half the crushed garlic for at least 20 minutes or until it turns a deep golden colour. This is crucial as pale onions will give an insipid mix.
3. Remove onions from the pan and set aside then add the mushrooms to the same pan with the rest of the garlic and half the tarragon and cook on afairly high heat. Halfway through cooking add the soya sauce or tamari and the alcohol if you are using it.
4. Continue until the mushrooms are cooked through; there should be no white centre left when you cut one open. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Set aside reserving all the mushroom liquor (the intensely flavoured liquid given out by the mushrooms).
6. In a food processor or blender blend the cashews with the reserved mushroom liquor to a fine smooth purée adding a little water or even more of whichever alcohol you are using until you have a smooth sweet paste or pate.
7. Remove mixture from the blender and blend first the onions then mushrooms – you can mix them up if you wish – until they are perfectly smooth.
8. Mix all the blended ingredients together in a bowl adding the breadcrumbs ground almonds and the remaining tarragon. The mixture should gently hold its shape when formed with the hands.
9. Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Remove the pastry from the fridge. Divide the mixture in two and place one lot on a sheet of pastry shaping with your hands as you go to make a long rectangular shape about 28cm long 7cm wide and about 5cm high.
10. With the thin point of a sharp knife make diagonal cuts at a 45-degree angle starting from the left hand corner of the pastry towards the pate mixture. Repeat on the other side this time starting at the top right hand corner and cutting down towards the centre. The strips should now be about 2cm apart.
11. Fold in the end pieces first. Then draw a strip over from the left then one from the right crossing them over (you can tug lightly at the strips if you need to) so the mix is snugly wrapped up. Repeat for the second wellington.
12. Either freeze at this stage or glaze generously with beaten egg.
13. Place upon a floured tray using two fish slices or the loose base of a tart tin to help you.
14. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes until golden.
15. Allow to cool for a few minutes before attempting to lift onto a serving dish. Once again you'll need the help of some implements.
16. Allow 2 perfect slices per person cut with a very sharp serrated or electric knife.,

instructions, 1. Peel onions and cut them up (this is an easy peasy dish doesn't matter if rings chunks diced -- just whatever you like) Toss them into a large pan with the butter and sugar and cook until just going soft.
2. Add casserole beef (it's important to cook them together really punches up the flavour) and cook meat through.
3. While beef if cooking away peel and chop 2 of the potatoes and thinly slice the last one.
4. In casserole dish add uncooked (chopped) potatoes and meat and onion mixture cover over with the prepared gravy (to about half an inch from the top of the casserole dish.) Cover the top of dish with the sliced potatoes to cover the entire thing.
5. Pop into the oven on 200°C or about 375°F until the potatoes go soft.  If wanting to keep in longer turn oven down about 140°C or 200°F and it will cook happily for hours in the oven and it just gets better.
6. Serve with a nice loaf of fresh bread and butter.
7. or -- if you're like my man over mashed potatoes with Yorkshire puddings!
8. Optional add-ins: (not traditional lol) any root veggies are a nice colourful addition (carrot sweet potato etc -- ) also a bit of A1 sauce really punches up the flavour while you're cooking the beef --.
9. Also good in crock pot but just chop all 3 potatoes as it doesn't matter if you have any on top in the crock pot.

2. To make the crumble topping sift the flour and ginger into a bowl and rub in the butter until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs (you don’t have to be too precise about this as the topping melts into the cake during baking):  stir in the sugar and set aside.
3. For the cake mixture cream the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy; gradually beat in the eggs one at a time adding a little of the flour with each egg to prevent curdling:  fold the remaining flour and chopped dates into the mixture.
4. Spoon the cake mixture into the prepared tin and when it is all in the tin finish off by making a slight hollow in the centre with the back of a spoon:  layer the sliced apples evenly over the top of the cake mixture pressing the slices down slightly as you work:  scatter the crumble mix over the top.
5. Bake for 50 – 60 minutes until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean:  cool the cake in the tin for 10 minutes then serve warm with custard or cream.,

instructions, 1. Preparation.
2. Combine all pork stuffing ingredients in a bowl and  mix thoroughly by hand.
3. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
4. Gently fry the onions mushroom and garlic in the olive oil.  Leave cooking though on a low heat for 20 minutes whilst preparing the raw meat as below.
5. Take the pork fillet and double-butterfly it.  i.e. using a very sharp knife cut a slice 95% of the way across along the length of the fillet – 1/3 of the way down.  The fillet should now be twice the width with 1/3 of the thickness on 1 side and 2/3 on the other.
6. Turn the chopping board around and now slice the thicker piece in half again 95% of the way across.  The fillet should now be 3 times its original width – top third to one side and middle third to the other.
7. Using a very sharp knife slice the chicken breast into several thin wide slices and set aside.
8. Set the mushroom mixture to one side to cool.  It may be worth leaving in a sieve for the excess juices to drain.
9. Assembly.
10. Lay the streaky bacon out across a chopping board in rows.  Spread each rasher out using the back of a knife/your thumb until increased in length by ~20%.  You need to have enough rashers that side by side they are wider than your pork fillet is long.  They also need to be significantly longer than the potential circumference of your pork fillet roulade as they will be holding it in shape during cooking.
11. Lay the double-butterflied pork fillet out across the bacon.
12. Spread the pate evenly across the pork.
13. Spread the mushroom mixture across the pate.
14. Place the raw chicken slices across the pate/mushroom mix (if there is insufficient chicken to cover the pork spread the chicken with the back of a knife to thin & broaden each slice).
15. Spread the Pork stuffing evenly across the chicken.
16. Roll up the pork fillet placing join-side down onto the middle of the bacon rashers.
17. Fold the bacon rashers over the top of the back of the pork fillet ensuring all of the pork fillet is covered by bacon.
18. Sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper.
19. Cooking.
20. Place on a baking tray and cook in a pre-heated oven (200C / 180c Fan) for 40 minutes or until cooked through and bacon browning.
21. Remove and leave to rest on a chopping board for 5-10 minutes covered in tin foil.
22. Carve.
23. Serve with:
24. Steamed savoy cabbage sprinkled with caraway seeds.  When cooked toss in a knob of butter  and a small turn of black pepper.
25. Carrots quartered lengthways and roasted in butter basil & lemon juice (Optional: small amount of extra virgin olive oil).
26. Special Mash.
27. Gravy from meat juices home-made chicken stock and veg water with a little cornflour.,

cuisine, European >> UK >> English, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Cut the chilled butter into chunks each about the size of a sugar cube.
2. Sift the flour into a bowl then add the sugar  cinnamon and the salt if you are using it.  Add the butter chunks evenly over the surface of the flour.
3. Using your thumb and forefingers rub the butter into the flour (this is easier with smaller chunks of butter).  Continue until the butter is all incorporated.  The mix should resemble biscuit/bread crumbs when it is ready.
4. Add the water a little at a time mixing thoroughly with a good sized spoon.  When the mix reaches a smooth (and slightly sticky) consistency (which should look like cookie-dough) shape it into a ball and wrap it in cling film.  Refrigerate the dough for 1 hour.
5. When the dough is nearly chilled start making the filling. Peel de-core and cut the apples into orange-segment-sized wedges. Place them in cold water if you are leaving them for any length of time to prevent them from browning.
6. Mix the water muscavado and light-brown sugars cinnamon lemon juice (and nutmeg & cloves if being used) in a jug/bowl.
7. Melt the butter on a medium-high heat in a deep pan. Put the apples in and stir gently for 2-3 minutes.
8. Add the liquid mix to the pan keeping the heat at medium-high.  Keep gently folding the mixture for 5 minutes until the apples begin to look mushy/fluffy (as boiled and shaken potatoes do).  The apples will break up to some degree during this process - this is perfectly fine. The apples should all be darkened in colour if you've done this bit right.  Leave the filling to cool in the air for about 10 minutes.  During this time the fruit will begin to congeal a little more.
9. Take the dough from the fridge. Divide it into two balls and roll each one out into a disc each slightly larger than the top of an 8" diameter pie dish (by about 1" all round).  Use a lightly floured surface to prevent sticking; rubbing flour onto the rolling pin will also help.  By rolling one way then the other you can easily achieve a neat circle.  I prefer to use my hands to shape and flatten the dough however.
10. Rub butter onto the pie dish (including the up-facing lip/edge of the dish). Place the first dough-disc squarely into the dish - make sure it sits flat against the walls of the dish and that it covers the lip of the dish with a little extra (which you will trim in a minute).
11. It is time to add the filling now - but make sure you drain it well!  Either sieve off the liquid or use a slotted spoon to remove as much liquid as possible - if the filling is too wet the pasty will not cook properly.  You can keep the liquid to drink warmed as a delicious punch or even use as a sauce if you don't like creamy/custard like sauces on your pie.  If you refrigerate it this sauce will thicken up a bit.
12. Next whisk up the egg and 2 tablespoons of water.  Paint the mixture onto the lip of the pastry (using a pastry brush or your fingertips).  This will glue the two halves together.
13. Now place your other pastry disc on top of the pie.  Using a sharp knife cut down through the top of the pastry to remove the excess.  Use the edge of the pie dish to guide your knife - the pastry should be flush with the edge of the dish.
14. Using one or two fingers work around the edge of the pie crimping the pastry together. As well as adding an attractive fluted edge to the crust this will help to glue the edges together.
15. Cut a series of 3 or 4 slashes into the top of the pastry ensuring you go right through.  This will allow trapped air to escape and prevent the pastry from cracking open in an uncontrolled manner during cooking. If you have a pie-spout you can use this instead.
16. Glaze the top of the pie with more of the egg glaze mix (don't feel that you must use all of it - you'll make the pasty soggy if you do!).
17. Use a sieve to dust the top with the icing sugar and cinnamon.
18. Place in a preheated oven middle shelf at around 180 Celcius.  Cook for around 30-40 minutes (fan assisted ovens will be quicker).
19. When the top is browned and the pastry is firm all over take the dish from the oven and cool on a wire rack for around 20-30 minutes.  DO NOT remove the pie from the dish until it has cooled as it will most likely disintegrate!
20. To make the Crème Anglaise sauce place the milk in a pan.  Add the sugar and vanilla (if using vanilla pods you can use the seeds from a pod and or the pod itself.  I have successfully used a pod which has been in a box of sugar for 3 months to make vanilla sugar and it worked perfectly).  Heat gently for 10 minutes stirring occasionally to allow the vanilla to infuse into the milk properly.
21. In a jug/bowl place the cornflour and add a little milk (roughly 1 tablespoon milk to 2 tablespoons of cornflour).  Stir thoroughly until it forms a thick paste adding a little more milk if necessary.
22. Pour the mix into the milk pan stirring it in thoroughly.  Bring the milk to a boil stirring continuously all the while.  Be very careful and make sure you are using a non-stick pan here as the sauce can easily burn on the bottom.  As soon as the sauce thickens to the consistency of custard/thick pureed soup remove it from the heat.  Continue to stir for a while to make sure the latent heat does not burn the sauce at the bottom of the pan.
23. Pour liberally (hot or cold) onto hot or cold apple pie and enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 400 F 200 C gas mark 6; peel the potatoes and cut them into evenly sized halves or chunks.
2. Put the potatoes into a large saucepan cover with cold salted water and bring to the boil; drain the water off as soon as it comes to the boil  - this step isn’t to cook the potatoes: it heats them through so they start roasting more quickly - return the potatoes to the hot pan and dry them over the heat (it is important that the potatoes are dry for roasting otherwise they are likely to stick to the baking tray).
3. Slide a large baking tray into the oven to heat up for a few minutes add the vegetable fat to the potatoes in the hot pan and let it melt; turn the potatoes in the melted fat until they are shiny and well coated then tip them onto the hot baking tray.
4. Place the tray in the oven for about 45 minutes; add the bay leaves if using 15 minutes into the cooking time; turn and baste the potatoes a few times during cooking.
5. To serve lift the potatoes from the baking tray with a slotted spoon sprinkle with sea salt if desired: NOTE - if you are unable to serve the potatoes immediately do not cover them (they’ll loose their crispiness); instead keep them warm in the oven until you are ready.,

2. Cook for about 30 minutes until potatoes become mush.
3. Mash up potatoes and veggie mixture.
4. (If you are impatient you can put this into a blender or food processor to puree- just like Bridget did. But be careful WARNING: make sure the soup is not boiling hot when you pour it into the blender or food processor- or else the same thing will happen to you that happened to Bridget where the contents comes spewing out all over the room.  And let me tell you you will NOT be yelling "Oh Bugger!  Oh Bugger Bugger!" you will be screaming bloody murder and in the hospital with 3rd degree burns.  Make sure you cool the mixture first please - remember Bridget Jones's Diary was a movie in real life what she did was quite dangerous).
5. After the soup is pureed add a couple of drops of blue food colouring- how much is up to you and how blue you want your soup to be.
6. Mix soup well to blend in the food colouring.
7. Just before serving add a little sour cream on top of blue soup if you desire and garnish with chopped chives.
8. If you are seriously a die hard Bridget fan you can add a few strands of string- but I don't recommend it- this is meant to be a delicious edible version of this novelty soup.,

2. Grilling  --  I prefer to grill the shrimp on a outdoor or inside grill if possible. You could also broil or even pan saute but grilling to me works best. They only take just a couple of minutes. Just until they start to curl and start to turn pink. Remove let cool slightly and then rough chop.  You could easily make these ahead of time.
3. Muffins  --  Slice them in half and then just toast under the broiler until slightly brown.  They will take just a minute and watch them carefully.
4. Cheese  --  In a small bowl mix both cheeses so you always get a good blend of both cheese when you add it to your muffins.
5. Toppings  --  Top each muffin with a tablespoon of the salsa verde (green salsa) then 1/2 of the cheese shrimp olives cilantro a few red pepper flakes and the other 1/2 of the cheese.  Place on a baking sheet.

instructions, 1. Preheat your oven to 375°F Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets or a full-size or mini-scone pan.
2. To make the scones: In a blender or food processor process 1/2 cup of the strawberries with the half and half or cream until the mixture is smooth. Set it aside.
3. In a large bowl whisk together the flour salt sugar and baking powder. Cut in the butter using your fingertips a fork or a pastry blender.
4. In a separate bowl whisk together the strawberry/half and half mixture the egg and the vanilla extract. Stir this mixture into the dry ingredients. Add the 2/3 cup diced strawberries and stir just until everything is well-combined. This is a wet sticky dough good for drop scones.
5. Drop the dough by heaping tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets; each scone should be about the size of a golf ball. A tablespoon cookie scoop is exactly the right size for this task. Or divide the dough among the compartments of the scone pan of your choice. Bake the scones until they're golden brown 15 to 16 minutes (on a baking sheet or in a mini-scone pan) or 18 to 20 minutes (in a standard scone pan). Remove the scones from the oven when they're beginning to brown around the edges. Break one open just to be sure; they should be moist but not gummy at the center.
6. To make the topping: As soon as you remove the scones from the oven make the topping. Combine the sugar and water in a very small (e.g. 1/4- to 1/3-cup size) microwave-safe bowl stirring until the sugar is moistened. Heat in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds until the mixture is bubbly. Carefully remove from the microwave (sugar syrup is very hot) and stir in the vanilla. Stir until the mixture smoothes out. Drizzle or brush the topping over the hot scones.
7. Yield: 8 to 18 scones depending on your choice of pan.,

6. Cool after pan toasting and eat immediately or place a piece of parchment paper between each half then into a zippered freezer bag. Into the freezer they go.
7. Take out night before needed and defrost in fridge. If you don't have the time you can take out of freezer when needed and defrost in microwave for 25 seconds. How ever you defrost them you need to pan toast them again or put in toaster oven (not a toaster) for a toast cycle.,

instructions, 1. Pre-heat your oven to 400 Degrees F.
2. Grease a 9" Corningwear or deep glass bowl in your favorite method.  I rub butter in mine but you can use cooking spray instead.
3. Place one pie crust in the bottom of the greased bowl. (To cut down on cooking time you can pre-cook this crust for about 15 minutes before you add any more ingredients.).
4. Open all ingredients drain all the vegetables but do not drain the chicken and pre-mix everything in a separate bowl.  If you want more chicken add a 2nd can of Tyson pre-cooked chicken breast.  If you do drain the broth into another bowl and slowly mix in some of it so that it's not too soupy.
5. Once the ingredients are well blended pour them over your pre-cooked crust spreading them out evenly.
6. Take your 2nd crust and cover the ingredients.  Pinch the edges with the bottom crust if possible to form an envelope around the chicken and vegetables.  Don't worry if this is not perfect.
7. Cut a 1"x1" X in the top of the crust to allow heat to escape without expoding your pie.
8. Put the pie in the oven and bake until the top crust is golden brown.  Usually 20-30 minutes.  The ingredients inside are pre-cooked so they only need to be hot.
9. Spoon pie onto plate or into bowl and allow to cool slightly before serving.,

Gradually stir in the flour thyme 2 cups water Kitchen Bouquet seasoning beef bouillon cubes and Worcestershire sauce.
2. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the meat (so that it is just bubbling) for about 30 to 45 minutes until the sauce has thickened and the meat is fork tender. Remove the pan from the stove and use a slotted spoon to transfer the beef to the earthenware dish. The slotted spoon will lift just the beef so it will not be too wet to hold the potatoes.

5. Dust lightly with flour & place inside a large clean plastic bag. Allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in size.

7. Cover again with the plastic bag & leave to double in size.
8. When doubled brush the exposed dough with the beaten egg yolk & sprinkle your choice of seeds of sea salt over the top.

instructions, 1. THE DOUGH:
2. Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup tepid water while the yeast is dissolving place the flour in a large mixing bowl. Beat the cold milk into the potatoes and then add to the flour. After the flour mixture has warmed to tepid add the dissolved yeast and beat vigorously for a minute or so until it has become a thick smooth batter. Thicker than regular pancake batter but not at all like conventional dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for about 1 1/2 hours preferably at 80°F (27°C) until batter has risen and large bubbles have appeared on the surface (the surface must be bubbly however long it takes).
3. Dissolve the salt in 3 tablespoons tepid water and beat the batter down.  Then add the salt and beat vigorously for a minute.
4. Once again cover for an hour or more until the surface of the batter has become bubbly.
5. The batter is now ready to become English muffins.
6. COOKING THE MUFFINS:
7. When you are ready to cook the muffins brush the insides of the tins or rings generously with the butter; butter the surface of the griddle or frying pan as well. Place the tins on the griddle/frying pan and set on medium heat.
8. With a ladle are large spoon scoop the batter up and dislodge the batter from
9. the spoon with rubber spatula into the tins. Batter should be about 3/8 inch (1 cm) thick to make a muffin twice that. (Batter should be heavy sticky sluggish but not runny having just enough looseness to be spread out into the ring).
10. The muffins are to cook slowly on one side until it bubbles which form near the bottom of the muffin. When the top of the muffin's color changes from a wet ivory white to a dry gray color; this will take 6 to 8 minutes or more depending on the heat (regulate heat so that bottoms of muffins do not color more than a light to medium brown).
11. Now the muffins are ready to be turned over for a brief cooking on the other side. At this point you can probably lift the tins off them (if getting the tins off is difficult then gently cut around the edge with a knife).
12. Less than a minute is generally enough for cooking the other side which needs a token brown color.
13. Cool muffins on a rack.
14. Wrap in air-tight plastic bags or wrap and store in the fridge.
15. Cut in half and/or re-heat in the toaster and spread whatever you fancy on them!,

instructions, 1. for the chocolate chip scones:
2. Preheat oven to 425°. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a bowl stir together flour brown sugar baking powder baking soda and salt.
3. With a pastry blender or two knives cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in chocolate chips. Make a well in the center and add buttermilk vanilla and egg. Stir just until combined taking care to not overmix.
4. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead 5 or 6 times. Pat into an 8'' circle and cut into 8 wedges. Transfer to prepared baking sheet about 1-1/2'' apart. Brush each wedge of dough lightly with milk. Then bake until scones are golden brown 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on pan for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
5. for the peanut butter glaze:
6. After removing the scones from the oven prepare the glaze. In a glass measuring cup whisk together all glaze ingredients until smooth. When the scones are mostly cooled (they can be slightly warm yet) drizzle the peanut butter glaze over the scones.  I put this in the microwave for 30 seconds 2 or 3 times to help it smooth out nicely.
7. I believe scones are always best the day they are baked. But this recipe does allow for some advance prep. The unbaked dough freezes really well enabling you to store the unbaked scones in your freezer and bake them up fresh when desired. Just cut the dough into wedges place them on a tray in the freezer for an hour and then transfer the frozen wedges to a plastic freezer bag. On the day you want to bake them take them directly from freezer to baking sheet lined with parchment paper (do not thaw first) and brush with milk. You will need to bake the frozen dough a bit longer adding about 4 or 5 minutes onto the regular baking time.,

instructions, 1. To cook the beetroots: trim the stalk not cutting the root as this prevents the beetroot from bleeding.
2. Place the beetroots in a small saucepan cover with cold water and add a pinch of salt.
3. Bring to a rapid simmer and cook for 50-60 minutes until tender.
4. Rather than piercing them to check their tenderness lift the beetroots from the water and gently pull at the skin with your thumb.
5. If the skin feels loose and is easy to remove the beetroots are ready to be drained and left to cool.
6. Preheat the oven to 200C or 400 degrees F.
7. To cook the parsnips and carrots: peel the carrots and parsnips trim away the top stalk and quarter lengthwise to produce sharp sticks.
8. The central core of the parsnips can also be trimmed away should they appear to be woody.
9. The vegetables can be roasted from absolutely raw but a short blanching will give them a creamier finish.
10. Preheat a roasting tray on top of the stove adding the oil.
11. Add the carrots and parsnips and fry on all sides until well coloured.
12. Season with salt and pepper.
13. Place the roasting tray in the preheated oven and cook for 15-20 minutes turning the vegetables from time to time until they are becoming crispy.
14. Remove the vegetables from the oven and season with salt and pepper.
15. These are best served very warm rather than piping hot.
16. While the carrots and parsnips are roasting dice the beetroots.
17. To make the dressing whisk together the mustard soured cream and vinegar.
18. The oil can now be trickled in as you whisk allowing it to emulsify with the cream.
19. If the dressing is too thick simply loosen with a little water.
20. Season with salt and pepper.
21. You may only need half to two thirds of the dressing; any leftover can be kept in the fridge for several days to be used with other salads.
22. Once the beetroot is diced mix half with the dressing and this will create a pink rippled effect.
23. Arrange the carrots and parsnips in a rustic fashion on four serving plates sprinkling with the remaining diced beetroots.
24. Or if using grated beetroots simply divide between the plates.
25. Break the walnut halves into pieces and mix them with the salad leaves then drizzle with extra walnut oil if liked.
26. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle on top of the carrots and parsnips.
27. Spoon over and around with the beetroot and soured cream dressing to finish.,

instructions, 1. If rabbit is not already prepared wash it and trim away any skin and unwanted parts.  Most rabbits come with the kidneys and other organs regardless of whether they are prepared.  Reserve these.
2. Mix sausage meat and breadcrumbs together kneading in the rosemary.  Stuff the chest cavity of the rabbit with the stuffing and continue down the torso leaving a firm mound of stuffing from chest-groin.
3. Wrap bacon rashers around rabbit securing at the back with toothpicks to seal stuffing inches.
4. Roast rabbit on a medium/low heat for 1 hour turning from one side to the other regularly and basting with any leaked juices.
5. Meanwhile boil potatoes in lightly salted water until firm but starchy on the outide.  Drain.
6. Remove rabbit from roasting tray and set aside.  Add lard to tray - once melted toss in the pearl onions (whole) the carrots (roughly chopped into large pieces) and the potatoes.  Toss vegetables in meat juices and lard then replace rabbit on top.  Roast a further 30 minutes spooning over the hot lard as required or until onions begin to blacken and potatoes turn golden and crisp.
7. Using a slotted spoon remove and set aside the rabbit and vegetables allowing each spoonful to drain any juices back into the roasting pan.
8. Pour stock into pan and scrape the bottom to lift up any stuck pieces of meat or vegetable and to thoroughly combine the stock with the juices.
9. Pour mixed stock and juice into a pot adding a sprig of rosemary and the reserved rabbit organs.  Place rabbit and vegetables back in over on a very low setting to keep warm.
10. When stock reaches a rolling boil mix the teaspoon of flour with a little water to form a paste and add to the stock.  Once thick and rich taste and season to preference.  Strain stock to remove organs and rosemary.
11. Serve rabbit surrounded with the roasted vegetables and with the stock offered on the side as a gravy.  Goes beautifully with redcurrant jelly.,

instructions, 1. After catching and killing the fish pop it into boiling water for a few seconds to help remove the slimy coating. Though a knife will often be all that's needed to scrape it away any remaining vestiges can be rubbed off the skin with a rough cloth. Cut off the tail (usually about 6 inches long) then tie a string around the head and suspend the fish over the sink to drain the blood. Open bronchial holes on the side of the fish and allow the blood to empty Then remove the intestines and notocordium (the long dark bitter-tasting organ running down the abdomen). Rinse the fish again and then decapitate it by slicing around the body and pulling off the head. If you don't want crunchy lamprey make sure the thick bony cartilage comes out with the head. Discard both.
2. Cut cleaned fish into 3" lengths.
3. Combine in a pan with the mushrooms parsley wine and pearl onions; season to taste with nutmeg salt and black pepper.
4. Bring to a simmer; cover and cook slowly for about 40 minutes or until the lampreys are very tender.

instructions, 1. In a 5 or 6 quart bowl or lidded food storage container mix the water and the milk together and then add the yeast salt and malt powder. Because we are mixing in the flour so quickly it doesn’t matter that the salt and yeast are thrown in together. If you are using the fresh cake yeast break it up.
2. Dump in the flour along with the dates and pecans all at once and stir with a long handled wooden spoon or a Danish dough whisk which is one of the tools that makes the job so much easier!
3. Stir it until all of the wheat is incorporated into the dough. It will be a wet rough dough.
4. Put the lid on the container but do not snap it shut. You want the gases from the yeast to escape. (You could put a little hole in the top of the lid so that you could close the lids and still allow the gases to get out.). Allow the dough to sit at room temperature for about 2 hours to rise. When you first mix the dough it will not occupy much of the container. But after the initial 2 hour rise it will pretty much fill it. (If you have decreased the yeast you will have to let it go longer than 2 hours.) DO NOT PUNCH DOWN THE DOUGH! Just let it settle by itself.
5. The dough will be flat on the top and some of the bubbles may even appear to be popping. (If you intend to refrigerate the dough after this stage it can be placed in the refrigerator even if the dough is not perfectly flat. The yeast will continue to work even in the refrigerator.) The dough can be used right after the initial 2 hour rise but it is much easier to handle when it is chilled. It is intended for refrigeration and use over the next week and a half ready for you anytime. The flavor will deepen over that time developing sourdough characteristics.
6. The next day when you pull the dough out of the refrigerator you will notice that it has collapsed and this is totally normal for this type of dough. It will never rise up again in the container.
7. Dust the surface of the dough with a little flour just enough to prevent it from sticking to your hands when you reach in to pull a piece out.
8. You should notice that the dough has a lot of stretch once it has rested. (If your dough breaks off instead of stretching your dough is probably too dry and you can just add a few tablespoons of water and let it sit again until the dough absorbs the additional water.).
9. At this point you can divide the dough into 4 one pound balls and freeze them in airtight containers for up to three weeks. Allow 24 hours in refrigerator to thaw before use. You can also leave the dough in its container in the refrigerator for up to 10 days cutting off pieces as needed.
10. When ready to bake cut off a 1-pound piece of dough using kitchen shears and hold in your hands. Add a little more flour so it will not stick to your hands. Gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides rotating the ball a quarter turn as you go. Most of the dusting flour will fall off; it's not intended to be incorporated into the dough. The correctly shaped final product will be smooth and cohesive.
11. Rest the loaf on a generous layer of flour on top of a pizza peel. Let the dough rest for at least 40 minutes (although letting it go 60 or even 90 minutes will give you a more open hole structure in the interior of the loaf. This may also improve the look of your loaf and prevent it from splitting on the bottom. ) You will notice that the loaf does not rise much during this rest in fact it may just spread sideways this is normal for this type of dough.
12. Twenty minutes before baking preheat the oven to 400 degrees F with a baking stone on the center rack with a metal broiler tray on the bottom (never use a glass vessel for this or it will shatter) which will be used to produce steam. (The tray needs to be at least 4 or 5 inches away from your stone to prevent it from cracking.).
13. Dust the top of the loaf with more flour. Slide the loaf into the oven onto the preheated stone and add a cup of hot tap water to the broiler tray. Quickly close the oven door. Bake the bread for 35 minutes or until a deep brown color. To insure that you get the best results it is crucial to have an Oven Thermometer to make sure your oven is accurate.
14. Allow the loaf to cool on a rack until it is room temperature.,

4. 3. Now all you have to do is put all the cake ingredients – flour sugar baking powder and bicarb cocoa butter eggs vanilla and sour cream – into a food processor and process until you have a smooth thick batter. If you want to go the long way around just mix the flour sugar and leavening agents in a large bowl and beat in the soft butter until you have a combined and creamy mixture. Now whisk together the cocoa sour cream vanilla and eggs and beat this into your bowl of mixture.
5. 4. Divide this batter using a rubber spatula to help you scrape and spread into the prepared tins and bake until a cake tester or a thin skewer comes out clean which should be about 35 minutes but it is wise to start checking at 25. Also it might make sense to switch the two cakes around in the oven halfway through cooking time.
6. 5. Remove the cakes in their tins to a wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes before turning out of their tins. Don’t worry about any cracks as they will easily be covered by the icing later.
7. Frosting.
8. 1. To make this icing melt the butter and chocolate in a good-sized bowl either in the microwave or suspended over a pan of simmering water. Go slowly either way: you don’t want any burning or seizing.
9. 2. While the chocolate and butter are cooling a little sieve the icing sugar into another bowl. Or easier still put the icing sugar into the food processor and blitz. This is by far and away the least tedious way of removing lumps.
10. 3. Add the golden syrup to the cooled chocolate mixture followed by the sour cream and vanilla and then when all this is combined whisk in the sieved icing sugar. Or just pour this mixture down the funnel of the food processor on to the icing sugar with the motor running.
11. 4. When you’ve done you may need to add a little boiling water – say a teaspoon or so – or indeed some more icing sugar: it depends on whether you need the icing to be runnier or thicker; or indeed it may be right as it is. It should be liquid enough to coat easily but thick enough not to drip off.
12. 5. Choose your cake stand or plate and cut out four strips of baking parchment to form a square outline on it (this stops the icing running on to the plate). Then sit one of the cakes uppermost (ie slightly domed) side down.
13. 6. Spoon about a third of the icing on to the centre of the cake half and spread with a knife or spatula until you cover the top of it evenly. Sit the other cake on top normal way up pressing gently to sandwich the two together.
14. 7. Spoon another third of the icing on to the top of the cake and spread it in a swirly textured way (though you can go for a smooth finish if you prefer and have the patience). Spread the sides of the cake with the remaining icing and leave a few minutes till set then carefully pull away the paper strips.
15. 8. I love to dot the top of this with sugar pansies – and you must admit they do look enchanting – but there really is no need to make a shopping expedition out of it. Anything or indeed nothing will do.,

instructions, 1. Trim the turkey breast so that it's a more oval shape (which means cutting pieces off the neck end that you will use later).  Tie with a 2cm (1inch) gap between each loop of string to give a rounded shape.
2. Heat 2-3 Tbsp cooking oil in a large skillet.  Season turkey and fry in pan until golden all over.  Remove from pan and cool.  Place in refrigerator to firm up before removing the string.
3. For the stuffing cook onions in 2 Tbsp butter for a few minutes until soft.  Remove from heat and cool.  Roughly chop turkey trimmings and blitz in food processor until smooth.  Add sausages and blitz again 30-40 seconds until mixed together.  Season and mix in eggs (with wooden spoon or blitz again).
4. Spoon stuffing into a large bowl.  Mix in onions cranberries chestnut puree and breadcrumbs.  Add seasoning.  Chill in fridge.
5. Thin out bacon by rolling between two sheets of cling film (you'll need to do this in batches).  Chill bacon rashers on tray until needed.
6. Roll puff pastry on lightly floured surface to a rectangle approximately 45X35cm (18X14inches).  Lay bacon rashers on top of pastry leaving a 3-4 cm (1 1/4 inch) border all the way around.  Slightly overlap the bacon rashers as they are laid on the pastry to allow for shrinkage as it cooks.  (You'll need about 14-15 rashers).
7. Spread cranberry stuffing over bacon reserving a few tablespoons.  Remove the string from the turkey and lay the breast lengthwise presentation side down on top of stuffing.  Spread reserved stuffing along centre and top of turkey.  Rap turkey and stuffing roll with bacon by lifting 4-5 bacon rashers at a time and pressing into the turkey breast.  Continue until both sides have been lifted.  Lay remaining rashers lengthwise on the top covering stuffing that was spread there.
8. Bring one long side of pastry up and over the turkey.  Brush the other long side with beaten egg along the 3-4cm (1-1/4inch) border and press to seal.  Brush both ends with beaten egg and fold up to seal.  Turn carefully so that wellington is presentation-side-up and place on lightly oiled baking tray.  Chill.
9. To cook wellington preheat oven to 200°C Gas mark 6.  Bake 1 hour 15minutes to 1 hour 25 minutes max.  After first 45 minutes brush wellington with beaten egg to colour the pastry.  Once cooked remove from oven and rest for 15-20 minutes before lifting carefully on to a carving board with two large fish slices.
10. While wellington is baking make the sauce.  Melt 2 Tbsp butter in a pan and add shallots or onions.  Cook on medium high heat until golden.  Add honey and cook until almost caramelised.  Add red wine vinegar and red wine.  bring to the boil and reduce by half.  Add water or stock and return to simmer.  Mix flour with 1 Tbsp butter.  Whisk into sauce a bit at a time.  Return sauce to boil and simmer a few more minutes.  Strain through a sieve and season.  Slice the wellington and serve with potatoes and brussel sprouts.,

instructions, 1. Put the milk over moderate heat in pan of suitable size (you don't want too much surface area to prevent too much milk from evaporating).
2. Combine the egg yolks sugar and corn starch in a heavy-bottomed pan. When the milk boils turn down the heat.
3. Combine the milk with sugar/egg-yolk mixture bit by bit making sure the mixture is completely dissolved in the milk. Now add the vanilla extract or other flavouring.
4. Now turn on the heat (not too high but you don't have to be extremely careful either) and keep stirring until the mixture starts to boil again and then turn off the heat. I like to use a whisk which helps to mix everything well and make the custard slightly fluffy.
5. If you feel the custard is too fluid even after it has boiled you can consider adding a bit more corn starch but be very sure to mix it with some milk first and be sure to not let the custard continue boiling for too long.
6. Pour the custard into serving dishes. The custard can be served while hot (but wait a few minutes or you'll burn your mouth) or after letting it cool down (it will thicken slightly while cooling down).,

instructions, 1. Mix all the seasoning mix ingredients together and store in a jar until needed.
2. Remove all the wrapping from the chicken and snip the elasticated string that ties the chicken together. Wipe the chicken all over with kitchen paper to dry the skin. Sprinkle a good amount of rock salt over making sure that you cover all the chicken. Now chill overnight or for at least 8 hours so the salt can draw out any excess moisture.
3. Preheat the oven to 190C 375F or gas mark 5.
4. Remove the chicken from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking brush and shake off the excess rock salt.
5. Place the chicken in the roasting tin and season inside the cavity. Push the lemon and onion inside with the herbs. These will produce steam and flavour to keep the chicken moist. Brush the chicken all over with melted butter or olive oil then season liberally with the rest of the seasoning mix. (The salt makes the skin crispy and the butter will keep the chicken moist.).
6. Roast the chicken breast side up in the centre of the oven for 1 hour then carefully remove the chicken and with two roasting forks to aid you turn the chicken over so the breast is underneath now. Continue to cook for a further 30 minutes. Then take the chicken out and turn it over once more with the breast side up now and continue to roast for a further 15 minutes until crispy and golden brown.
7. To check that it is cooked pierce the fattest part of the thigh with a fine skewer. If the juices are pink or show traces of blood cook the chicken a further 10-15 minutes then check again. If the juices are pale golden the chicken is cooked.
8. Using two forks lift the chicken from the roasting tin onto a large plate and reserve the cooking juices. Leave for 10 minutes before carving. This allows the juices which have risen to the surface during cooking to be reabsorbed into the meat to give a moist texture.
9. Cook's tips.
10. How to make Gravy.
11. Drain all but 3 tbsp of the juices from the roasting tin. Set the roasting tin on a hob and reheat the juices. Sprinkle in 2 tsp of plain flour and stir well with a wooden spoon. Gradually stir in 300ml chicken stock. Bring to the boil stirring until thickened and smooth. Season well. If the gravy is bland add a little mustard and a splash of soy sauce. For a special gravy some of the stock can be replaced with red or white wine.
12. Carving the Chicken.
13. Hold the chicken steady with a fork then insert a large sharp knife between the body and leg. Cut off the leg. Divide the leg in half at the joint to give a drumstick and thigh portion. Cut away the wing on the same side. Carve down the breast in thick slices. Repeat on the other side of the chicken.,

instructions, 1. Put the butter and salt into the microwave for about 1 minute or until the butter melts.
2. Remove and whisk for 30 seconds to allow the mixture to cool slightly and then add in the egg yolks salt and lemon juice and continue to whisk until the mixture thickens.
3. The trick with hollandaise is to keep it in a warm place until you are ready to serve it. If the temperature is too hot the mixture will curdle. We always used to keep the hollandaise on the back of the AGA which seems to be just the right temperature for it.
4. If your mixture does curdle you can save it by adding a splash of cold water or if this fails whisk in another egg yolk.,

instructions, 1. First you have to boil the water - don't just heat it boil it. Second add the boiling water to the tea bag not the other way round. - putting the water in the cup and adding the bag to it - is a recipe for disaster. Unless the water is at boiling point when it makes contact with the tea the tea will never properly brew.
2. Make sure the cup or pot is nice and hot before you start. If necessary rinse it out with near-boiling water. And keep it covered while the tea is brewing.
3. Leave the bag in the water for at least two minutes - longer if you like your tea strong. And for goodness sake resist the temptation to dunk. Just leave the bag alone until the drink is ready!  Add milk and sugar to taste.,

2. Soak the gelatin in cold water per package directions.  (Do not let soak too long follow package directions).
3. In a small saucepan heat the water and dissolve the gelatin in the hot water.
4. USING CREAM WHIPPER:
5. Add the gelatin water to the balsamic vinegar and pour the solution into a clean cream whipper.
6. Charge the cream whipper with 2 Nitrous Oxide pellets and shake vigorously.  Cool the cream whipper in the fridge to soft set the gelatine.
7. USING HAND MIXER OR STAND MIXER:

9. Whip to soft peaks and then put whipping bowl in the refrigerator to soft set the gelatin.
10. BEFORE SERVING:
11. Before serving shake the cream whipper vigorously and squirt the foam into a small dish to serve with the warm crispy salty potatoes.  (Or whip to foamy state in whipping bowl and put in small dish.).
12. SALTY CRISPY POTATOES:
13. Peel the potatoes.  Use a Japanese mandolin to slice the potato thinly (wafer thin).  Place the sliced potatoes in a deep bucket of water.  Wash the potatoes under cold running water to remove as much of the starch as possible.
14. Heat the deep fryer to 160 degrees C (325 F).  (Or preheat oven to 175 C or 350 F.).
15. Drain the potatoes and pat them as dry as possible.
16. FRY the slices of potato in small batches and stir them all the time to prevent them from sticking together.  Once they are golden brown and crisp remove them from the fryer with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels.  Immediately dust them with coarse sea salt.
17. Alternatively BAKE the potato slices in a single layer on top of parchment-paper covered baking sheet.  Spray with nonstick cooking spray.  Bake until golden brown about 10-15 minutes then remove to paper towel lined plate.  Immediately dust them with coarse sea salt.

Remember to boil well for 10 minutes before simmering or you may get a tummy upset!
2. Heat a large pan and add the bacon if using (if not using make sure you use something else to lift the beans - more salt a bit of chili worcester sauce or whatever.  These can also be added to the bacon version for still more flavour).  Fry for 1 minute.
3. Add the onion celery (I use celery salt) and garlic and continue to fry for 4-5 minutes until the bacon is cooked and the onion has started to soften.
4. Stir in the chopped tomatoes black treacle and tomato puree.  Bring to a simmer then stir in the cooked beans.  Return to the boil and simmer for about 10 minutes (or put into crockpot on low to be ready and waiting later).
5. Stir in the chopped parsley then spoon over toast into jacket potato or whatever.

4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and flatten under you palms or use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll it out to about 1/4 inch thick. Use a round 3-inch cookie cutter to cut out cakes. You should be able to get 12 or 13 from the dough.
5. Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat. When it is hot rub the cooking surface with a lightly buttered paper towel then lower the heat to medium low. Wait several minutes then place 3 or 4 rounds top side down in the skillet and cook for about 2 minutes. Flip them over and cook on the other side for 3 minutes. Both sides will be touched with brown and a little black; the cakes will have risen a little and their sides will still be moist looking.
6. Turn back over and cook on the first side for another minute or so. Lift out and onto a rack to cool and set for 10 minutes or more before eating. Cook the remaining cakes the same way. (If you have two skillets once you’re comfortable with the timing you can work with both.) Makes about 12 currant dotted round butter rich scones. 3 to 3 1/2 inches across.

instructions, 1. FOR THE FILLING:  Mix all of the ingredients together except the crust and place in a 8 inch deep dish pie plate.  Bake covered in a preheated oven at 375°F for 1/2 hour.  Remove from the oven and pour off the accumulated fat. Make the pie crust and use only 1/2 of the recipe freeze the other half for future use.  Cover with the crust and return to the oven for 45 minutes or until the top crust is golden brown and flaky.
2. Allow to cool completely before serving.
3. This is great for a first course a midnight snack or a luncheon dish.
4. FOR THE BASIC EASY CRUST:  In a medium size bowl stir the flour and salt together.  Cut in the shortenings using a pastry blender.  Keep working the flour and shortening until the mixture is rather grainy like coarse cornmeal.  Mix the egg and vinegar together and using a wooden fork stir the mixture into the flour.  Add enough ice water so that the dough barely holds together.  Place on a marble pastry board or a plastic countertop and knead for just a few turns enough so that the dough holds together and becomes rollable.
5. I roll out my dough on a piece of waxed paper. It is easy to handle that way.   I sprinkle the table with water and then put a piece of waxed paper on top this way the paper does not move around as I am rolling.  If you have a marble rolling it will be even easier.  If you a wooden rolling pin be sure to dust a teaspoon of flour on it a couple of times when you are rolling out the dough.
6. NOTE:  This recipe will make enough dough for one 9-inch pie with two crust top and bottom or two single pie crusts.  Serves 6.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 400&deg;F.
2. Remove the green outer leaves from the cauliflower as well as the thick white stalk taking care not to break off the florets. Cut a deep cross in the bottom of the stem and steam it whole over a pan of boiling water until slightly tender but not cooked through. The cauliflower florets should still be firm.  Remove the cauliflower from the heat and leave to cool.
3. Place the butter in a large saucepan and melt over medium heat. Lower the heat and add the finely chopped leeks.  Cook until the leeks are softening slightly but not cooked thoroughly. Remove 1 tablespoon of the leeks and keep to one side.  Add the flour to the remaining leeks in the pan and stir.  The flour will become lumpy but continue to stir for 2 - 3 minutes.  This will cook the flour and soften it to make a better sauce.  Add the large pinch of salt and the mustard powder and stir again.  Turn up the heat to medium and add the milk all at once.  Stir briskly until a smooth sauce forms.  Continue stirring until the sauce is thick and glossy - about 4 - 5 minutes.  If the sauce thickens too much add a little more milk.  It should be thick but still a bit runny.  At this point add the grated cheese and stir until melted.  Remove from heat.
4. Break or cut the cauliflower florets away from the thick central stalk taking care not to break it into tiny pieces. Place these florets in a greased baking dish large enough to hold all the florets in just one layer.  Pour the cheese and leek sauce over the cauliflower making sure to cover all the florets.  Sprinkle the extra grated cheese evenly over the top and scatter the reserved softened leeks over the top as well.  Finally grate some fresh pepper over the top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and golden brown on the top approximately 20 minutes. Test the cauliflower to make sure it's cooked through by piercing with a sharp pointed knife cook a little longer if necessary.  Serve warm.,

7. -- to sweeten up the meat a bit I add a good squirt of ketchup (there's only one brand - Heinz) and 1/2 can of tomato soup (you probably don't need this if you use pork - but at least try the ketchup).
8. - fill your rolls and roll 'em up -- don't roll too tight - you will be able to tuck in the ends by pushing in with your little finger -- if they're rolled to tight they'll explode in your hand -- or fold over the ends of the leaf when rolling sort of like a round burrito.
9. -- it doesn't take long to do this -- have fun.
10. Now for the artistry:
11. - Line the bottom of your roaster with bacon - roaster should be deep enough to add several layers and hold adequate liquid.
12. - Top the bacon with a good layer of left-over cabbage leaves -- the ones too small to roll or ripped leaves.
13. - layer with sauerkraut.
14. - sprinkle a little caraway seeds.
15. - layer with thickly sliced onion and chopped garlic.
16. - add 6-10 bay leaves depending on the amount.
17. - layer the halupki - alternating direction of layers.
18. -- incorporate 2 - 3 inch lengths of kielbasa throughout.
19. - add remaining tomato soup if used.
20. - add tomatoes and sauce.
21. - salt and pepper.
22. - add cabbage water to cover.
23. Bake at 350 for one hour then reduce heat to 250 for three more hours.
24. -- or reduce heat to 175-200 overnight - check to ensure enough liquid - don't dry them out.
25. Serve with kick-ass mashed potatoes.
26. - roast as much garlic as you would like in the potatoes.
27. Cube potatoes and for best results add sea salt and refrigerate for a few hours.
28. - rinse and drain potatoes cover with water and lightly boil until soft.
29. Mash together with butter canned milk cheddar/freshly grated Parmesan cheese sea salt white pepper roasted garlic jarred diced garlic a little garlic powder and grape seed oil.

instructions, 1. Mix blackening spices together in a shallow dish.
2. Heat a heavy frying pan over medium-high heat. Pat chicken dry (if needed use a mallet and plastic wrap to lightly tenderize achieving an even thickness) and use blackening spice mix to cover both sides of chicken pieces until evenly coated.
3. Place in hot ungreased pan. Cook on each side until spices are blackened and fragrant and chicken is cooked through about 5-6 minutes total. Set chicken aside on a plate and cover to rest.
4. While chicken is cooking bring a large stock pot of salted water to a boil over high heat (optional: add a splash of vegetable oil to reduce clumping and foaming). Cook pasta until Al dente for Artesian about 8 minutes commercial about 12 minutes.
5. While pasta is boiling wipe out frying pan used for chicken. Turn heat to medium and add olive oil and garlic to the pan. Cook garlic until fragrant but not brown 1-2 minutes. Add half-and-half and turn heat down to medium-low. Simmer and reduce about 8-10 minutes.
6. Drain pasta and slice chicken on a bias.
7. To the sauce add sun-dried tomatoes and chicken 1/2c parmesan cheese. Stir until cheese is melted. Add hot noodles to sauce; combine. Plate and top with green onions and more parmesan cheese.

12. -Crushed red pepper flakes.
13. Also pairs well with
14. -Hearty robust herb marinara sauces classic spinach pesto sauces angel hair spaghetti or penne pasta.
15. SUBTITUTES:
16. HALF-AND HALF: substitute every 1 cup Half/Half with 4-1/2 teaspoons soft melted butter plus 1 cup whole milk blend well.
17. ONION: 1 small fresh onion = 1/3 cup freshly minced onion (fresh will not sear like a powder spice; flakes) 1/3 cup freshly minced onion = 1 tablespoon dried onion flakes 1 tablespoon dried onion flakes = 1 teaspoon onion powder.
18. OLIVE OIL: if trading for EVOO use care cooking it’s lower smoking point will not survive high heat.
19. TABLE SALT: use a conservatively lesser amount (Kosher flakes/granules tend to be larger; so by volume 1 teaspoon Kosher contains less crystals and minerals than table salt.  Kosher salt provides a desired salty flavor without as much sodium as table salt).

instructions, 1. Get a pot of water or broth going at a high boil.
2. Mix the milk flour and eggs in a bowl. (The resulting batter should be a little thicker than Duncan Hines cake mix; a tiny bit stiff but definitely not "dough".).
3. With a spoon drop small blobs of batter into the boiling water and let boil for about 20 minutes. (Be advised that you need to keep the water/broth at a high boil for this to work. The surfaces of the blobs really need to cook as soon as they hit the water. then they magically don't stick together. Also be advised that the blobs will expand as they cook so try not to make them very large. One way or another you'll probably have to chop them up with a spatula when you're done anyway.).
4. When Spaetzel is done remove it from the broth.
5. Drop into Chicken Paprikash when it's done.,

2. Grease the bottom and sides of a 9x9x2 cake pan and set aside.
3. Cream the butter sugar and yolks.
4. Fold in flour and walnuts.
5. Divide the batter in half. Do not over handle the dough. One half will serve as the top layer and the other as the bottom.
6. Take a piece of batter and gently flatten it using your fingers. You will see that the batter tends to make its own sections. Work with those. Place this section on the bottom of the cake pan and continue until you have covered the bottom of the cake pan in a patchwork manner. Do not worry about the dough not looking smooth in the pan you will fix that in a minute.
7. If you have leftover dough from the half fill in holes and build up areas that may be thinner than others.
8. Take the back of a spoon and gently smooth the edges of the dough together so no holes are apparent.
9. Spread a thin layer of jam over the dough. Do not make the layer thick you are not making PB and J here.
10. Use the final half of batter to make the top layer using the same technique as above.
11. Place in the oven at 325 degrees for 30-45 minutes. At around 25 minutes start peaking in the oven the dough should be a nice golden brown color when it is finished.

3. Add all other ingredients together with 1/3 - 1/2 cup of water.
4. Cook in pressure cooker for 20 minutes.
5. As I remember (it is not written in my original instructions) I cook the beef in the pressure cooker for 20 minutes and then turn the heat off.  I let the pressure cooker sit for about another 1/2 hour (without releasing the pressure) while I mess with the potatoes.  This probably amounts to about 1 1/2 - 2 hours of "normal" cooking.
6. While cooking boil 3-4 medium potatoes (cut up in about 1 1/2 inch cubes in as little water as possible.  "As little water as possible" means just barely cover the potatoes with water and use a small pot so that they are crowded together.  When both are done add potatoes and the potato water to the stew.  Thicken with flour.
7. * Hungarian paprika is essential here.  Domestic paprika is food coloring.  Hungarian paprika is a SPICE.,

Just a thought :-).,

instructions, 1. Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water.
2. Peel them and immediately mash them. You should have about 1 1/2 cups. Cool.
3. Mix the warm milk with the yeast and sugar. Let the starter sit for 5 or 10 minutes.

5. Put dough in a bowl and cover.
6. Let dough rise in a warm place until double in bulk. About 1 hour.
7. Roll out the dough with a floured rolling pin on a floured board to 1/2 inch thick.

9. Melt Lard in a frying pan so it is at least 1/2 deep.
10. Fry Langos over medium heat. If the lard is too hot they will burn if the lard is to cool the Langos will absorb too much lard. You will have to watch them. Let them get a nice tanish/brown color.
11. When they are done rub each Langos with a cut clove of garlic and sprinkle with salt both sides.
12. Serve warm. (Good to accompany with a cold beer).,

instructions, 1. Chop the onions finely. Put a little canola oil in a pan turn the heat to medium. When the oil is hot add the onions and a pinch of salt turn down the heat to low-medium and saute covered for about 10 mins until yellow and soft. Simmer from time to time.
2. Remove the onions from the pan and put on a bowl to cool down.
3. Grate the carrot using the coarse side of the grater. Squeeze well between your palms afterwards to get rid of all the water.
4. Grate the potatoes using the fine side of the grater. Squeeze well between your palms afterwards.
5. Dunk the slices of bread (crust removed) in a little milk for 3 seconds and then squeeze well between palms to get rid of all the liquid.
6. Mince the garlic cloves (you can remove the germs if you wish - in this way the garlic smell won't stay with you 2 days afterwards).
7. Remove the leaves from the parsley and dill and finely chop them.
8. Put the minced meat potatoes carrot eggs garlic onion bread slices dill parsley bread crumbs pepper in a large bowl. Mix everything together (with your hands or mixer). Add 1/2 Tbs salt mix and taste the composition. Add another 1/2 Tbs salt if you think it's needed. I normally put 1 Tbsp salt in total. Also of course you can add more pepper if you like it more spicy.
9. Press the mixture against the pan and 'pat' it slightly with you hands to look uniform. Then cover the bowl and let the mixture rest in the fridge for 1 hour. This will firm up the mixture.
10. Remove the mixture from the fridge 20 minutes before cooking.
11. Take 1 heaped Tblsp of mixture at a time and with your hands wet form the meatballs. Place the meatballs on a plate.
12. In a deep medium sized frying pan put canola oil until it's about 1.5 inches in height. Let the oil heat up on a medium-high heat. It's important that the pan is not too wide so that the oil inside is quite deep in order to cover  the meatballs well from all sides when cooking.
13. When the oil is hot turn down the heat to medium and put the meatballs in the pan. Fry on one side for 4 mins then turn on the other side fry for 4 mins then 1 min again on each side.
14. Remove the meatballs from the pan and place on a paper towel to absorb the oil.

instructions, 1. Using a sharp paring knife do your best to cut the core out of the cabbage.  Rinse it off well.  Place in a large dutch oven core side down with about 2" of water on the bottom place the lid on the pot and turn on to medium heat.  When the lid is hot turn heat down to low or med. low.  While waiting for the pot to heat put the meat mixture together.
2. You'll need a large bowl to mix it.  Remove the casings from the bratwurst and put the raw ground meat into the bowl.  Add the ground round.  Finely mince the garlic an and chop the onion and add to mixture.  Add the rice beer and salt & pepper to taste.  Mix thoroughly.
3. As cabbage steams remove each outer leaf when it becomes pliable and just begins to change color.  Do NOT let it get completely cooked. You can remove leaves almost all the way down to the core but stop once they are no longer at least 3 inches in diameter.  Stack the leaves curved-side down on a plate.
4. Now comes the time to wrap the meat in the cabbage leaves.  How much meat mixture you use depends upon the size of the leaves.  You'll want to be able to roll your ball of meat completely half-way up the leave turn the sides of the leave in then roll the rest of the way up the leaf.  As each roll is done place it in the bottom of your dutch oven.  Usually 2 lbs of meat is about right to stuff the leaves of one large cabbage.  Just keep aligning your cabbage rolls in the pan stacking them but not above the top of the pan unless you have a dome lid for your dutch oven.  When all rolls are in the pan empty the jar of sauerkraut (or tomatoes) over the top of the rolls.  Add about 2/3 jar full of water or 2-1/2 to 3 cups.  Put the lid on your dutch oven and place over medium heat.  Once again when the lid becomes hot and you can see steam escaping turn the heat down to low.  Do not remove the lid while cooking.  It will take approximately 2-1/2 hours to complete the cooking; the cabbage needs to be fork-tender and the rice of course needs to be completely done.

2. Meanwhile mix flour and next 3 ingredients.  Dredge the chicken breasts through the flour mixture.  Place in the skillet with the vegetables pushing them up against the side so the chicken will brown.  Cook 3 to 4 minutes on each side or until golden brown.  Add water and chicken bouillon granules.  Heat to a boil then reduce to low and cover for 1 hour.

Make up 12 palacsinta and fill with the minced meat tucking in the ends. Arrange in an ovenproof dish and pour the paprika and sour cream sauce over the pancakes. Heat through in the oven sprinkle with sour cream and serve decorated with parsley.
2. For variation: You can substitute slices of ham for the veal meat.  In this case you will rap slices of cooked ham inside the pancake (Palacsinta) and make the stew out of boiled potatoes.  Saute the onions in 1 tablespoon of fat.  Boil about 3 medium white potatoes. Mash the potatoes; add the sour cream sauteed onions salt and pepper.

instructions, 1. Parboil rice and mix with pork beef spices salt and pepper.  Choose well formed peppers.  Cut off tops of peppers wash and seed.  Tops taken off in rings can be used as "bases" for any peppers that do not sit well in the pot.  Stuff peppers tightly with meat mixture.  Set peppers aside.  Roll any left over meat into meat balls.
2. In a large heavy pot a 4 quart or greater dutch oven works well make a light roux by melting the butter and stirring in the flour.  Stir and cook flour until lightly browned.  Sir in tomato juice.  Add peppers to pot making certain they are submerged or at least well doused with the sauce.  (Add any meat balls to pot.).
3. Bring to a bubbling simmer and cook 2-3 hours stirring occasionally to be sure peppers don't burn on the bottom.  Serve with crusty bread and if you want a dollop of sour cream.  These are very good made a day ahead and they freeze very well.  (We often find we have a great deal of sauce left over and if anyone can come up with a use for it please let me know.).,

instructions, 1. In a stock pot or dutch oven saute onions in butter until tender.
2. Add water until pot is about 1/3 full.
3. Add chicken thighs garlic powder salt pepper and paprika.
4. Make sure water is covering the chicken if not add more until it just covers.
5. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 90 minutes covered stirring occasionally.
6. In the meantime make the dumplings: Mix the flour salt pepper and paprika in a medium bowl until combined.
7. Make a well in the center and drop in the egg and about 1/2 cup water.
8. Stir and add more water by the tablespoon until you have a sticky dough that just leaves the side of the bowl.
9. In a different large pot from chicken boil water.
10. Drop dumpling mixture by the teaspoon into the boiling water.
11. (I use a regular teaspoon from my flatware not a measuring spoon.) If dumpling mix is too sticky to drop from spoon then dip the spoon into the boiling water the dumpling should slide right off.
12. When dumplings start floating on top remove them with a slotted spoon or drain them.
13. You may have to reduce the heat to see when they are floating.
14. About 30 minutes before chicken should be done add the dumplings to the pot with the chicken.
15. After 30 minutes you should have a delicious dish: the chicken should be tender enough that it is falling off of the bone and the dumplings should have made a thicker sauce out of the liquid the chicken was cooking inches.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven temperature to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
2. BREAD MACHINE: Put the milk water egg flour salt sugar 1 oz butter and the yeast into your machine and select dough normal. This will mix knead and prove the dough and takes about an hour and a half depending on your machine.
3. BY HAND: Put the egg flour salt sugar 1 oz butter and the yeast  in a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon slowly mix in the warm milk and the warm water until the mixture forms into a pliable dough. Cover and put the dough in a warm place until it has nearly doubled in size.
4. BUTTER DOUGH: Place the dough (both from the bread machine and by hand) on a floured surface and knead well until it feels elastic.Return the dough to the bowl cover and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Return the chilled dough to your floured work surface and roll it into a rectangular shape around 50cm X 20cm - 20" X 8".
5. Separate the remaining butter into 3 portions and then using one third of the butter dot the butter over the upper two thirds of the rolled dough keeping a 1cm/1/2" border around the edges. Fold the dough into three  bringing up the bottom unbuttered part of the dough and then folding the top buttered part of the dough over.

Then take your rolling pin and press the dough at intervals to seal the dough and create air pockets. Roll out into a rectangle again the same size and then continue as before two more times until your butter is used up - please see photos as a guide. It is important to return the rolled dough to the fridge in between each rolling to ensure the butter does not melt and the dough does not become too sticky. After the last rolling when all the butter is used return the dough to the refrigerator to chill for a further 30 minutes.

cuisine, European >> Eastern European >> Hungarian, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. METHOD: In a heavy straight-sided sauté pan or a casserole (like a Dutch Oven) melt three generous tablespoons of delicious lard.
2. Prepare all peppers core devein and cut into 4-6 long narrow wedges.
3. Cut onions into ½ moon slices. Place onions and peppers into the lard on high heat. Stir-fry until it becomes like a stew cooked but still firm; only about 6-8 minutes - no longer you want the integrity of the peppers to remain in tact and the bright colours to stay. Then add all seasonings stewed tomatoes and paste.
4. Adding the Hungarian Sausage: Take 1 pair of Hungarian Kolbász (Sausage) and slice it on the “diagonal” – the visual effect is important. You can add the slices right into the pepper stew and let it stew together if it’s not too dry. Other sausage variations like Debrecen are ideal but the drier ones like the Gyulai sausage are exceptionally delicious. Note: if the sausage is too dry – stew beforehand in ½ cup water in a shallow saucepan for 10-15 minutes before adding it to the peppers. (Add both stewing liquid and sausage to the peppers).
5. Let simmer until all flavours are melded; about 4-6 minutes.  Warning – when you are stirring use a wooden slotted spoon so as not to break up the peppers – you are not going for baby food!
6. Serving Suggestions:  Serve with fluffy white jasmine rice and/or fresh Hungarian white bread. You can jazz it up or play it down.  However you use it you will find it to be very complimentary with a variety of your favourite dishes.,

instructions, 1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position; heat the oven to 375°F In a small bowl beat the egg yolk cream and vanilla with a fork until combined; set aside.
2. In a standing mixer cream the butter sugar and salt at medium-high speed until light and fluffy 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula. With the mixer running at medium speed add the yolk-cream mixture and beat until incorporated about 30 seconds. Scrape down the bowl. With the mixer running at low speed gradually beat in the flour until combined. Scrape down the bowl and give a final stir with the rubber spatula to ensure that no flour pockets remain.
3. If using a cookie press to form the cookies follow the manufacturer’s instructions to fill the press; if using a pastry bag (see TECHNIQUE below). Press or pipe cookies onto ungreased baking sheets spacing them about 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake one sheet at a time until the cookies are light golden brown 10 to 12 minutes rotating the baking sheet halfway through the baking time.  Cool the cookies on the baking sheet until just warm 10 to 15 minutes; using a metal spatula transfer them to a wire rack and cool to room temperature.
4. FOR LEMON SPRITZ COOKIES: Follow the recipe for Spritz Cookies adding 1 teaspoon lemon juice to the yolk-cream mixture in step 1 and adding 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest to the butter along with the sugar and salt in step 2.
5. FOR ALMOND SPRITZ COOKIES: Grind ½ cup sliced almonds and 2 tablespoons of the flour called for in Spritz Cookies in a food processor until powdery and evenly fine about 1 minute; combine the almond mixture with the remaining flour. Follow the recipe for Spritz Cookies substituting 3/4 teaspoon almond extract for the vanilla.
6. TECHNIQUE: Filling a Pastry Bag: (1) Make a C shape with one hand and hold the piping bag. Fold the bag over that hand about halfway down insert the tip and scrape the dough into the bag.  (2) When the bag is about half full pull up the sides push down the dough and twist tightly while again pushing down on the dough to squeeze out any air.  (3) Grab the bag at the base of the twist. Using the other hand as a guide hold the top at a 90-degree angle about 1/2-inch above the baking sheet and squeeze to form the shape.,

Beat for about 30 seconds or until well combined (dough will pull away from the sides of the bowl).
2. Roll the dough into 1" balls and place in an UNgreased miniature cupcake pan. Find something in your kitchen that is the same diameter as the cupcake hole (I used a shot glass) and press gently down on each ball to make an indentation.
3. Place a rounded half teaspoon of raspberry jam in each depression and bake at 350F for 20 minutes. The jam will melt and spread out evently.
4. Keep the baked cookies IN the pan but on a cooling rack for TEN MINUTES. After 10 minutes you will be able to VERY GENTLY lift the cookie cups out of the pan. You can use the tip of a knife to help but it shouldn't be necessary -- just lift with a steady gentle pressure and they will pop out. I've also had luck turning the pan upside down on a soft towel and tapping it gently -- they should pop out.,

2. Preheat oven to 375º.
3. Use butter or cooking spray to lightly grease 2" Sandbakkels tins.
4. Cream together the butter and sugar.
5. Mix in the well-beaten egg followed by 2 cups of flour and 1 teaspoons of flavoring.

7. With floured fingers pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoons of dough.
8. Roll into a ball press into a tin and use your thumbs to press the dough out to cover the bottom and sides of the tin in a thin layer (Tip: This dough is forgiving and as pliant as play dough. If you haven’t pinched off enough dough to line the tin simply add more. If you pinched too much use your finger to scrape off the excess that pushes up past the top of the tin adding it back to the remaining dough).
9. Repeat.

cuisine, European >> Scandinavian >> Swedish, 
time, ,

instructions, 1. NOTE: Removing hot baked custard from a hot water bath is hard! Make it easy on yourself by using a canning jar lifter with rubber grips! They are easy to find in thrift stores at your grandmothers or at Target for less than $7.00. If you bake a lot of custard or can this tool is indespensible!
2. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Fill tea kettle with enough water to fill a 9" x 13" pan half way up with boiling water. Bring water to boil then turn down heat. Butter the custard cups; mine hold 5 ounces of custard or between 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup custard and yields five custard cups.  Place buttered custard cups into the 9" x 13" empty pan set aside.
3. Place the 2.5 cups of milk in a large saucepan uncovered over medium heat. Let the milk stand in the pan without stirring until a skin forms on top and it is scalded. Or if this makes you uneasy stir the milk and continue heating until small bubbles form along the edges of the pan. Remove from heat.
4. Meanwhile place the eggs and yolks in a large mixing container with a pouring spout. Beat or whisk briefly only to mix not until they are foamy or light. (This beats too much air into the custard)
5. Gradually add the sugar vanilla and almond extracts and salt beating only until well mixed.
6. Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup slowly add 1/4 cup amounts of the hot milk to the egg mixture stirring gently. When 1 cup of warm milk has been added into the egg mixture add the remaining milk and stir gently. This process is called "tempering" making sure that your eggs don't "scramble" in the pan from the heat of the milk!
7. Strain the mixture into a measuring cup large enough to hold 4 cups of liquid. Straining removes any lumpy egg whites and bubbles from beating.  Pour 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup custard mixture into the custard cups set into the pan. Shake the smallest amount of nutmeg over each top only to decorate and provide a hint of nutmeg.
8. Make sure that the tea kettle's water is HOT!  Place pan with custard cups into the oven and carefully pour the hot boiling water into the pan going up to 1/2 of the height of the custard cups.
9. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes until a sharp knife inserted 1 inch into the middle of the custard comes out clean.  Carefully remove the pan and place on a heat-proof surface.  Using a jar lifter lift each cup of custard out of the hot water and place on a wire rack to cool. Allow water in pan to cool dump out.
10. Serve warm cool cold. Plain or with topping of choice. Just enjoy it however you please!,

3. Chop a handful of dill roughly and place 1/4 of it in the dish to form a bed for the salmon to sit on.
4. Take the two equal size pieces of salmon and wash over the sink with the dark liquor. Pat to dry and place aside.
5. Using half of the dry mix rub the mix into one salmon piece to cover all sides. Use the remaining dry mix for the other salmon piece.
6. Place the first salmon piece skin down on the bed of dill. Place more dill on top and around the sides.
7. Place the second salmon piece (skin up) on top of the first piece to form a salmon sandwich with dill in between and all around both pieces.
8. Wrap tightly with the aluminum foil previously laid over the dish.
9. Place dish in the fridge with a heavy-ish cookbook on top of the wrapped up salmon. Make sure it will evenly distribute its weight over the packed salmon. This is to squeeze the liquid out of the salmon.
10. Wait two days drain any liquid out of the dish flip the salmon pack over and place back in the fridge with the book on top.
11. Wait another 2 days and voila! You now have gravlax ready to serve. Slice it thinly with a fillet knife (check youtube for technique).
12. To prepare the mustard dill sauce: Take all ingredients (except olive oil and dill) and whisk together in a bowl. Put olive oil in a container suitable for slowly pouring into the mixture. While whisking slowing pour in olive oil to ensure it mixes well. Keep whisking. Add the finely chopped dill into the mixture (ensuring there are no stems in the dill). All done!,

instructions, 1. Ask the butcher to split a few marrowbones lengthwise and extract the marrow For you. Have the beef pork and veal ground together in front of you for unless you see it you cannot be sure that it will be free of fat.
2. So that they can be chilled prepare the meat balls at least an hour before you plan to cook them. They are less likely then to crumble and lose their shape when they are fried.
3. Soak the crumbs in the four Tab. of cream for 5 minutes then put them in a large mixing bowl with the marrow and ground meats.
4. Melt the 2 T. butter in a small frying pan and in it cook the chopped onion shallots and garlic over Moderate heat for 5 min.or until softened and color lightly. Add them to the mixing bowl and at the same time add the grated lemon rind parsley salt pepper and thyme.
5. Beat the 2 eggs lightly with a fork and pour them over the meat. With a large spoon beat this mixture vigorously until the ingredients are thoroughly combined and the meat loses its granular texture. If you own an electric mixer with a dough hook attachment the beating operation will be much easier. But do not attempt to use an ordinary beater attachment; it will not work.
6. Form into small balls about an inch in diameter. The simplest and most efficient way to do this is to place a heaping teaspoon of the meat in the palm of of one hand and after moistening the other hand with cold water roll it lightly over the meat until you have shaped it into a sphere. Do not fuss with this too much; when the balls are chilled you can reshape them easily if you wish.
7. Place the meat balls as you finish them on a baking sheet or platter lined with wax paper. Cover them with another sheet of waxed paper and chill for at least an hour. For more firmly crusted meatballs roll each lightly in flour just before frying them.
8. When you are ready to cook the meatballs melt the 3 Tab. butter and 2 Tab. oil over high heat in a large heavy frying pan. When the fat begins to sputter lightly drop into the pan enough meat balls to cover the bottom about three quarters full. At once slide the pan back and forth over the burner so that they roll around in the hot fat; this will help them to keep their shapes and to brown evenly.
9. After a couple of minutes turn the heat down to moderate and cook the balls 6-7 minutes longer or until they are crisp brown all over and cooked through. Make sure by breaking one open; there should not be the slightest indication of pink in the center. With a slotted spoon transfer the finished meatballs to a shallow casserole and continue with the remaining meatballs until they are all cooked.
10. Make the sauce in the same frying pan. If the fat remaining in it is a good deep brown; pour off all but 3 Tab. of it. If however it is black and badly burned scrape it all out and in its place melt 3 T. butter.
11. Off the heat with a wooden spoon stir into the pan 2 Tab of flour and mix it to a smooth paste with the fat. Return the pan to a low heat and cook this roux slowly for a minute of so stirring all the while. Then pour in all at once the cup of stock. Raise the heat to moderate and with a wire whisk beat this sauce together until it boils thickens and becomes quite smooth. Then turn the heat down to the barest simmer. Still using the whisk stir the sour cream into the sauce about a Tab. at a time. Use more than ½ cup if you like the sauce fairly thin. At the last add the fresh dill lemon juice salt to taste and cayenne. Pour the sauce over the meatballs in the casserole.
12. When you are ready to serve them reheat the meatballs slowly without letting the sauce boil.
13. Serve them directly from the casserole sprinkled with a little extra fresh dill if you have it. Buttered rice noodles or pasta of any kind go well with this.
14. Note: If you are unable to get any marrow in its place beat into the meat ball mixture 3 tab. soft butter.,

instructions, 1. Butter a 10 X 15 inch jelly roll pan. Line with parchment paper and butter that as well. Preheat oven to 370°F.
2. In a mixer (a hand mixer and sturdy deep bowl work as well) beat the eggs until they are very thick and light colored (this takes about 7 minutes). Continue beating and add the sugar in 1 tablespoon at a time allowing each spoonful to mix in before continuing with the next. Beat in the vanilla as well.
3. Stop the mixer and sift 1/2 cup cake flour on top of the batter. Using a spatula gently stir the flour into the batter. Sift the final 1/2 cup flour on top and then very gently fold this into the batter. You want to stop as soon as all the flour is integrated into the batter. This will give you a lovely airy cake.
4. Pour and spread the batter into the prepared pan and bake for just 10 minutes. Do not overbake or the cake will be too stiff to roll without breaking.
5. As soon as you take it out of the oven turn the cake out onto a clean dishtowel (I’ve seen people recommend that you put powdered sugar on the dishtowel so that it doesn’t stick but I don’t find this necessary). Remove the parchment paper and allow the cake to cool for a couple of minutes. While it is still warm roll the cake up from one of its short ends with the dishtowel inside (this way the cake gets used to being rolled and won’t tear when you fill it and roll it back up). Allow the cake to cool completely.
6. Unroll the cake and spread about 1/2 of the chocolate buttercream (recipe below) evenly on top. Carefully roll the cake back up and neatly place on your serving dish.
7. Chocolate Buttercream: Cream the butter in a small bowl.
8. Blend in the cocoa powder (the amount desired for a light medium or dark flavor) vanilla confectioners sugar alternately with the cream.
9. Beat with an electric mixer until the desired texture is achieved.
10. Optional: To enhance the yule log effect cut off the ends at an angle and use these to create stubs on the log (they’re supposed to look like cut off branches) attaching them with some buttercream.
11. Frost the outside of the log and using a fork trace irregular lines in the frosting to give it a woody effect. Cover the cake carefully with plastic wrap and allow it to “age” in the refrigerator for several hours.,

12. Whether or not your waffle iron’s grids are well seasoned or made of a nonstick material it is best to lightly butter or spray the grids for these waffles because the batter is quite sticky.
13. Brush or spray the grids again only if subsequent waffles stick.
14. Spoon out 2/3 to 3/4 cup of batter for a Belgian waffle iron (or the amount recommended by the manufacturer’s instructions) onto the hot iron.
15. Use a metal spatula or wooden spoon to spread the batter evenly over the grids. Close the lid and bake until golden.
16. If the waffle is hard to remove from the iron peel it off gently and carefully. Serve immediately or keep the waffles in a single layer on a rack in the preheated oven while you make the rest.
17. Serving: Serve these warm and golden one to a diner topped with vanilla ice cream and maple syrup. They’re great with a cup of hot or cold cider.,

instructions, 1. Place yeast milk and water into the workbowl of a stand mixer. Stir for a few seconds to moisten the yeast.
2. Add the egg and 1/3 of the total flour. Mix to blend. Scrape down sides of bowl.
3. Sprinkle remaining flour over the mixture but do not stir it inches Cover and let stand 75-90 minutes (at the end of that time you’ll notice the batter bubbling up through the cover of flour).
4. Add brown sugar salt and baking powder* ( * while baking powder is not a traditional ingredient it provides a slightly more modern texture. If you like omit the baking powder and add 1/2 teaspoons more yeast.) to the workbowl of a stand mixer. Mix on low speed – just to blend.
5. With machine on low add honey and vanilla. Then add 2 tablespoons of butter at a time. Mix 4 minutes at medium-low speed; scrape down sides once or twice in that period. Let the dough rest for 1 minute and then continue to mix for 2 minutes. If you measured your ingredients perfectly the dough will be sticking to the sides of the bowl in the last minute of mixing and then in the last 30 seconds of so will start to ball-up on the paddle. If this does not happen let the dough rest for 1 more minute and mix for another 2 minutes. Whatever the outcome of the extra mixing proceed to Step 6.
6. Scrape the dough into a large bowl sprinkle lightly with flour cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for 4 hours. This step is crucial for developing the flavor.
7. REFRIGERATE FOR 30 MINUTES BEFORE PROCEEDING TO STEP #8. This is essential. The yeast respiration must be slowed before continuing.
8. Stir the dough down (meaning: gently deflate the gases from the dough by pressing on it with a rubber spatula) scrape it onto a piece of plastic wrap and then use the spatula to press the dough into a long rectangle. Fold that rectangle over on itself (by thirds – like a letter) so that you have a square of dough. Wrap it in plastic weigh it down a bit (I put two heavy dinner plates on top of it) and refrigerate overnight.
9. The next day place the cold dough (it will be quite firm) in a large bowl and add all of the pearl sugar to a bowl. It will seem like a lot of sugar but it’s supposed to be :) Mix it into the dough by hand until the chunks are well-distrubuted. Once mixed divide the dough into 5 pieces of equal size.
10. Shape each chunk into an oval ball (like a football without the pointy ends) and let it rise (covered loosely in plastic wrap) for exactly 90 minutes.
11. If you have a professional waffle iron (meaning: it’s cast iron and weighs over 20 pounds) cook at exactly 365-370 degrees (the max temp before sugar begins to burn/decompose) for approximately 2 minutes.** Give each waffle a few minutes to cool slightly before eating. No syrup or toppings are needed unless you’d like to add some fruit or a dusting of powdered sugar; they’re quite sweet on their own.
12. If you have a regular waffle iron heat the iron to 420 degrees (hint: many regular waffle irons go up to and over 550 degrees at their highest setting)  place the dough on the iron and immediately unplug it or turn the temp dial all the way down. Otherwise the sugar will burn.,

instructions, 1. Cook the chicken breasts or the chicken in the chicken stock until tender (breasts should take about 30 minutes a whole chicken 45 minutes or more). Drain but keep the stock. Let the chicken cool down a bit.
2. In the meanwhile make tiny meatballs (max. 1 cm across) from the minced meat. Cook the meatballs in chicken stock or water until they are done -- this usually takes just a few minutes the meatballs will drift to the top when ready. Drain them as well.
3. Make a "blonde" sauce: melt most of the butter in a medium-sized pot (don't let it become brown) add flour and mix well. Keep the pot on medium heat. Then very gradually add splashes (think 2-3 tablespoons) of chicken stock to this mixture. Each time you added some stock stir very well so that the mixture doesn't become lumpy. You can start adding increasing amounts of stock when your sauce becomes liquidish. Make a sauce that is somewhat thicker than cream; you will probably use most of your chicken stock in this process. This is fine.
4. Quickly add the raw egg yolk the lemon juice and the grated cheese to your sauce.
5. In a large pot melt the remaining lump of butter and add the mushrooms. Stir-fry the mushrooms on medium heat until they start to "sweat" (release their juices). Season with salt and pepper.
6. Add the sauce and the ham dices to the mushrooms. Add the meatballs as well. Put on low heat.
7. With your hands or a knife pull apart the chicken and make bite-sized pieces (about 1 inch long 1/2 inch across or smaller). Add the chicken pieces to your mixture as well.
8. Ready! Do check if the dish needs a bit more salt or pepper. You can eat the Vol-Au-Vent as it is with potatoes or rices; you can also pour it in Vol-Au-Vent shells (puff pastry) or even make a chicken fricassee pie (in a puff pastry pie shell).,

instructions, 1. Set oven at 325 deg F/ 160 deg Celsius.
2. Thinly slice off the discoloured end of the endives.
3. Cut each endive in two lengthwise. If any leaves fall away gather them and use them when wrapping in the bacon strips.
4. Season each endive half well with ground nutmeg and white pepper. It is fine just to season the cut halves because they fall apart easily when handled.
5. Wrap each halved endive in one or two slices of bacon with a fatty rind -- you need that. Depending on the width of your bacon you might need only 1 slice. I used "back bacon" which has a lean part with a fatty edge.
6. Put the bacon-wrapped endive halves in an oven dish and spoon in the balsamic vinegar.
7. Drizzle each wrapped half with drops of olive oil and put a piece of foil loosely over the dish.
8. Put in the pre-heated oven. After 15 mins remove the foil and bake another 30 minutes.
9. While they're baking roughly crumble the blue cheese in chunks.
10. Take the dish from the oven divide the crumbled blue cheese among the 6 endive halves and bake another 5 minutes or until the cheese starts collapsing and melting.
11. Serve as a side dish with a simple chicken dish a carb like basmati rice and some sweetish veggie like butternut or sweet potatoes. The sweetish side dish complements the salty endives.
12. The endives will still be slightly crunchy.,

instructions, 1. 1. Turn on your Belgian/regular waffle maker. Spray waffle iron with cooking spray for first waffle but you shouldn't need oil after the first waffle.
2. 2.  In a medium bowl mix together flours baking powder and salt.  Then cut in margarine with a pastry cutter until mixture resembles a crumbly meal.  (Butter pieces should be smaller than peas.).
3. 3.  In another bowl mash banana and add the milk and sugar then mash more. Add the extracts and keep mash/mixing. Add the applesauce and mix thoroughly. (If you like your waffles to be really light on the inside forget the applesauce.).
4. 3. Add the wet mixture to the dry. The batter should be kind of chunky like thick pancake batter or muffin batter. If you feel it seems too dry add more milk. I usually add a splash at this stage.
5. 4. Ladle batter onto waffle iron starting in the middle about 3 big spoonfuls. Don't try to spread it out just slop it on and the waffle maker will take care of the rest. Your waffle maker may have a light that indicates when they're done.  Mine takes about 2-and-a-half minutes.
6. They should come out nice and crispy on the outside and have the consistency of a popover on the inside not at all like pancakes not thick not doughy.,

instructions, 1. Shell the shrimp and reserve the shells. Chop the shrimp into 1/4-inch dice.
2. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium-size  saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook stirring until translucent but not browned 2 to 3 minutes. Add the shrimp shells and cook for 2 more minutes. Add 1-3/4 cups milk and the bay leaf and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes.
3. Strain the broth through a sieve and discard the solids. Return the broth to the saucepan and heat over low heat. Add the shrimp and poach for 3 minutes. Drain the shrimp and reserve the broth. You should have 1-1/2 cups of broth left.
4. In a small saucepan sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water. Let stand while you prepare the béchamel sauce.
5. Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a medium-sized saucepan over low heat. Stir in the flour with a wooden spoon. Switch to a whisk and gradually whisk in the reserved broth. Bring almost to a boil then reduce heat and simmer stirring occasionally until the sauce is smooth and thick about 7 minutes. Add the grated cheese and bring to almost a boil again.
6. Heat the gelatin mixture over low heat until the gelatin has melted 1 to 2 minutes. Stir it into the béchamel sauce and mix well.
7. Remove the sauce from the heat and let cool for a few minutes. Whisk the egg yolk and remaining 5 tablespoons milk together then stir it into the béchamel. Stir in the shrimp lemon juice salt pepper nutmeg and cayenne.
8. Line a 9-inch-square cake pan with plastic wrap. Pour in the shrimp mixture and smooth with a spatula. Press plastic wrap directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate at least overnight or up to 3 days.
9. Prepare the coating: In a medium-size bowl beat the egg whites with the salt and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil just until frothy. Put the flour and bread crumbs into separate shallow bowls ready for dipping.
10. Unmold the firm shrimp mixture onto a lightly floured surface. Cut into 3 x 1-1/2-inch rectangles and roll each rectangle into a cylinder for croquettes. For smaller hors d’oeuvres cut each rectangle in half and roll into a ball.
11. Arrange the three bowls in order -- flour then egg whites then bread crumbs -- and coat the croquettes one at a time: Dust each cylinder or ball lightly with flour dip into the egg white mixture and coat with the bread crumbs. Cover and refrigerate until ready to fry. (At the point the croquettes can wait several days in the refrigerator or longer in the freezer. Thaw in the refrigerator before frying.).
12. Preheat the oven to 250°F.
13. Heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a deep fryer to 375°F Fry the croquettes a few at a time until they turn a rich golden color about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm in the over until ready to serve.
14. Serve the little walnut-size fritters as hors d’oeuvres with a supply of toothpicks. The larger croquettes traditionally are serve on a plate decorated with Boston lettuce leaves lemon wedges and Fried Parsley (see below).
15. Deep Fried Parsley: (“Very crisp and utterly delicious” according to Ruth. Traditionally served with cheese or shrimp croquettes and as a garnish for fish dishes.) Rinse two cups curly parsley leaves (stems removed) under cold running water. Spin dry and roll in a clean dish towel to dry completely. Heat oil in a deep fryer or wok to 375°. Add the parsley and fry until crisp but not brown about 20 seconds. Remove with a skimmer and drain on paper towels.,

instructions, 1. Asparagus: Trim the woody ends off the asparagus spears. One of the best ways to cook asparagus is to steam it upright in a small amount of water; this way the delicate tips of the stalks will cook at the same rate as the thick bottoms. Use a tall lidded pot or a double boiler (invert the upper portion over the lower). There are also special asparagus cookers designed for this purpose. Or you can lay the stalks flat in a collapsible vegetable steamer placed in a large skillet.
2. To handle the asparagus easily tie the spears into bundles of 10 with kitchen string. Add 2" of water to the pot bring to a rapid boil then cover. (You can add a clove of garlic a slice of onion or a lemon wedge to the water.) Cooking time: five to eight minutes depending on the thickness of the spears.
3. Hollandaise sauce:  Melt the butter slowly in a medium-sized saucepan. Once the butter has melted remove the pan from the heat and leave to one side.
4. In a small mixing bowl whisk together the egg yolks.
5. Whilst continuing to whisk add the lemon juice salt and pepper to the beaten egg yolks.
6. Next very slowly to begin with whisk in the melted butter and the 2 tbsp of water. Continue to whisk constantly.
7. Return the mixture to the saucepan heat over a very low heat still whisking all the time until the sauce thickens.
8. Serve immediately or keep warm for up to 30 minutes before serving.
9. Arrange the asparagus spears on a plate - add a knob of butter to them and serve the little Hollandaise sauce in individual bowls for dipping. You can add fresh violets and a lemon wedge if you wish. Serve with crusty bread and chilled white wine. These amounts serve 4 people as a starter and 2 to 3 people as a main meal.,

instructions, 1. you will need an open (no lid) deep fryer  if you only have the kind with filters and lids  just don't close them the steam has to be able to leave very fast else you loose crunchiness.
2. Peel your potatoes  and cut them lengthwise into discs of about 1/4 inch thick (they can be a bit thicker if you like that) . Then slice the discs lengthwise into fries of the same thickness.
3. Make sure your sink is clean  and wash your fries in cold water . Drain the water  and wash them again in new clean water. Repeat this a few times until no starch comes off the potatoes and the water stays clear. Dry your fries well  so there is no more moisture on their sides.
4. First cooking . Put the thermostat for your oil to approximately 320°F or 160°C  not higher . Put a small to medium amount of fries in the cooking basket ( you will have to do this multiple times  if you put in too much fries at once you will loose your temperature and your fries will turn out horrible) . Make sure all fries are under by shaking the basket . During cooking you can shake the basket a few times so you know they're not sticking together. Important: To check if the first cooking is done lift your basket out and pinch a fry if you can pinch all the way through they are done (if you do it fast you will certainly not burn your fingers ) they should still look pale and white  stay with your cooking for this  timing is important.(repeat until they are all done  and let your fat heat up to the appropriate temperature each time).
5. Take out the fries  shake them and put them in a big bowl to cool off  once they are cooled to room temperature they are ok to start the second cooking . you can keep these at room temperature for hours until you are ready to serve the meal  in fact leaving them a bit will only make them better  just put a towel over the bowl  no need to put them in the fridge(where condensationwould coat them).
6. Second cooking. Put the thermostat of your oil at approximately 370°F-374°F or 185°C-190°C  this is usually the highest setting  or just below that . Put a _small_ amount of the precooked fries in your basket . fry them while shaking the basket in the oil a few times during cooking  you can even take the basket out a few times to throw  them in the air (not really needed  but supposed to be good tor making bubbles appear on them :) . They are ready when they are a rich golden brown in color . I put them in a deep plate with a paper towel at the bottom  and use a paper towel to quickly rub the excess fat off them before i serve(paper towel on top hand on paper towel  make a circular movement  take out towel). add a bit of fine salt  and serve. best with a T bone steak or sirloin *grinn* but as you know  fries go with just about anything :).
7. A bit of added history : The French will be the first to say that "les frites" come from Belgium. And it being true that Belgians have made and perfected the stuff for years and years the origin of deep frying potatoes in oil comes from a monastery in Spain.
8. Smakelijk (bon appétit).
9. EDIT:
10. Recently I found out that Bintje potatoes have become commonly available in the United States . These are without a doubt the best potatoes to use.,

instructions, 1. Place a rack in the bottom third of the oven. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Prepare the Mushroom-Flavored Forcemeat. (See separate recipe.).
3. Stuff the turkey with forcemeat and truss with kitchen string. Spread the softened butter evenly over the turkey. Season with salt pepper and paprika. Bake any leftover stuffing in a small casserole just like meat loaf.
4. Spread the carrots celery and onion the bottom of a flameproof roasting pan large enough to hold the turkey. Place the turkey on top of the vegetables. Add the neck and giblets and pour the reserved soaking liquid from the porcini mushrooms (see Forcemeat recipe) into the pan.
5. Roast the turkey for 1 hour. Reduce the heat to 300°F and roast until cooked through 2-1/2 hours or more for a 12–14 pound turkey. An instant-read thermometer should register between 160 to 180°F when thrust into the thickest part of the thigh without touching the bone. Baste the turkey every 15 minutes the entire time that it is roasting. Baste with drippings alternating with the melted butter. If necessary add 1 cup water or chicken broth to the drippings in the bottom of the pan. If the turkey starts to get too brown cover loosely with aluminum foil. Remove the foil for the last 20 minutes to crisp the skin.
6. Remove the turkey from the over to a platter. Let rest for 30 minutes before carving.
7. While the turkey is resting prepare the gravy: Place the roasting pan over high heat. Add the cognac and port and bring to a boil while stirring with a wooden spoon to scrape up the little browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Add a little water if the gravy seems too dry. Remove from the heat and strain out all the vegetables. Pour the liquid into a degreasing cup (also called a gravy separator). Let stand for a few minutes to let the fat rise to the top then pour out the pan juices at the bottom of the cup into a saucepan. (All the fat will be left behind.) Reheat and serve as pan juices with the turkey. If you prefer a thicker gravy whisk the buerre manié into the juices and stirring constantly boil until the gravy is smooth and thick about 2 minutes.
8. Untie the turkey and carve it as you would a chicken. Scoop out the forcemeat and serve it on the side.,

instructions, 1. Remove meat from refrigerator 2-3 hours before beginning to allow it to come to room temperature.
2. Keep it on a plate covered in plastic wrap during this time.
3. Heat peanut oil til smoking over high heat.
4. Remove frying pan from heat and carefully add meat.
5. Return pan to heat and sear meat on all sides about 4-5 minutes in total.
6. Salt and pepper the meat*at the end* of searing.
7. Remove meat to an oven-proof dish and transfer to a 350-degree preheated oven until done to desired stage- guideline: 12 minutes per inch of meat thickness.
8. Check meat periodically with a thermometer to ascertain degree of doneness and remove meat from oven when it reaches the doneness you want.
9. (N. B.: This recipe is best rare to medium. Well-done this is a colossal waste of delicious prime beef and you should probably consider eating shoe soles instead or maybe going to McDonald's).
10. While the meat is roasting in the oven prepare the sauce: Mix all listed sauce ingredients and using a handheld mixer whip until you have a cream that will hold peaks and shape.
11. Thinly slice the Chateaubriand against the grain.
12. Arrange the slices on an elegant serving platter and nap with the peppercorn cream.
13. Serve more peppercorn cream on the side.

instructions, 1. Mince the garlic and salt together and crush with the blade of a knife to make a paste. Put the butter in a large bowl (or the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment) add the garlic paste and cream together.
2. Add the parsley chives shallots pepper lemon juice and Pernod or Pastis and mix well. Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a spatula to make certain the ingredients are distributed throughout the butter.
3. Refrigerate for at least an hour or up to 12 hours. (Any extra herb butter is wonderful melted over meats or fish.).
4. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). With a small 1/4 inch round biscuit/cookie cutter cut 24 rounds from the puff pastry and then run a knife around inside the pastry disc leaving a narrow rim - this will be your lid later!. Arrange the puff pastry rounds on the baking sheet. Bake them for 15 to 20 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and well risen. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly.Remove the inner pre-scored "lid" and hollow out the middle a little to make a hole for the snail and butter later!
5. If using ready-made vol-au-vent cases arrange them on a well greased baking tray and add the snails as below now.
6. Place or gently push a snail in to each of the cooked vol-au-vent cases and top with garlic butter the butter can be piped or spooned over the snails — if desired transfer it to a pastry bag without a tip or with a large plain tip.  Re-heat them in a pre-heated oven 450°F (230°C) for about 2 to 5 minutes on a LOW shelf and keep checking that the pastry is not browning too quickly - what you are looking for is BUBBLING melted butter and NOT burnt pastry!
7. Remove them as soon as the butter has melted and serve straight away with a shot of Pastis and lots of paper napkins! (If you have any lids top the buttered snails with a little pastry lid.).,

instructions, 1. Remove excess fat from chicken cavity. Rinse the chicken inside and out. Place 1 bay leaf 2 sprigs parsley and 1/4 teaspoon thyme in cavity. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Melt butter in heavy Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and cook stirring occasionally until onions are translucent (but not browned); about 5 minutes.
3. Place the chicken breast side up in the Dutch oven on top of the onions. Add chicken broth (and water if necessary) to mostly cover the chicken (by about two-thirds). Cover and simmer gently over low heat for 30 minutes.
4. Skim the suface to remove any foam and fat. Add the carrots leeks and celery. Add the remaining parsley sprigs thyme and bay leaf. Cover and adjust heat to maintain a slow simmer for another 30 minutes.
5. Add the potatoes and continue to simmer until potatoes are done and chicken is very tender about 20 or 30 minutes. Remove from heat.
6. Remove chicken and transfer to a large plate. Use a slotted spoon or similar tool to remove parsley and bay leaves from broth. Let the chicken rest until it is cool enough to handle then just use your fingers to remove the skin and peel meat from the bones. Discard skin and bones. Continue to use your fingers to shred the meat into bite-sized pieces.
7. Place Dutch oven with broth (which has cooled a little) over medium heat. While that’s heating up beat the cream and the egg yolks together in a bowl. Now take a ladleful of hot broth and slowly add to the egg yolk mixture while stirring. This tempers the yolks. Then slowly stir the tempered egg yolk mixture into the larger pot of broth and vegetables. Do not boil or the egg yolks might curdle. Add the chicken. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley.
8. Serve in bowls making sure everyone gets equal amounts of chicken vegetable and broth. I serve a with a hearty loaf of hand-sliced bread.
9. Note: Waterzooi can be prepare almost entirely in advance and the flavors are actually enhanced by sitting overnight in the refrigerator. The day before you plan to serve the dish prepare the recipe through Step 5. Let cool completely and refrigerate the broth and vegetable separately from the  chcken. The following day before serving reheat the chicken in the broth. Prepare the egg yolk and cream mixture and proceed with the last steps of the recipe. (The chicken may remain in the broth.).,

5. Bake the cookies/biscuits for 10 minutes swapping trays after 5 minutes or until light golden in colour. Allow to cool on trays completely.

7. Dust with remaining sugar or edible glitter/silver dust just before serving.
8. Note for making holes for hanging on the Christmas Tree: Just before baking take a plastic drinking straw and press into the top of the snowflake shapes - to make a small hole - then gently wiggle the straw around a bit to widen the hole and bake as before. On taking them out of the oven if the holes have closed up a bit gently wiggle around again with a plastic drinking straw to make the holes bigger!

instructions, 1. Put the whole unpeeled potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and simmer gently until a fork goes through the potatoes with little resistance about 40 minutes.
2. Cut the potatoes into smaller chunks and press through a ricer. If you don't have a ricer peel the potatoes and mash with a fork or masher. Measure out 4 loosely-packed cups of riced potatoes and put in a large bowl. Heat the heavy cream butter sugar and salt in a small pot until the butter melts. Add the butter/cream mixture to the potatoes and mix gently. Put the mashed potatoes in the refrigerator to cool down about 30 minutes. Once cooled completely add the flour and work it gently into the potatoes. Do not over work the dough. Allow to rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.
3. Take 2 tablespoons of dough and form it into a ball. Sprinkle flour on a sheet of parchment or wax paper. Using a rolling pin roll out the dough into a very thin circle about 1/16-inch thick and 7 inches wide. Flour the dough as necessary to avoid sticking.
4. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Turn the parchment or wax paper upside down and gently peel off the thin circle of dough onto your hand. Place the dough directly in the heated skillet. Cook on one side until some brown speckles start to form about 1 minute and then flip the dough and cook for an additional 30 seconds. Transfer the cooked lefse to a plate and keep covered with a clean kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining dough.
5. To serve spread butter and sprinkle sugar on a warm lefse and roll it up. If the lefse is cold you can warm it up quickly in a heated skillet.,

instructions, 1. First make your vegan buttermilk by placing the lemon juice in the soymilk and letting it sit for 10 minutes.
2. Combine the whole wheat flour all-purpose flour oil baking soda and salt in a bowl. Mix well.
3. Slowly add just enough "buttermilk" to make a stiff dough.
4. Knead dough for 30 seconds on a well-floured surface such as a board or tabletop.
5. Roll a medium-sized handful of dough (about 1/4 cup worth) into a ball and then pat it down into a flat circle. Be sure to cover the remaining dough so it doesn't become too dry.
6. With a floured rolling pin and on a well-floured surface roll dough into a very thin 10-inch circle. (If dough is sticking to the surface on which you are working dust it with more flour.).
7. Place flatbread on an ungreased cookie sheet. (I would recommend using a 10" pie pan instead.) To make all your flatbread pieces the same shape and size score the dough circles with a knife making triangles X's squares or whatever shapes you prefer. (After baking the flatbread will be broken into pieces along the scored lines.).
8. Bake at 350F for 8 to 10 minutes. Flatbread should be crisp and slightly brown around the edges. Cool on a wire rack and repeat with remaining dough.
9. Break flatbread into pieces and serve plain or with desired topping such as cheese dips or lingonberry preserves.,

instructions, 1. In a large bowl or in the food processor blend the pureed potato flour and salt together.
2. Add the water and blend well until the dough will hold together in a cohesive ball. With a sharp knife divide into 10 equal portions. Turn these out one at a time onto a floured surface and roll into circles.
3. Roll as thin as possible at most 1/8 inch so each is approximately 7 to 8 inches across. Prick all over with the tines of a fork.
4. Lightly oil a griddle or large skillet and heat until it is very hot. One by one place the rolled circles onto the griddle and cook until the bottoms begin to show light browning. Then turn and cook the other side.
5. Keep turning until the whole cracker is dry and crisp. Do not allow the flatbread to get more than medium brown. Cool on a rack.
6. VARIATIONS: Substitute any pureed vegetable for potatoes. Flours other than rye can also be used. Try wheat or barley. If the dough is too sticky to roll add a little more flour. Letting the dough rest for an  hour after mixing will also make it easier to roll.
7. Flatbread can also be cooked in the oven. Bake on an ungreased baking sheet at 400~F. for 8 to 12 minutes or until crisp turning 2 or 3 times.,

instructions, 1. If you're using blanched almonds you can skip this step. But the almonds have to be skinless for this to work or else the skin bits make it all gross and I'd rather pay $4 for a large bag of skinned almonds than $9 for blanched when I can do it myself. Anyway blanch your almonds by placing them in warm water for 15-30 seconds so all the skin peels off.
2. Pulverize the almonds in a food processor.
3. Add the sugar butter and almond (or vanilla) extract. Keep mixing until smooth and perfectly melded.
4. Store in a glass jar or strong airtight plastic container you can keep it at room temperature for up to 5 days and freeze for about 2-3 months.  (Providing it won't magically disappear when you and your friends taste it! lol) Yields about 2 cups.
5. When you want to unfreeze it-- DO NOT microwave transfer it to the fridge to thaw for a couple hours.,

instructions, 1. Place the meat skin side up on a cutting board. With a sharp heavy knife cut through the rind and fat to make a crosshatch pattern with 1-inch squares.
2. With a thin sharp knife make a small slit in each square. (This is where you will insert the cloves; you could insert them now but I have found that all the handling is likely to break off most of the nice-looking tops of the cloves).
3. Rub the meat with the salt and pepper.
4. Place the meat in a baking dish.
5. Cut 1 orange in half and squeeze the juice over the meat.
6. Slice another orange and place the slices under and over the meat.
7. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 days turning three or four times.
8. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
9. Discard the orange and place the meat fat side down in a roasting pan.
10. Insert the sage between the cut ribs.
11. Turn the meat skin side up. Cut the remaining orange in half and squeeze the juice over the meat.
12. Cut the orange halves into smaller pieces and place them under the meat.
13. Insert a clove in each of the slits in the fat.
14. Cover the roast with foil.
15. Place the roasting pan in the middle of the oven and roast for 45 minutes.
16. Remove from the oven and reduce the temperature to 350°F.
17. Remove the foil and Remove the meat from the pan and add potatoes and onions to the pan making a foundation for the meat.
18. Return the meat to the pan and place in the oven this time setting it in the lower third of the oven; roast for about 1 hour.
19. Move the pan to the middle of the oven. Increase the heat to 400° to 425°F and roast for about 20 minutes longer under frequent surveillance to produce a good crackling. If you have a top oven broiler you could use it but be very careful that you don't burn the roast.
20. It is difficult to give the exact time for the crackling process since that depends on the intensity of heat in your oven. If there is no sign of crackling after 10 minutes gradually turn the heat up to 450°F.
21. The crackling will be superb if it looks as if the rind is boiling and the fatty squares have started to separate.
22. Remove and allow to cool slightly.
23. Cut the meat into 2-rib sections and place on serving plates. The meat looks nice served with the cloves but be advised that they should be removed before eating as they are still quite strong-tasting.
