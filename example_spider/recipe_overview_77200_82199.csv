instructions, 1. Gently melt butter and white chocolate in large bowl in microwave.
2. For best results don't over melt if just a few chocolate pieces appear solid stir them in with what has already melted until it's all smooth.
3. Add coconut milk coconut essence (optional) desiccated coconut and icing sugar.
4. Stir until well mixed.
5. Recipe says chill so you can roll it into balls freeze etc but personally I spooned my mixture into two small plastic bags so that it formed slabs about 2cm thick then threw it into the freezer for at least 2 hours.
6. Remove slabs from freezer peel away plastic bags and"dice" your mixture so that you have a plate full of little cubes.
7. Microwave your dark or milk chocolate mixture until half of it is melted stir until all is smooth (doing it like this meant that the mixture started to set quickly and evenly around the cubes and didn't just make puddles at their bases).
8. Dip the cubes one by one into the darker chocolate mixture turning over with a teaspoon until evenly coated.
9. Place coated cubes onto a tray lined with foil.
10. Leave at room temperature to set and store in a cool place (not the fridge).
11. Edited to add: making the filling into round balls does look more professional and less "home made" --  mind you once your family and friends have tasted these they honestly won't care how they look they'll be too busy diving back in for another one :).
12. I loved the suggestion about the other flavours and played around with it --  some of my guests preferred 2T Tia Maria etc for a softer more mellow taste other preferred theirs with 3T for a stronger taste.
13. The mixtures with the Baileys/Tia Maria were softer and a little more sticky than the original so *slightly* more messy rolling them but your guests will love you for the 10 minutes extra work.,

cuisine, Australasian >> Australian >> New Zealander, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Directions are as per Taste magazine April 2009 but I've added my changes after the **.
2. Preheat oven to 140°C Put 2 x 20cm flan rings (without bases) on baking trays lined with baking paper. Either line inside of rings with strips of baking paper (use a dab of meringue later on to hold the strips of paper in place) or lightly brush the inside of the rings with melted butter and dust with flour.  **I didn't have flan rings so just drew 20cm circles on the baking paper and spread out as close to lines as I could.  The mixture spread out a little so maybe 18cm circles would've been better but up to you.
3. Push brown sugar through a coarse sieve. Whip egg whites until soft peaks form then gradually beat in the brown sugar 1 Tbsp at a time. Continue whisking for 2-3 minutes until thick and satiny. Divide meringue between the flan rings being careful not to knock out air. Smooth the surface with a knife.
4. Bake for 1 hour preferably on the same shelf otherwise alternate the position of the meringues once or twice during baking. Remove from oven and cool for 10 minutes. Carefully slip a slim sharp knife between meringue and flan ring to loosen then leave to cool completely.
5. When cool put a light cake rack on top of each meringue invert then peel off the paper. Loosen from flan ring and remove ring then turn meringue top side up again.  **I was too busy to do any of this and just left them on the baking tray until I assembled it all together.
6. Melt chocolate with 3 Tbsp water in a microwave or in a small saucepan over gentle heat stirring continually. Cool. Whip cream until just thick and holding shape — and this is important — if it is too stiff it will turn buttery by the time the chocolate is folded in (if this happens let it down with a little liquid cream — it may help). Pour in chocolate and gently fold cream and chocolate together with a large spoon.  ** I didn't get all the 'lumps' out of the chocolate (90% melted) and it resulted in lovely crunch throughout the cream.  Make sure the chocolate is cool enough that it wont melt the cream.
7. Put 1 meringue on a cake stand or plate then spread with chocolate cream filling. Put the other meringue on top and dust with icing sugar. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving or up to 8 hours (it keeps well refrigerated for 2-3 days).  ** A dab of cream on the plate will stop the meringue sliding around.  As for it keeping I can't promise that as it lasted a total of 3 hours lol.,

6. Variations:.
7. Add kirsch or a liqueur of your choice.
8. Substitute 1 tablespoon of fresh chopped mint for the chilli.
9. =========================================.
10. Directions for chopping up pineapple:.
11. Chop the leaves off the top and take a slice off the bottom of the pineapple so that it can stand up.
12. Slice off the skin starting at the top and taking 1 inch wide slices to the bottom.  This will leave the flower buds (the spiky brown bits) but not remove too much of the sweetest flesh which is near the skin.
13. Lay the pineapple on its side and you will notice that the flower buds are in a spiral pattern around the pineapple.
14. Cut out the buds with a v-groove following the diagonal pattern of the buds.  Make a shallow cut one side and then complete the v-groove by cutting the other side. A flick with the knife will remove the buds without too much of the flesh.
15. Once all the buds have been cut out slice the pineapple into 1-2cm slices.
16. Take a slice and holding it over a bowl to catch all the juice make two cuts into the slice from the edge to the core about 1-2cm apart.
17. Snap out the wedge from the core.  It will break naturally at the edge of the tough bit a bit like snapping the ends off asparagus.
18. Continue cutting wedges and snapping them from the core until all you are left with is the core. The cook gets to suck on the cores!
19. Repeat for the other slices.
20. All the pineapple in the bowl will be succulent juicy and ready to pop in your mouth – or your lover’s mouth if this a romantic dinner for two. ;).,

4. Cut the oranges in half and de-seed them and put the oranges (with peel and pith)  into a food processor and pulp until reasonably smooth.
5. Pour the pulp into the sugar/egg mix  and add the almond meal. Gently mix together.
6. Pour mix into baking paper lined 24 - 26cm springform tin and bake for 50 - 60 minutes at 185°C.

instructions, 1. For the ricotta combine all the ingredients in a food processor or cake mixer. Process or whisk until smooth and shiny (about 5-8 minutes). The ricotta can be refrigerated at this stage and kept for 1 or 2 days but do allow it to come to room temperature and give it a good whisk before serving.
2. For the peaches combine all ingredients except the peaches in a heavy-based saucepan.
3. Score the top of the peaches as you would for blanching a tomato. In a small saucepan just large enough to hold the peaches bring the syrup to the boil then add the peaches. Cover with a piece of greaseproof paper and simmer gently until the skin starts to come away from the fruit (about 5-10 minutes depending on the ripeness).
4. Remove the peaches from the syrup with a slotted spoon and plunge into iced water to cool. Reduce the syrup by a third over a rapid heat or until thick and glossy. Strain and reserve. Once the peaches are cool gently peel off the skin. If not using right away refrigerate the peaches at this stage.
5. Cut in half remove the seeds and place the peach halves in a single layer on a flat heatproof tray. Spoon a little of the peach syrup over the peaches and grill for 5-8 minutes under a hot grill until slightly caramelised.
6. To assemble smear a thick layer of ricotta on each piece of sourdough. Place 2 peach halves on each. Toss the raspberries in the reserved syrup then divide among the 4 bruschetta (you probably won’t need all the syrup which can be reserved for another use). Top with the mint leaves. Dust each dish with a good amount of icing sugar and serve right away.,

2. Add the garlic and washed and chopped spinach. Cook until all the liquid has evaporated. Set aside to cool.
3. Line a baking dish (size smaller than the sheets of phyllo) with 4 sheets of phyllo brushing each sheet with butter and finishing with an unbuttered sheet.
4. Fill the pie with the spinach mixture.
5. Lightly beat the eggs with the milk and seasoning. Pour over the spinach.
6. Grate the gouda on top of the spinach. I used a mild cheese with garlic and herbs through it. You may want to add other herbs if you use an unseasoned cheese.
7. Peel and thinly slice a kumara. I use a mandoline for this. The slices need to be quite thin to cook in the same time as the egg mixture.
8. Lay the slices on top of the spinach and cheese overlapping slightly.
9. Dot the top with butter and put in an oven at 180degC or 350F for 30 minutes or until the kumara is soft.
10. Grate some parmesan cheese over the kumara in the last 5 minutes of cooking. Note: the kumara will probably discolour slightly but the parmesan cheese covers that up. Turn the oven temp up a little to brown the cheese.

5. Stir until the toffee is smooth (you may have to return it to the heat to help it dissolve). Pour into the base of the buttered cake tin. Set aside.
6. Now for the cake. Beat butter and sugar together using an electric beater until pale and creamy. Add eggs and beat until well combined. Mix in the sour cream.
7. Sift together flour baking powder ginger and cinnamon and then fold into the sour cream mixture.
8. Core peel and halve the pears and arrange flat side down over the toffee in the cake tin. Spoon the cake mixture over the pears and spread evenly.

While it still turned out fine there wasn't as much sauce as I would have liked. If the pudding cooks faster than the recommended time it still turns out okay if the cooker is turned on to the 'keep warm' setting until you're ready to serve.,

instructions, 1. Special equipment:
2. 12 corn husks soaked in water for 30 minutes. If you cannot find corn husks use aluminum foil or parchment paper.
3. For the stuffing:
4. In a large skillet saute the onions in the oil over medium-high heat until translucent about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and garlic and continue sauteing until the moisture releases and completely evaporates about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat. Add the cheese and herbs and set aside.
5. For the masa:
6. Combine the masa harina with the stock and salt. Work in the lard until you get a spreadable consistency. If necessary add a bit more stock.
7. To assemble the tamales:
8. Drain and pat dry the corn husks. Spread the masa about 1/8-inch thick on each corn husk with your fingers leaving about 1/2-inch border along the sides and a 2-inch border along the top and bottom of the husks. The key to good tamales is to spread the masa thinly. Then use about 2 tablespoons/30 ml of the mushroom stuffing per tamale. Top with 2 to 3 poblano strips. Fold the sides until they just overlap fold the narrow end under and place the tamales folded-side down in the steamer.
9. To cook steam the tamales covered in a bamboo steamer over simmering water until the masa is no longer sticky about 1 hour. (The tamales can be kept in the freezer for 3 months.).
10. Serve the tamales garnished with salsa crumbled queso fresco and cilantro.
11. Cook's Note:
12. You can substitute queso fresco with any cheese you like such as smooth goat cheese feta etc. You can stuff tamales with almost anything pork chicken ground meat etc.,

instructions, 1. Place rice in a large bowl and cover with very hot tap water. Let stand 10-15 minutes. Then rub and squeeze rice with your fingers until the water is cloudy. Drain the rice in a strainer. Cover it with cold water. Rub and squeeze rice again then drain. Repeat the cold water and draining process once more or as many times as it takes to get the water fairly clear. Drain the rice thoroughly and spread it on a platter to dry. You can use rice while it is still wet but there is danger of spattering hot oil when wet rice is added to the skillet. Rice usually takes 1 hour or more to dry.
2. Mash garlic with salt to make a paste. Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add rice. Cook and stir over medium heat until lightly browned. Add onion and garlic paste. Cook and stir until onion is tender. Stir in tomato sauce and chicken broth.
3. Cook and simmer until most of the liquid is absorbed. Reduce heat to very low and steam 30-45 minutes until rice is tender.,

instructions, 1. For this quantity of rice you will need a flameproof pan about 4 inches (10 cm) deep and 9 inches (23 cm) across. Pour hot water to cover over the rice and let soak for about 5 minutes. Strain rinse in cold water and strain again. Be sure to shake the strainer well to remove the excess water. Do not do this step ahead of time or the rice will become too damp.
2. Heat the oil in the pan and stir in the rice - it should sizzle as it touches the oil. Stir until the grains are evenly coated and continue frying over medium heat until they sound brittle and are just starting to turn golden about 10 minutes. Tip the pan to one side and drain off the excess oil.
3. Meanwhile put the tomatoes onion and garlic into a blender jar and blend until smooth. Stir the puree into the rice and continue frying over fairly high heat scraping the bottom of the pan to avoid sticking until the mixture has been absorbed about 5 minutes.
4. Add the broth and the optional ingredients; stir the rice well adjust the salt cover the pan and cook over medium heat until all the broth has been absorbed - air holes will probably form. Carefully dig to the bottom of the rice with a fork to see if any moisture remains; if so then continue cooking over low heat for a few minutes more. Set aside still `covered to give the rice a chance to continue steaming evenly for about 15 minutes.
5. When serving gently stir the rice from the bottom with a fork.,

instructions, 1. To Char Poblanos: Leave the stem on the chile intact and place it directly over an open flame of a gas stove or a wood or charcoal grill. If using electricity then smear the chile with a light coating of oil and place it right up under the broiler. Turn the chiles from time to time to allow the skin to blister and char lightly all over. Do not allow the flesh to be burnt right through.
2. Place them immediately into a plastic bag and leave them to "sweat" for about 10 minutes. This helps to loosen the skin. The skin can now be slipped off easily- little pieces of charred skin are ok.
3. Marinade: Mix all the marinade ingredients well and set them aside.
4. Leaving the top of the chiles intact slit down the side and carefully remove seeds and veins. Put the chiles into the marinade and refrigerate them at least 2 days turning them from time to time.
5. Guacamole: When you are ready to serve the chiles crush the onion. Cut open the avocados and scoop out the flesh. Mash with the onion lime juice and salt.
6. Serving: Drain the chiles and stuff them well with the guacamole. Arrange on a bed of lettuce leaves on a serving dish and decorate them with the pomegranate seeds or chopped cilantro.,

instructions, 1. Brown the pork sausage in a pan and break up into chunks preferrably about the size of a pea.  Drain off the grease and return to the pan.
2. Add the diced onion and green pepper to the drained and cooked pork sausage and cook until onion begins to become clear.  If you have a large skillet you can continue to use that otherwise transfer the pork sausage/green pepper/onion mixture to a crock pot (lining it makes cleanup easier).
3. Add the cans of Rotel tomatoes and can of mushrooms discarding some of the water from the Rotel cans if you prefer a thicker queso.
4. Mix well and begin adding the Velveeta cheese broken into chunks for faster melting.  It does tend to melt faster in a large skillet rather than a crock pot.
5. Transfer the mixture to a crock pot and keep warm.  Eat with the thicker tortilla tortilla chips as they are better equipped to handle the load of cheese meat and veggies.  Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Scrape 1 to 2 Tbsp of the fat which has formed a layer on top of the drippings.
2. Melt the fat in a medium sized frying pan.  (Don't use a non-stick pan for this recipe as you may damage the coating.).
3. Saute the onions and garlic in the fat until soft.
4. Add the beans and about 1/3 cup of the congealed broth.  The broth will be the bottom layer under the fat.
5. Mash the beans with a potato masher.  Get the mix as creamy as you want it.  Add more congealed broth if you want your beans soupier.
6. Then add the cheese and mix till it is melted.
7. Keep the beans firm if you are making burritos.  Make them soupy if you are using them as a dip.  Medium soupyness makes a great side dish.
8. Enjoy!  These are some killer beans.,

instructions, 1. Spread the potatoes over the bottom of a slow cooker and top with the pork.
2. Set a medium (8 inch) skillet over medium heat. When it is hot toast the chili pieces a few at a time pressing them against the hot surface with a spatula until they are aromatic and lightened in color underneath – about 10 seconds per side. (If you see more than a whiff of smoke they are burning). Transfer the toasted chilis to a blender jar.
3. Add the tomatoes with their juice garlic oregano Worcestershire sauce a generous 1 ½ tsp salt and 1 ½ cups water. Blend until as smooth as possible. Strain the mixture through a medium mesh strainer directly into the slow cooker over the meat and potatoes. Stir to mix thoroughly.
4. Set the lid in place and slow cook on high for 6 hours.
5. Gently stir the stew – the sauce may look slightly broken but it will come together with gentle stirring. If the sauce seems too thick stir in a little water. Taste and add more salt if needed.
6. Serve in bowls sprinkled with the cilantro and onion. A stack of warm corn tortillas is the perfect accompaniment.
7. Variations:
8. Pork and Potatoes al Guajillo as a Soft Taco Filling:
9. Cook the dish as directed above but cube the potatoes rather than leaving them in larger wedges. Coarsely shred the pork with two forks. Leave the sauce quite thick. Serve with a dozen warm tortillas for everyone to make soft tacos.,

2. Toss with oil then with taco seasonings.
3. Add to slightly greased pan and bake in 425°F oven 10 minutes turn 10 more minutes.
4. These will likely come out better (and not need to be turned) if you place a cooling rack on/in the cookie sheet and then place the fries on the rack.  The air gets right around the fries.  (Tip learned from Rachael Ray).,

instructions, 1. Soak your beans. (This very important if you want tender beans). Bring beans to boil in 8-10 cups of water. Remove from heat covered. Let the beans soak for 30-45 minutes until the beans start to swell from the water infusing into them.
2. Strain the beans. Bring another 8 cups of water to a boil. (The reason for this is to get all the excess dirt and debris out of the beans).
3. While beans are boiling trim the ham hocks of fat; leave fat in large pieces. Cut the meat into small bite-size pieces. Put all into pot. Remove fat and bones when your beans are done.
4. Chop all veggies into small pieces. Combine veggies meat fat and spices into large stock pot or dutch oven and simmer for at least 2 1/2  hours. Remove fat when finished. Taste add more seasoning if needed.,

instructions, 1. DIRECTIONS:
2. A day in advance trim fat from meat. If not already cut into 4 strips cut meat into 4 strips and place into a large pot.
3. Add broth or water onion garlic bay leaves 1 tablespoon salt peppercorns 1/2 teaspoon oregano and 1/2 teaspoon cumin.  Bring to a boil.
4. Reduce heat cover and simmer 1 hour. Drain meat reserving about 5 cups of the broth for the tamale dough.
5. With 2 forks shred the meat and mix in 4 tablespoons flour 1 tablespoon salt.
6. 1 tablespoon ground black pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano and 3 tablespoons ground cumin. If too dry add a little broth to make it like a paste.
7. Refrigerate the meat mixture and the reserved broth overnight. If you like it on the tangy side add some chopped chilis to the meat mixture.
8. You will only use about half of the meat filling mixture. The other half you can freeze for the next time you make tamales. So the next time you will only have to make the dough.
9. The next day soak the corn husks in hot water 1 hour to soften. Also soak a few additional husks to cover tamales. Rinse and pat dry with paper towels.
10. Prepare the dough by mixing all the dough ingredients except the corn husks with warm pork broth. You will need to make 2 batches of the dough. Hold each corn husk with point towards you. Place a rounded tablespoonful of dough at large end of husk. Spread with fingers. Place 2 or 3 tablespoons of pork filling on dough. Top with another tablespoon of dough and spread to cover filling.
11. Fold sides of husk over the tamale. Fold pointed end of corn husk under the seam on outside. Stand tamales on folded ends on a steaming rack over water in a large pot.
12. Cover with additional layers of husks. Bring water to a boil. Reduce heat cover and steam 1 hour or until dough pulls away easily from husk. Makes about 32 tamales.,

instructions, 1. Butter a 8"x12" baking pan and heat oven to 375°F  If you need to toast the cornbread you can do so while the oven is preheating.  Just chop/crumble it and spread evenly in one layer on two baking pans.  Place in oven and toast stirring every few minutes.  The cornbread should be toasted by the time you finish up the next three steps - if not just give it a few more minutes.
2. Heat bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook until fat is rendered and bacon is crisp about 10 minutes.  Transfer bacon to a bowl lined with paper towels.
3. Add onion to bacon fat in pan and cook until softened about 5 minutes. Add peppers & celery and cook 3 minutes more.
4. Stir in reserved bacon along with adobo seasoning parsley and stock.  Bring to a simmer then remove from heat.
5. Combine the toasted cornbread and bacon-stock mixture in a large bowl.  Toss lightly just so all the bread is wet and liquid is absorbed.  Now add the crumbled queso fresco and stir once or twice so the cheese is incorporated.  Don't stir too much- you don't want the cheese to melt!
6. Transfer to prepared baking dish place in oven and bake until top is crisp and golden brown about 30–35 minutes.,

instructions, 1. Cook rices in 1 1/4C water. When done turn off heat and fluff with a fork. Yield will be about 2 3/4C cooked rice.
2. Heat 1/4C water in a fry pan. Cook the onions in this until they are transluscent. Drain extra water (if any) into a small bowl. Stir olive oil into rice.
3. Open chilis but not quite all the way. Push down on the lid to squeeze the liquid from the can into the small bowl with the water above. Set aside.
4. In another bowl beat 1C of the cottage cheese until the consistency of sour cream. Stir in the buttermilk powder or lemon juice. If you had a lot of liquid you may need to add more cottage cheese to get the correct consistency. Add up to 1/4C more cheese if necessary.
5. Mix the rice unbeaten cottage cheese onions taco seasoning and drained chilis together.
6. Spray a 9 x 9 pan with cooking spray. Put about 1/2  the rice mixture on the bottom in an even layer. Add a layer of the beaten cheese. Take 2 slices of the pepper cheese cut them in 1/2 and place them in the four quadrants of the pan (The idea is to get the cheese into the middle of the food.). Repeat this process starting with the rice mixture ending with the pepper jack forming a  2nd layer.
7. Put the bread crumbs in the cottage cheese container to pick up whatever food remains then scoop it out and add them to the liquids in the bowl. Mix throughly. This should be crumbly not wet. Sprinkle the moistened bread crumbs on top of the 2nd layer of pepper jack cheese until the top of the casserole is completely covered.
8. Bake 375 for 25 minutes. Turn on broiler and brown on top for the last 5 minutes or less as required by your oven.,

5. My Note:   This is AS CLOSE TO AUTHENTIC as possible. I love "cheater" recipes like this. Open a few cans dump it in and wa-la! In Mexico we buy the right variety of peppers cook them down throw them in the blender etc to make meals like this. This saves all that hassle for a genuine taste. My entire family says it's as good as the tortilla soups served here in local restaurants. That's the highest compliment a recipe can be given! Don't bother cooking the chicken ahead of time. Throw it in with the rest in the beginning and shred it 2-3 hours later. Hint: serve with lime juice a tsp of sour cream chopped avocados or pork rind along with the cheese to really eat it like a Mexican. BTW I bought bagged tortilla chips and worked fine.
6. I threw in a couple of frozen chicken breasts rather than cooking them first and saved myself a step. (I shredded them towards the end.) I also used bagged tortilla chips instead of making my own.
7. This recipe would be a little more authentic if you skip the canned enchilada sauce and instead made your own. VERY EASY. Take 3-4 large dried ancho chiles (cut off the stems and remove the seeds) and boil them with a cup or so of water garlic and onion. After a half hour whir it all together in your blender with a small can of tomato puree. Add some cumin if you like. Salt to taste. I live in Mexico and believe me there is NO such thing as canned enchilada sauce here. Also - the shredded or sliced chicken is usually added as a garnish here not cooked in the soup.,

instructions, 1. Preparing the uchepos:
2. Cut through each corncob at the thickest part just above the base. Unwrap the leaves very carefully trying to keep them whole and trim off the points. Rinse the leaves and set them aside to drain.
3. Cut the kernels from the cobs as near to the core as possible. You should have 4 cups of kernels.
4. Put the kernels into the blender with the water and salt and grind them until they are very smooth. It will be much easier to do in 2 lots. You will have to keep stopping the blender and releasing the blades; but do not add more water.
5. Making the uchepos: Smear a thin coating of the corn mixture over the broadest part of the cornhusk allowing for turning down about 1 1/2-inches at the bottom broad part of the husk and about 3-inches high at the pointed top. Fold the sides of the husk together firmly. Turn up the pointed end of the leaf and fold the broader over it.
6. Cooking the uchepos: The most convenient way to cook uchepos is with a conventional steamer. Fill the bottom of the steamer with water up to the level indicated and bring it to a boil. Line the top of the steamer with cornhusks covering the bottom and sides well. Stack the uchepos upright. For the best results they should be packed firmly but not too tightly because the husks swell out as the dough cooks.
7. Cover the uchepos with more cornhusks. Cover the top of the steamer with a thick cloth a piece of old toweling is best to absorb the condensation from the lid of the steamer. Cover the steamer with a tightly fitting lid.
8. As the water in the bottom part comes to a boil put a coin into it put the top part of the steamer on and let the uchepos cook for about 2 1/2 to 3 hours over a medium flame. Keep the water bubbling but not boiling violently. That is the reason for the coin. You will be able to hear it dancing about and it will tell you if the water goes off the boil or is getting dangerously low. It the water is allowed to go off the boil the uchepos will be heavy. Keep a kettle of water simmering so that you can refill the steamer when necessary.
9. To test the uchepos for doneness remove 1 from the center and 1 from the side of the steamer. As you open the husks the dough should come away easily from the husks and be completely smooth. To make doubly sure open up the uchepos and see if they are spongy and well cooked throughout.
10. I serve them with sour cream and salsa red or green whatever you prefer.,

instructions, 1. Hack squash open using a big broad knife--and WORK at it to divide it in half lengthwise.
2. Scoop out the seeds.
3. Place on baking sheet or big baking dish turned over. Pierce the skin all over with a fork. Bake at about 375 or 400 degrees F for about 40 - 45 minutes. Remove squash halves from the oven. Using your baking mits turn squash over and if it's just right you should be able to scrape the innards with a spoon and the squash will come out sort of like noodles--really more like slaw.
4. Heat some oil in a sizable skillet (large enough so that you can eventually mix in the squash with the other ingredients. Add ingredients in any order that makes sense to you. For me taking my cue from Indian cookbooks I typically sizzle up the spicy ingredients with the seeds and nuts first--browning them together and flavoring the oil. Next I add the onions and jalapenos and let them reduce/brown. Then add the garlic and the Chili Garlic sauce (and/or the lime or lemon juice). Toss in the black beans and the cilantro leaves and mix / heat thoroughly.
5. Toss in the spaghettified squash mix thoroughly. Serve in bowls topped with the corn chips.,

2. Place beans water 1 tblspn shortening and sliced onion in 3Ltr saucepan. bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer  one and a half hours or just until beans are tender not soft.   (Not necessary with canned beans here is where you save time).  The onion cooks properly even in the shorter time I cooked the beans like this for about 30 minutes.
3. Stir in salt Cover and simmer over very low heat 30 to 45 minutes until beans are very soft.   Do not drain.
4. (Flavour is improved if beans are prepared to this point then refrigerated covered overnight before completing recipe.).
5. Heat remaining 1/3 cup shortening in heavy large skillet over high heat until very hot. Add chopped onion and garlic. Reduce heat to medium. Cook and stir 4 minutes or until onion is softened.
6. Increase heat to high.  Add 1 cup undrained beans. Cook and stir mashing beans with bean or potato masher.
7. As beans begin to dry add another 1 cup undrained beans. Cook and stir mashing beans with bean or potato masher. Repeat until all beans and cooking liquid have been added and mixture is a coarse puree. adjust heat as needed to prevent beans from sticking and burning. Total cooking time will be around twenty minutes.

instructions, 1. Boil potatoes whole in salted water until done.
2. Put poblanos on a cookie sheet and broil until black.  Turn and blacken on all sides.  Remove poblanos and put right into a plastic bag and seal so no steam escapes.  Set aside.
3. Meanwhile heat oil in large skillet on medium high heat.
4. Add onions and cook until wilted and slightly browned.
5. Peel and cube cooked potatoes (about 1/2-inch cubes).
6. Turn skillet temp up to high and add potaotes.
7. You may need to add more oil.  Potatoes tend to suck it all up and you want the potatoes to kind of "fry".  You want to get some color on the potatoes so stir and then let them cook and brown before stirring again.  The potatoes will fall apart and kind of mash but that's OK.
8. Add lots of salt and some pepper to taste--do taste to make sure it is salty enough.
9. Under running water peel skins off of poblanos and remove stems and seeds.
10. Coarsely chop poblanos.
11. When potatoes have some nice color on them add poblanos garlic and queso fresco.  Cook for another 5 minutes.
12. Note:  I use this as a filling for vegetarian   tacos or for quesadillas but they would be good as even a side dish or for breakfast instead of hashbrowns.,

2. Brush the corn with melted butter or olive oil. Grill the corn until hot and lightly charred all over 7 to 10 minutes depending on the temperature of the grill. Alternatively broil the corn ears 6-inches from the heat source until charred spots appear about 10 minutes. Flip the corn and broil for an additional 10 minutes.
3. While the corn is charred mix the cilantro garlic chile powder salt mayonnaise and lime juice.
4. Spread the mayonnaise mixture evenly over the corn and sprinkle with Romano cheese. If desired return the corn to the grill or broiler for just a few minutes. Serve warm with lime wedges.
5. Cook's Notes:
6. Grilled Corn Serving Variations:
7. Smaller Portions For A Party:
8. Cut each corn on the cob in half creating double the amount of servings.
9. Elotes Corn Salad:
10. After charring the corn cut it off the cob and toss with the mixed dressing still serving with lime wedges and chopped cilantro. Easier.
11. To Handle:
12. Make sure to provide your guests with plenty of napkins for eating. You can also stick a rounded skewer or popsicle stick in one end of the corn making it easier to pick up and eat.,

cuisine, Latin American >> Mexican >> Mexican, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Start by making the dressing. In a small glass bowl mix the Greek yogurt with milk and the "Hidden Valley Ranch" seasoning mix cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (up to 24 hours) --  and away we go! --.
2. "Stove-top / Broiling method for Elote": On the stove-top boil frozen corn on the cob according to package instructions (or micro-wave per instructions). If using fresh remove husks and boil corn in large sauce pan until tender. IMPORTANT: Save about 1/2 c of the water from the boiling process (it contains the starch) for the "Esquites" preparation method.
3. While corn is boiling preheat oven to 500* F with a rack set in middle of oven.
4. When the corn is cooked thru remove the ears of corn to a platter.
5. Okay here is where we can 'part ways' on cooking methods --  but for now I'm sticking with the stove-top / broiler method for "Elote".
6. Now that the corn is cooked line a baking tray with aluminum foil. Brush each ear of corn with the melted butter salt and pepper lightly and place on tray (NO chili powder yet).
7. Place tray in oven and bake for approx 15 minutes +/- rotating (rolling) corn often until all sides are lightly browned. Once you've reached your desired browning remove the corn to that same platter that we dirtied earlier.
8. "Grilled Elote" (the true way): The other alternative is using your grill to brown. If you are starting your corn on the grill (while skipping the boiling method) be sure to remove silk only and soak corn in water before grilling. Leave husks on while grilling until your ready to brown them. when cooked thru remove husks brush with melted butter and grill ears while turning to desired browning has been achieved.
9. (There you have the basics done. Now were 'parting ways' again --  You can have one cob each that serves 4 or you can cut each cob in half to make 8 small servings. Now at this point you can shave the kernels off of the cob using a serrated knife into a bowl and "voila" we are now morphing into "Esquites" --  but please wait patiently for that).
10. If you want "Elote" leave the cob in tact slather it with the dressing we made earlier heavily sprinkle on the grated Parm and add a little minced chives. (Heck roll it thru them)! Squeeze a wedge of lemon over the whole thing and add the touch of chili powder (if you so desire). Now your Americanized Ranch version of "Elote" is done.
11. "Esquites": You've shaved the kernels off the cob after boiling and browning. Now put the kernels in a bowl add the desired amount of water that the corn was boiled in (1/4-1/2 c) then throw in a heap of the dressing cheese and chives and mix well. Squeeze a couple of lemon wedges 'over the top' (only after mixing). Enjoy!
12. *** I used the following substitutions to make my "Ranched-up" version vs the traditional:
13. Greek Yogurt milk & Ranch seasoning = mayo.
14. Parmesan cheese = Cotija  cheese.
15. lemon = lime.,

2. Add to the beans one of the garlic cloves finely minced 2 tablespoons of the onion bay leaf and a dash of black pepper.
3. Cover and cook on HIGH for 2-3 hours (or until beans start to boil) then cook on  LOW for approximately 5-6 additional hours. Or cook on LOW all day for about 9-10 hours.
4. Once cooking time has commenced check to see if beans are soft. DO NOT drain!
5. Heat a cast iron skillet* on medium heat and saute the onion other garlic clove cumin powder and oregano in a little bit of oil. With a slotted spoon transfer the cooked beans to the skillet and begin by mashing   using a potato masher. Add some reserved cooking liquid to help mash; mashing to desired consistency. (I puree most of the beans as we like our beans on the soupy side.).
6. Once the beans are mashed to your liking stir in the liquid smoke and butter and about 1 teaspoon salt. Cook stirring constantly until butter is melted. Taste and adjust all seasonings. You will probably need more salt.
7. Serve and garnish each serving with a sprinkle of grated cheddar cheese and some green onion slices.
8. Save about 2 cups of the reserved cooking liquid for reheating the refried beans. DO NOT use water to rehydrate!
9. *Cast iron will alter the color of the beans. This does NOT effect the taste.,

3. Pour in the milk leaving back one or two Tablespoons. It will  be pretty moist but should make a ball after 10 to 20 seconds of gentle mixing and very little kneading.  Use the rest of the milk if necessary.  Don't despair if the dough is a sticky tacky mess.  Only If necessary sprinkle in a a little more flour to turn it into a ball working it as little as possible.
4. Divide and roll the ball into six or seven balls. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let set 30 minutes.

6. Roll out a tortilla using light flour as needed.
7. Cook each tortilla on one side and then the other (there should be some brown spots) and place on a plate covering with a dish towel as you go. Each tortilla should be stacked on tot of the last and covered with the towel.
8. The towel is very important for keeping the moisture in ensuring that your tortillas will be flexible to fill and fold when the time comes to fill them.

Each time it is different 1/4 cup up to 1/2 cup depending on how long they simmer.  After 5 minutes the beans are done but if you are still waiting on your main dish to be ready maybe add a little more broth as the beans simmer so they don't dry out.

2. 2. Stir in onions and cook until tender. Stir in tomato sauce and chicken broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low cover and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
3. My Note:   A good basic restaurant style Mexican rice. The key to this recipe is the seasonings you use. I tried it as written just with the cumin and it was not nearly as good as it was when I did it a second time using My Taco Seasoning  I just sprinkled in what looked like enough about 1-1/2 teaspoons This mixture includes cumin and many other spices which are perfect for this recipe. I also cooked my onion in the oil BEFORE adding the rice to get it nice and soft added fresh minced garlic and used chicken stock versus broth. Other than that I followed exactly as written and it was perfect! The cook time is accurate but I find that the last 5 min I need to add a dash of broth to keep it from being too dry.
4. My Taco Seasoning:   Is a mixture of spices and a little cornstarch for thickening that closely resembles The packaged taco seasoning you might find in the store. There is no salt or MSG in this mixture.
5. Ingredients:
6. 6 teaspoons chili powder.
7. 5 teaspoons paprika.
8. 4 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin.
9. 2 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
10. 2 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder.
11. 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch.
12. 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper.
13. Directions:
14. 1. Put in a jar with a tight fitting lid combine chili powder paprika cumin onion powder garlic powder cayenne pepper and cornstarch. Close lid securely and shake well to mix contents. 7 teaspoons is equivalent to 1 (1.25 ounce) package of taco seasoning. Really great it's is "salt free"! This recipe is perfect as is but I love to play with stuff so I used half regular paprika and half smoked paprika upped the cayenne a bit and added some ancho chili powder.
15. If you never been able to get your rice to brown and/or puff in a skillet either as my grandkid she always use a rice cooker instead. She saute the onions minced garlic and cumin in a skillet then throw it into the rice cooker along with the 1 Celsius rice 1-1/2 Celsius chicken broth and all the other ingredients omitting the garlic salt. The cooker shuts off when the rice is done. Easy !,

instructions, 1. By Hand:
2. Combine the flour baking powdersalt and optional dried pasta sauce mix. Either by hand or with a pastry cutter cut in the shortening till the mixture is crumbly. If the mixture looks more floury than crumbly be sure to add just one or two more tablespoons of shortening till it is crumbly. Add about 3/4 cup hot water to the mixture or just enough to make the ingredients look moist.
3. With your hand or a large fork knead the mixture making sure to rub the dough against the sides of the large mixing bowl to gather any clinging dough. If the dough still sticks to the side of the bowl add a couple more tablespoons of flour until the dough forms a soft round shape. The dough is ready to roll out now but it is best to let it rest. Cover it with a dish towel and let it sit for about an hour or so.
4. Take the dough and pull it apart into 10 to 12 balls. Lightly flour your rolling area and roll each ball with a rolling pin to about 1/8 inch thickness.
5. Place each tortilla on a medium hot cast iron skillet. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes on each side or until the tortilla does not look doughy.
6. Bread Machine:
7. Combine flour baking powderoptional dried pasta sauce mix and salt in bread machine. Cut shortening into pieces about the size of olives and drop inches.
8. Start mix cycle and slowly add tap water. Let cycle run five or six minutes then stop machine.
9. Remove dough from bread machine cover with a warm wet towel and let sit for 15 minutes so dough can relax. (Do not skip this step or dough will be difficult to form into tortillas.).
10. Pinch off egg-sized pieces of dough and roll into balls. Use a rolling pin to roll them into thin rounds.
11. Heat a dry cast-iron skillet to medium. Transfer tortillas to skillet and cook until spots on the bottom are dark brown. Flip tortillas and cook on second side until spots are dark brown.
12. Serve immediately. Keep warm in the folds of a kitchen towel if necessary.,

instructions, 1. Heat oil in a large deep fryer until the temperature registers 350 degrees.
2. Roll biscuits into 1/4 inch thin dough snakes. Rolling the flaky biscuit dough on its side will simulate the ridges seen on churros when deep fried. Cut dough snakes in half if they are too long to fit without bending into your fryer.
3. Drop each dough snake into a paper bag filled with only the sugar (do not add the cinnamon yet) and shake to coat. The sugar will melt on the churro as it fries to make it sticky so the final sugar/cinnamon mixture adheres better.
4. Shake off excess sugar.
5. Fry each dough snake until golden brown and crispy on the edges.
6. Remove from oil and drain on a wire rack. Do not drain on paper towels. The sticky sugar will stick to it.
7. Once all the churros have been fried add the cinnamon to the remaining sugar in the paper bag and shake to mix.  Add more sugar if needed.
8. Drop each cooked churro into the bag and shake to coat.
9. Shake off excess sugar mixture and enjoy.,

instructions, 1. First broil peppers in oven on a cookie pan until they are roasted on both sides not burnt so that they can be peeled. They will be black in some areas and you will have to flip them. Hearing a pop is normal. You can cut of the tip of the pepper if you would like.
2. When the peppers are done wrap them all together in a wet/damp cloth to cool. After about 10 minutes they will be cool enough for you to peel them.
3. To peel the pepper simply take off the skin. Be careful not to peel the pepper itself. Its fine if the stems fall off but try to keep them intact so that it is easier when they fry.
4. Get the cheese and stick a slice inside the pepper. Or with whatever you desire.
5. Now is the time to begin heating up the oil so that it is nice and HOT when you have finished the batter. Keep the oil at a high level. And make sure the pan or fryer you are using is deep. The oil sude be half way full in the fryer or pan you are using.
6. Place the flour on a plate or flat surface. Add salt & pepper for taste. Coat the peppers in the flour. They are now ready to be dunked in the batter.
7. To make the batter get a medium sized bowl and add in the 5 egg whites. Save the yolks. Using a hand mixer at its highest speed fluff the egg whites. Make sure they are very fluffy and not runny.
8. Add in the cream of tartar salt & pepper into the bowl.
9. Once this is done add the egg yolks and a tbsp of flour. Continue mixing with the hand mixer.
10. After the batter is prepared completely cover the pepper in it. You can submerge them if this is easier.
11. After being dunked in the batter place the pepper in the HOT oil. Be careful NOT to throw it in the oil or put your fingers in it.
12. Let the pepper fry for about a minute or so and flip it. This can sometimes be tricky so I like using two forks.
13. They are done when the batter is golden brown. Take them out of the oil and place them on a plate with several paper towels. Let them cool for a few minutes then ENJOY!,

instructions, 1. *Note: I fire roasted two fresh green jalapenos on a stove top grill on medium-high heat. Placed them in a paper bag to "sweat"  for about 15-20 minutes then removed the skin seeds and membrane and chopped. Takes longer to do (than opening a can of fire roasted chilies) but the taste was good and fresh. Removing the seeds and membrane is optional if you want the guacamole spicier.
2. In a food processor combine the peas avocado onion chilies lime juice garlic cumin and salt.
3. Process until smooth scraping down the sides of the processor bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.
4. Add the cilantro and pulse until just blended.
5. Adjust seasonings if necessary.
6. Garnish with fresh cilantro and a few whole green peas.

instructions, 1. Combine all ingredients and mix well. This marinade works best if it is made a day in advance so the flavors can blend. Marinate beef lamb and pork for about 6 hours poultry for 4 hours and fish for 1 hour.
2. My Note:   We have steak grilled on the bbq once a week so I decided to experiment with different marinades to taste the differences and ultimately choose a suitable marinade as a main choice. I wasnt sure about how this marinade was going to turn out although I did think that the ingredient combinations were interesting enough to give this a go. Now on to the review: What I noticed was the aromatic citrus flavour of the meat it was not overly strong in flavour but it was not subtle either. It had a definite taste and flavour. Now I like to eat my steaks medium rare with the centre pink and some blood this worked actually quite well because the blood had a lemon with a subtle garlic kind of flavour to it which was quite refreshing. I would recommend this marinade to anyone who wants a refreshing citrus lemon + subtle garlic with hints of herb flavoured steak. I had sauce on the side but honestly the steak tasted better without it the marinade was that good.
3. I combined the ingredients and only had them combine for 1/2 hour; marinate the pre-cut chicken breasts for 2 hours and the chicken was wonderfully tasty! The meat turned out so tasty thanks to this marinade! I didn't let the marinade sit at all before putting the steaks in but I let the meat soak for 8-10 hours. I had made it to make beef tacos and almost decided to just eat the meat plain instead!,

7. Do this with each tortilla and bake in the oven for 5-15 minutes until the cheese is melted and the top of the quesadilla is golden brown.  Remove from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes before cutting into thirds.  Serve with vegan sour cream and a side of Spanish rice.,

instructions, 1. NOTE: for the tomatoes drain them lightly and don't drain them completely dry or you may have to supplement the sauce with jarred salsa (see sauce preparation instructions below).
2. NOTE: for the chicken I usually season 3 skinless boneless breast halves with Tone's Lime Pepper seasoning or Goya Adobo con Pimiento then toss them on the Foreman grill for about 8 minutes.
3. ******************************************.
4. TO PREPARE THE TORTILLA CHIPS:
5. Preheat oven to 375°F.
6. Stack tortillas into three piles of four tortillas each. Cut each pile like a pie into 8 sections.
7. Spray 2 large baking sheets with cooking spray. Divide the tortilla chips between the two pans keeping them in as much of a single layer as possible.
8. Mist the chips with cooking spray and bake them (stirring them a bit once or twice) for 10 to 15 minutes or until crispy and golden.
9. Sprinkle with salt if desired.
10. TO PREPARE THE SAUCE:
11. Pour the drained tomatoes and the chipotles (seeds and all) into a blender. Coarsely puree the mixture (it shouldn't be totally smooth).
12. You need to have approximately 2 1/4 cups of puree. If you come up short rather than using another partial can of tomatoes you can supplement the mixture with some jarred salsa (I use taqueria salsa from either Goya or La Victoria).
13. In a large Dutch oven with a lid heat the vegetable oil and cook about 1/2 cup of the onion stirring regularly for about 7 minutes or until golden.
14. Add the garlic and cook for another minute stirring so garlic doesn't burn.
15. Increase heat to medium-high and add tomato/chipotle puree. Stir almost constantly until the mixture thickens up a bit about 4 or 5 minutes.
16. Stir in the broth and salt to taste (keeping in mind the salt that will be added from the chips if you used it).
17. FINAL COOKING AND ASSEMBLY:
18. Bring the sauce to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the chips and stir to coat.
19. Bring sauce and chips to a rolling boil again. Cover the pan turn off the heat and allow to stand for 5 minutes (no longer because the chips should be s bit chewy and not mushy). Sprinkle cilantro into the pot.
20. Dish out mixture onto 4 warm plates. Divide chicken evenly over top of tortilla mixture and stir lightly to coat chicken with sauce. Top with crema or thinned sour cream remaining chopped onions and both cheeses then serve.,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
2. Lightly toast the ancho chiles either over the burner of a gas stove or in a large saute pan set over high heat. The skin should just start to blister. Remove from the heat and place in a bowl. Cover with hot water and let soak for 20 minutes. Drain reserving the soaking water. Remove the stems and seeds and discard.
3. Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Lightly coat the aluminum foil with vegetable oil. Place the tomatoes cut-side down on the foil with the onion chunks and garlic cloves. Roast until tender and the skin on the tomatoes begins to blacken about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool slightly. Remove the skin from the tomatoes. Place everything in a blender. Add the soaked chiles and 1/4 cup of the soaking water and process until smooth. Add more of the soaking water if necessary to create a smooth sauce. Add the lime juice cumin oregano and cilantro and pulse to combine. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
4. To a large saute pan over high heat add enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Add the diced onion and saute until just translucent about 2 minutes. Add the shrimp and scallops and cook until the shrimp just begin to turn pink and curl. Be careful not to overcook the seafood at this point the mixture will be fried later so it should be slightly undercooked. Add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the sauce and cook for 3 minutes stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and place in a bowl. Add the crab and goat cheese and mix well. Fold in the chayote and cilantro
5. Place 2 cups of the remaining sauce in a saucepan. Add the cream and bring to a simmer. Reduce slightly while you are preparing the chimichangas. Taste and reseason if necessary. Excess sauce can be refrigerated for 1 week of frozen for 2 months.
6. One at a time place the tortillas on a work surface. Spoon a line of the seafood mixture down the center. Fold in the top and bottom to form a package then the sides. Roll to seal. Secure shut with toothpicks
7. Heat several inches of vegetable oil in a deep pot to 360 degrees F. Using tongs lower 1 burrito at a time into the hot oil holding it together with the tongs until it is "sealed." Continue cooking until golden brown on all sides 3 to 5 minutes depending upon their size.
8. Drain on paper towels. Garnish with the creamy sauce guacamole tomatoes sour cream cilantro and onions and serve hot with Black Beans.
9. Guacamole: Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and mash with the back of a fork to combine. Adjust the seasoning to taste. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use.,

12. One at a time place each ball on a lightly floured surface and begin to roll out to a 7 to 8 inch diameter circle.
13. Lay the tortilla on the hot griddle-you should see almost immediate bubbling across the surface-for about 40 seconds turn and cook another 40 to 45 seconds.

7. Put paste in a bowl and stir in liquid until it's a pourable consistency.
8. Heat an empty very heavy frying pan for a few minutes over medium-high heat. Film the bottom of the pan with a small amount of oil. Test temperature by dropping a little mixture into pan. If it sizzles sharply the pan is hot enough.
9. Pour all mixture into the pan don't let the temperature drop. Stir constantly until the mixture has darkened and turned into a thick mass. Usually this takes about 5 minutes.
10. Turn heat down to simmer and add liquid of your choice to the consistency you need. Simmer uncovered for another 5 minutes ro so to develop flavors.
11. Cool and work through a food mill or push through a sieve until there are no lumps.,

cuisine, Latin American >> Mexican >> Mexican, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Start by cutting the halibut into half inch cubes. The smaller the cut on any fish that you're turning into ceviche the faster it will "cook" in the acid.  Set the halibut aside in a small non-reactive container (read plastic or glass preferably plastic).
2. To start the ceviche: core peel and dice your tomatoes just like you would with a tomato concassé. If you're unfamiliar with this technique start by removing the core of the roma tomato and then cut an X in the top of the Roma extending it down to the core making sure to only cut through skin not the flesh.  Drop into boiling salted water for about 30-60 seconds and then rapidly chill in an ice bath.
3. When removed from the ice bath you'll notice that the skin on the tomato has started to peel back slightly. Gripping the skin between your knife blade and your thumb peel it back removing completely. From here simply seed and dice.
4. Next: peel seed and dice an English cucumber and add it to your tomatoes in an appropriately-sized mixing bowl. Add to this tomato/cucumber mixture the diced red onion using the basic onion dicing technique.
5. Add the diced cucumber onion and tomato to the halibut and mix thoroughly to achieve an even dispersion.
6. Cover your ceviche mixture with lime juice and add in the Clamato and ketchup. Yes ketchup. Ketchup is actually common in the ceviche recipes found in Northern Mexico obviously influenced by their northern neighbor's infatuation with salsa el american.
7. The Clamato a mix of clam juice and tomato juice helps round out the flavors of the ceviche liquid as well. Add in some salt to taste and a little sugar to counterbalance the acidity of the lime juice and you're good to go.
8. Allow everything to marinade in the ceviche liquid for at least two hours before serving but no longer then four. When the ceviche is ready to serve you will notice that the flesh has turned opaque and has become firm almost as if it were cooked (which technically speaking it is).
9. When serving the ceviche you can simply place it in a bowl and serve it alongside lime wedges lightly chopped cilantro and tortilla chips.,

4. Refrigerate covered for a few hours at least or like I do make them on the evening and let them in the fridge overnight. This hardens the mixture and makes it easy to handle.
5. When ready to make wet your hands just enough to work with the paste and make small balls until finished.
6. If you like you can put an almond or a nut inside each truffle.
7. Now you can cover them with nuts or chocolate or colorful thingies :) or just leave them like that.
8. You can keep them in the fridge in a covered container for several days but they also hold well unfridge if eaten within 1 or 2 days :).,

instructions, 1. First make the marinade using the following instructions.
2. Rinse peppers under running water. Roast the whole peppers on a warm (not too hot) skillet until warm and dark in color. Do not burn. They burn easily.
3. Soak roasted peppers in hot water (just enough to cover them) for about 20-30 minutes until soft and rehydrated.
4. Combine all marinade ingredients (including the soaking water from the peppers) in a blender. The original recipe does not require removing the tops of the peppers or the seeds; blend them whole into the marinade since the meat will soak and then the marinade will not be used beyond that. Blend until smooth. Set aside.
5. Next prepare the pork:
6. Cut pork ribs into thin strips and remove excess fat. This cut of meat can be tough. If you want to or have to keep the meat whole that is fine.
7. Place the cut meat and marinade into a large bowl. Marinate overnight or for several hours.
8. Grill or fry the marinated pork ribs on an electric griddle or pan. Allow any marinade that clings to the meat to come with it: it will add flavor. Once meat is cooked either cut it into small chunks or leave as thin strips.
9. Grill pineapple rings in the same pan as the pork: the marinade that pooled in the pan under the pork will lend flavor to the pineapple.
10. Soak corn tortillas in the grease solution from the grilled pork. If there was no grease solution from the pork add vegetable oil to the pan and heat. Run corn tortillas through this and keep them warm until serving.
11. Assemble the tacos: take one tortilla pile high with meat place 1/2 ring of pineapple on top squeeze lime juice over the top and top with chopped cilantro.,

instructions, 1. Finely mince the cabbage in your food processor. Transfer to another bowl sprinkle with the salt and allow to drain for about 15 minutes.  Squeeze out all the excess water and pour it back into the food processor.
2. Brown the ground meat over medium high heat. Add the taco seasoning mix and cook until all the liquid evaporates.
3. Pour the meat into the cabbage and pulse to combine. It'll be a reasonably fine mince.
4. Start heating enough oil over medium heat that it'll cover the egg rolls by about 1 inch.
5. Place about 1/4 c of filling on an egg roll wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wrapper with water.  Fold one point snugly over the middle.  Now fold the two side points in over the filling. Continue rolling the rest of the way. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling until all are completed.
6. Once the oil reaches 350F / 177C you can fry up 2-3 rolls at a time for about 3 minutes or until golden brown.
7. Drain on paper towels and serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce.  Jalapeno pepper jelly guacamole and/or salsa would be perfect with this.,

instructions, 1. Soak the Ancho and Guajillo chilis in water overnight or for 3 hours at least. The seeds should float to the top and are discarded. Go over Chili each pepper and clean off any dirt and remove stems and pods. Meanwhile  saute the onion in 2 tablespoons of Corn oil till translucent and soft on a medium heat stirring often. Turn down the heat and add all the Ancho and Guajillo peppers and saute to bring out the flavors. Keep stirring on a medium-low heat making sure not to burn anything. After the Chili peppers are sizzling add in the fresh cilantro and saute for 3 minutes more then add the Ro-Tel on a low heat cover and simmer for 20 minutes stirring occasionally.
2. Cook the ground beef till browned and drain off the liquid. Transfer the ground beef to a mixing bowl and with a wooden spoon mix in 2 tablespoons each of Cumin oregano dried onion cayenne and white pepper and set aside. Back to the chili pepper mixture: Let it cool then put it all in the Blender with 2 cups more Chicken stock and blend till it forms a smooth sauce. Combine the blended peppers with the seasoned Ground Beef & incorporate everything well. This filling mixture should sit and marinate in the refrigerator overnight or at least 3-4 hours.
3. Now do the mixing: The first step to mixing the batter is to season the Masa Mix. Open the package and in a large mixing bowl sift together the mix with  3 tablespoons each of the dried onion cumin cayenne oregano and white pepper. For the actual mixing start by pouring 3 cups of corn oil into the seasoned Masa Mix then take an electric mixer on a low speed and as you mix by machine in one hand use the other hand to slowly pour in a super-small amount chicken stock. You want to keep machine-mixing till it forms a paste. If it doesn't seem to be holding together add in more oil as you machine-mix. If it's too dry simply add a larger amount of chicken stock. Once it forms a reasonably batter-like paste it is ready to be assembled with the filling. Or it can be folded up and wrapped in plastic just like a dough and sit in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks for whenever you are ready to assemble and fill the tamales.
4. Soak the Corn husks in water overnight or until 3 hours before Tamales are ready to be assembled. The husks should be just slightly damp when ready to be assembled and filled.
5. After the filling has sat marinating in the refrigerator it needs to be briefly heated to make sure all the flavors have incorporated. This can be done in the microwave stirring frequently or on the stove.
6. Fill a large stock pot that has a steamer insert with a small amount of water. The water should not touch the bottom of the insert. Set aside.
7. To start assembling take a damp corn husk and spread the batter over it. Take a large spoonful of the ground beef filling and put in the middle. Now close up the husk just like an envelope and wrap in parchment paper  cut to size. Place the filled parchment-papered tamale upright standing up inside the steamer on top of the steamer insert. Repeat these steps until you use up all the filling and the steamer is lined with tamales standing up. You may place a second layer of filled tamales on top of the first layer as long as they are standing up. If the stock pot is deep enough and a large enough amount of tamales to be filled you might end up having 3 or 4 layers going up the sides of the steamer.
8. The tamales steam on low for about 3 hours. Check by simply taking one and opening up the parchment to make sure the batter is firm and done. Serve with my Homemade Salsa (see different recipe).,

10. You can work it with your hands if you like.
11. If it seems too dry add additional water a teaspoon at a time.
12. Too much water and you wont be able to peel the plastic off the tortilla; too little and your tortilla will be dry and crumbly.
13. Unlike pastry dough masa does not suffer from being over-handled.
14. The masa will dry out quickly.
15. Keep it covered with a piece of plastic wrap while making your tortillas.
16. Cut up sandwich or freezer bags (best) work better than the flimsier plastic wrap or waxed paper.
17. Hold the pressed tortilla (with the plastic on both sides) in one hand.
18. Peel away the top plastic from the tortilla (not the tortilla from the plastic).
19. Flip it over into your other hand and peel away the other piece of plastic.
20. Gently place the tortilla on the hot skillet or griddle.
21. It should make a soft sizzling sound when you do.
22. If your tortillas are not perfect circles dont worry; they will still taste wonderful.
23. If your skillet or griddle is at the right temperature a tortilla can be cooked in no more than 2 minutes.
24. The use of cast-iron skillet is important.
25. You are cooking at high heat on a dry surface and a lighter-weight utensil could warp.
26. Brown spots on your tortillas are good.
27. Put your hot tortillas in an aluminum foil pouch wrapped in a kitchen towel or napkin.
28. You want them to stay hot and tender.
29. Corn tortillas can be made 2 hours in advance wrapped and reheated.

instructions, 1. For steak tacos I have the steak run through a machine so it is flat. I haven't tried pounding the chicken flat when making this but I think it may work better. Consider this an optional step as every time I've made it without pounding it it still comes out fantastic but it takes a while to cook. Maybe split breasts would be good.
2. Season meat by sprinkling with Adobo Cumin and Pico de Gallo seasoning. I like to use the adobo that has cumin in it and if you choose to go this route you don't need to use any extra cumin. If you like spicy food use more pico seasoning if you like mild use a smaller amount.
3. Rub seasoning into meat thoroughly.
4. Layer meat onions and garlic in a deep pan or bowl. I have also begun layering lime slices along with it.
5. Pour mango nectar and lime juice over meat so that the liquid just covers the top of the meat. I use about a 3 part mango nectar 1 part lime juice mix.
6. Let sit for several hours or over night.
7. Cook on hot grill.
8. Serve with warm tortillas and desired taco toppings.
9. An alternate cooking method:
10. I had the guy at the meat counter cut up the chicken into taco meat if you shop at a hispanic grocery store they'll know exactly what you mean if you ask them to cut it for tacos but basically its just cutting it into small chunks. I still marinaded everything the same way rubbing the seasonings into the meat is more difficult but still doable. Instead of grilling the meat however after everything marinaded I put the whole mixture marinade and all in a slow cooker. I wouldn't use lime slices in the marinade for this though so you won't have to pick them out.,

2. Remove stems from peppers and cut each pepper into 1/2" to 3/4" rounds (you should get about 3 from each pepper).
3. Using a paring knife or an apple corer remove seeds and ribs from the inside of each pepper round (rubber gloves will be your best friend during this step).  I rinse off the pepper after they're seeded to remove some of the spicy oils.  (Alternate method:  you can also slice in half lengthwise clean out the seeds and ribs then slice crosswise.  This is a little quicker.).
4. Lay out the halved bacon slices.  Place a pepper round in the middle of each one.
5. Stuff each pepper round with cream cheese and top with a sprinkle of cheddar cheese.
6. Fold each end of bacon over the pepper round overlapping the ends and securing with a toothpick.

2. Make a hot water bath for flan by setting a 9-inch pie pan (1-1/4 " deep) in a slightly larger pan. While holding pie pan down so it won't float fill outer pan with just enough hot water to come up around pie pan. Remove pie pan and put outer pan with water in preheated oven.
3. Place 3/4 cup of the sugar in a small heavy pan over medium heat. As sugar begins to melt tip and swirl pan until sugar is completely melted and syrup is a clear medium-amber color. Pour syrup into pie pan and using hot pads to protect hands tilt pan quickly to let syrup coat bottom and sides. Set on a wire rack; caramel will harden rapidly.
4. In a large bowl or blender combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar orange juice lemon juice orange peel and eggs; beat or whirl until well blended. Set caramel-lined pan in hot water bath in oven; pour in egg mixture. Bake uncovered for about 25 minutes or until the back of a spoon pushed gently into center forms a crevice about 3/8 inch deep.
5. Remove pie pan from hot water and let cool slightly; then cover and refrigerate until cold. As flan cools caramel liquefies.
6. To unmold loosen custard edge with a knife then cover with a rimmed serving plate. Holding plate in place quickly invert turning out custard with caramel on top. Garnish with orange slices.,

instructions, 1. Slice pork loin into chops if you want to make it easier to shred and to allow it to cook faster if you're in a hurry.  We do this sometimes but not always.
2. Place pork loin in 6-qt. slow cooker.
3. Pour salsa verde over pork loin.
4. Pour water into cans and swish them around to get the salsa verde that's clinging to the cans then pour over salsa verde.  The amount of water is not an exact science but you want enough water to cover the pork when you're done.
5. Plug in slow cooker turn on low and let it cook for 12-18 hours to let it brown nicely.  (It is "done" and safe to eat after 8 hours but the flavor is so much more intense after 12-18 hours that's how we cook it.).
6. Using a couple of forks shred the pork after 6-8 hours.
7. Serve over brown rice (or white rice or noodles or in tortillas --   The possibilities are endless.  You can get some inspiration from http://www.cozi.com/live-simply/recipes/salsa-verde-pork-burrito-bowls.  This is what we started with but we don't bother with all the rest of that.).,

instructions, 1. Cut meat into 2 inch pieces
2. In a large stock pot or hot crockpot put oil garlic and onion cook until lightly browned then add enough of the meat to cover bottom and brown the meat on all sides. Remove and do remaining meat as well.
3. Return meat to pot after browned and put enough water to JUST cover the meat you do not want a lot of water in the pot.
4. In a small frying pan fry the jalapeño until skin is lightly blackened on all sides then wrap in a cold hand towel to sweat the skin. I usually wet a wash cloth and put it in the freezer when I begin frying the jalapeños.
5. In a small pot boil the tomatillos for about 20 minutes or until they are very soft almost watery feeling. The skin should just slide off.
6. Remove the skin of the jalapeño and slice open removing the seeds and top. Smash in a mortar stone or in a blender or food processor until it becomes a paste.
7. Repeat these steps for the tomatillos I usually just squish them by hand into the pot since they are so soft after you remove the filmy skin. Only put in the softest parts.
8. Add jalapeño and tomatillo to pot. Also add cumin salt and pepper to taste.
9. Cook on medium heat about 4 to 6 hours or in a crock pot.
10. Once meat is soft and shreds easily make a thin paste from the flour and pour it into the pot and gently mix into the juices. This will thicken the juices into a thin gravy.
11. You can serve this with red rice and refried beans or in burritos with mozzarella cheese.,

4. Divide the mixture into four and shape into burgers. If you have time cover and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes to let the flavours blend.
5. Place a sheet of foil over the barbecue or grill or use a baking sheet if preferred- because these burgers are made from a low fat meat they can break up if not handled carefully so the foil helps them to stay together. Handle and flip them with care.
6. Place the burgers on the barbecue or under a grill on the foil or baking sheet.
7. Cook for 15 minutes flipping regularly.
8. If using a barbecue remove the foil at this point- after 15 minutes- so the burgers pick up the chargrilled flavour in the next 10 minutes.
9. Cook for a further 10 minutes (whether using a barbeque or a grill) or until completely cooked through.

instructions, 1. Mayonnaise  --  In a small bowl add the green chilies mayonnaise garlic and lime juice and mix well.  If you want you can blend this in a small food processor or blender but I actually like a little texture to mine.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. This can easily be made ahead of time.
2. Burgers  --  In a medium size bowl add the salsa chili powder cumin grated onion (and yes grate the onion right over the bowl the juice is important) pinch of salt and pepper. If you use a mild salsa you can add a bit more chili powder but I use a medium heat salsa which works just fine for this.  Mix everything well. Then add in the turkey and mix lightly I prefer to use my hands; and make sure not to over work the burgers.
3. Make 4 nice size burgers and place on a small sheet pan lined with either foil or parchment.  Make a small indentation in the center of the burger with your thumb. Not too deep just a little indent; this helps the burger not to shrink up as it grills.  Season with salt and pepper and put in the freezer. We are not freezing them just firming them up. They cook better after they rest a bit and are chilled. About 15-20 minutes in the freezer. These also can be made a head of time.
4. Garnish  --  Prepare your avocado slices and drizzle with the remaining lime juice (just so they doesn't brown) lettuce leaves and cheese.
5. Grill  --  I prefer an outside grill but a inside grill pan or even a heavy saute pan will work just fine. Spray the pan or grill with a non stick spray and cook the burgers on the first side until you get a nice sear and golden brown depending on how thick you make them about 5 minutes.  Flip and make sure when you flip the burger releases from the pan or grill easily. If you have to scrape to flip it it isn't ready to be flipped. The second side again will take about 5 minutes maybe a bit less.  Add 2 slices of cheese per burger and melt.  As the cheese melts add the burger rolls either to a broiler or grill to lightly brown.
6. Finish  --  Top the bottom bun with a thin slather of the mayonnaise then a lettuce leaf;  then the burger with melted cheese another lettuce leaf avocado slices and top with the second bun slathered with the mayonnaise.
7. Serve  --  ENJOY! A crisp green salad goes great with this; fries of course or chips and a pickle.,

instructions, 1. In a small pot bring some water to a boil and add the chiles. Turn off the heat and let the chiles steep until they are pliable.
2. Take the chiles out of the hot water and remove stems and seeds. Add them to a blender and add the 1/2 cup of pineapple juice. Blend for a few minutes until very smooth and pass through a fine mesh sieve. It will be a bit thick so use a spatula or spoon and keep stirring the mixture against the sieve.
3. Pour this pineapple-chilies mixture back into the blender or food processor and add cumin oregano garlic achiote paste 1 tablespoon of white vinegar and 1 tablespoon of salt and blend until smooth.
4. In a large bowl or dish slather thick marinade between layers of pork and add the sliced onions in between placing each new layer of pork directly on top of each other. Cover with plastic wrap and let it marinade in the refrigerator for one hour (and no more because those pineapple enzymes are powerful!).
5. In a very large skillet heat it on high heat until it is scorching hot. Sprinkle a little more salt on both sides of the meat. Sear the pork for 1-2 minutes on each side. Throw in the onions that was in your marinade as well. Your pork should have enough fat on it so you won’t need any additional oil but if it doesn't add just a little to your pan. Sear off all of the pork and then dice them roughly into 1/2 inch cubes.
6. Return the diced meat into the pan in batches (don’t crowd your pan) and cook the meat until it gets nice and brown about 10 minutes.
7. Add all the marinating onions and some pineapple slices in your pan grill or griddle so they become caramelized.
8. Heat some small tortillas on the pan or griddle.
9. To assemble your tacos place two tortillas and pile a little meat on top. Add some onions and cilantro maybe some tomatillo salsa and some grilled pineapple if you so desire.,

instructions, 1. Purée tomatoes onion and garlic with water and 3/4 tsp salt in a blender until smooth. Strain through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl pressing on and then discarding solids.
2. Heat 1/4 cup oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Add tomato mixture (it will spatter) and simmer over low heat stirring occasionally until thickened slightly and a pool of oil forms around bubbles about 20 minutes. Stir in enough of boiling-hot water to reach the consistency of a thin broth. Season with salt. Keep warm over low heat.
3. While sauce simmers slit 1 side of each chile lengthwise and remove seeds and veins keeping chiles intact. Fill each chile first with about 3 Tbsp packed Oaxaca cheese and then with about 2 Tbsp queso añejo and close chiles around filling as well as possible.
4. Put flour in a wide bowl and carefully dredge chiles in flour (make sure filling doesn't fall out) gently knocking off excess and reserve on a plate.
5. Heat remaining cup oil in a 12-inch heavy nonstick skillet over medium heat until it shimmers.
6. Meanwhile beat egg whites with a pinch of salt using an electric mixer at medium-high speed until they just hold soft peaks. Beat yolks briefly to loosen then fold into whites with a rubber spatula gently but thoroughly.
7. Working in batches of 3 dip floured chiles one by one in egg batter to coat transferring to skillet. Fry chiles turning once with a slotted spoon until batter is golden all over about 1 minute. Transfer chiles as fried to warm tomato broth turning to coat then let stand 2 minutes so they absorb some of broth. Serve chiles with broth.
8. Note: Look for chiles that are soft and pliable enough not to need soaking.
9. Chiles can be stuffed and coated with flour 1 day ahead and chilled.
10. Tomato broth can be made 1 day ahead and chilled (covered once cool). Bring to a bare simmer before frying chiles.,

instructions, 1. For the shredded beef:
2. Put the beef lime juice orange juice chili powder cumin salt coriander and garlic in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot and add just enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook covered for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and continue cooking on a gentle simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours stirring occasionally.
3. Once the beef is tender let it cool slightly in the braising liquid and then shred with two forks while still in the pot so as to let all the shredded beef soak up the delicious sauce.
4. For the tomatillo guacamole:
5. Combine the cilantro tomatillos garlic avocado jalapeno onion lime juice cumin and salt in a food processor or blender and pulse until combined.
6. For the sopes:
7. Combine the masa harina flour baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and slowly add the warm water while incorporating the dry ingredients using a stiff spatula. Once the dough comes together transfer it to a floured surface and knead it by hand until it is smooth and not crumbly about 5 minutes.
8. Roll the dough to 1/4-inch thickness and then cut it into 2-inch circles with a biscuit cutter or the rim of a glass; you should get 36 circles. Re-roll and re-cut scraps of dough until all of it is used. Create a ridge around the edge of each sope using your thumb and working from the center outwards. You are trying to make a small well for the toppings to rest in once the dough is fried.
9. Fill a cast-iron skillet with 1 1/2 inches of vegetable oil and heat to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot fry the sopes until their edges are crispy and just starting to brown about 3 minutes. Flip and cook for another 3 minutes. Transfer the sopes to a paper-towel-lined plate and season with salt as they come out of the oil.
10. For the toppings:
11. Melt the butter in a skillet then add the refried beans. Stir to warm through and loosen the mixture. Set aside. Mix the pickled jalapenos and tomatoes and set them aside.
12. Fill each sope with a layer of beans followed by some shredded beef and a little tomatillo guacamole. Top each with some of the cabbage tomato-jalapeno mixture crema cotija and cilantro.,

instructions, 1. *Note: it may take one or two attempts to cook the cheese just right. Keep trying!
2. In a small bowl grate cheese and set aside.
3. Heat a non-stick pan over medium-high heat until it becomes very warm to the touch.
4. Sprinkle the shredded cheese of choice onto the surface of the pan spreading out the cheese to the approximate diameter of the tortilla.
5. When the cheese starts to melt lay the tortilla on top of the cheese and press it down into the melting cheese (this helps the tortilla to adhere.).
6. Let the tortilla sit undisturbed in the pan for approximately 30 seconds. Gently test around the edges by sliding a wide spatula under the tortilla. Lift tortilla slightly to check if the cheese has turned golden and is sticking to the tortilla.
7. Once the cheese has stuck slide the spatula completely under the tortilla and flip it over to brown the other side.
8. Slide tortilla onto a platter.
9. If desired top with your favorite quesadilla fillings like guacamole shredded lettuce salsa black olives sour cream etc.,

instructions, 1. In a small saucepan mash the beans lightly. Stir in 1/3 cup salsa. Heat over low heat. Cover and keep warm while making egg "tortillas."
2. In a medium bowl combine eggs milk pepper and salt. Coat a 10-inch nonstick omelet pan (or skillet with flared sides) with nonstick cooking spray or brush lightly with a little cooking oil. Preheat pan over medium heat until a drop of water sizzles.
3. For each of the egg "tortillas" pour about 1/4 cup of the egg mixture into the pan. Lift and tilt pan to spread egg mixture over bottom. Return to heat. Cook for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned on bottom (don't turn).
4. Loosen edges of the egg "tortilla" with spatula; carefully slide out onto a serving plate browned side down.
5. On one half of the "tortilla" spread one-fourth of the bean-salsa mixture. Top with tomato and cheese. Fold in half and then into quarters to form the burritos. Keep warm while preparing remaining tortillas and burritos.
6. Top with a dollop of sour cream and the remaining cheese; sprinkle with mint. Serve with additional salsa if desired. Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Prepare 10 pint jarslids and pressure canner . Start warming the jars (I do this in an otherwise empty dishwasher running with no detergent.).
2. Mix up the spice mix and set aside. It makes approximately 1 1/4 cups of mix.
3. In batches brown the onions and ground beef. You will want a large stockpot for the final mixing. I used a 13qt and an 8 qt pot to cook the meat and then finished off in the 13qt pot. Drain the beef if desired.
4. Combine the beef/onions canned chiles spice mix and two pints of the tomato juice. There should be just enough juice to help the spices mix into the meat and start to create a sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings to your taste. Keep on low heat stirring occasionally.
5. In a separate saucepan begin simmering the rest of the tomato sauce. This will be the liquid used to top off the jars. If you have not already done so begin warming the lids as well.
6. One at a time fill the jars with the meat mixture leaving 1 inch headspace. Pour a small amount (about 1/4 cup?) of tomato juice into the jar and use a chop stick or other thin implement to make sure the liquid forces out all the bubbles. Readjust headspace if needed. Wipe the jar with a paper towel dipped in vinegar then put the lid and ring on. Put directly into canner then continue with the next jar until all the jars are filled.
7. Process as per your canner instructions. You should vent for 10 minutes and if at sea level --  the processing time is 75 minutes for pints and 90 minutes for quarts with 10 pounds of pressure.
8. If you cannot fit 10 pints into your canner or are not ready for such a big batch I have also done this with 5 pounds of meat. I used 2/3 cup of the taco seasoning and probably 2 onions. The yield was 6 pints.
9. I have a family of two adults and two small children and one pint is plenty for one meal. We even have leftovers sometimes.,

5. Don't even think about putting the avocado pit in the guac to keep it green it's not going to work.
6. What works is the lime juice in the guac and the plastic wrap on the guac to keep out the air.
7. Even after 24 hours the guac is not going to be a gorgeous green but no one will care it will taste delicious anyway and have another 5 layers of stuff over it.
8. Other layers: In a large straight-sided glass dish spread the bean layer across the bottom.
9. Spread half the tomatoes over the bean layer.
10. Spread the guacamole over the chopped tomatoes.

instructions, 1. In a large pot bring 3 quarts of water to a rolling boil.
2. Peel or scrub the potatoes. Carefully add to the boiling water. Add the salt.
3. Boil until soft but not too soft. We don't want them to fall apart when we mix in the dressing. 15-20 minutes should do it for small-medium sized potatoes.
4. Drain and set aside to cool.
5. After they have cooled cut into small bitesized pieces about a 1/2 dice and place in a large bowl.
6. In another bowl mix the sour cream mayo diced jalapenos green onions and cilantro if using. (If you prefer add the dressing ingredients to your food processor and pulse until smooth.).
7. Pour dressing over the potatoes and gently toss to coat.  (actually I've found that after the intial toss putting a tight fitting lid on the bowl and inverting it a couple of times mixes the salad pretty well without breaking up the potatoes.).
8. Garnish with parsley and/or cilanto and/or grape tomatoes.

cuisine, Latin American >> Mexican >> Mexican, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Roasting Hatch Chiles:
2. Medium or mild chiles are better suited than hot which can ruin the harmony and smother other flavors.
3. Begin by washing and drying well.
4. Place chiles on a hot grill and roast about 3 minutes until the skin begins to blister turn with tongs and blister the other side. The key is blistering the skin without cooking the chile. Continue until the chiles are generously blistered on all sides.
5. Place in a plastic bag (or covered cassarole dish) seal and allow to sweat for about 5 minutes. Sweating loosens the blistered skin.
6. Ignore advice to place chiles under running water to peel. Although easy the water also washes away the smoky flavor. Simply use your fingers to remove the skin and seeds.
7. Slice into strips instead of small pieces which provide more color and bolder flavor.
8. STEW:
9. Season the pork with salt and pepper.
10. Heat a large skillet or Dutch oven on high.
11. Add a thin layer of canola or vegetable oil but not olive oil which conflicts with the green chiles.
12. When oil is hot on the brink of smoking add a small batch of pork chunks.
13. Do not crowd. And if you add the pork too early it will absorb too much of the oil.
14. Allow pork to saute for a few minutes before turning with tongs to prevent the meat from sticking to the pan.
15. Properly searing the meat seals in the juices and flavors.
16. Once the first batch is done remove with a slotted spoon.
17. Add more oil if necessary then put in the remaining pork.
18. After all the pieces are properly seared remove from pan drain excess oil and set aside.
19. Add small amount of oil to frying pan and saute garlic and onions until tender about 5 minutes.
20. Fill a large pot with about 1 quart water and add boullion cube.
21. Bring to a boil.
22. Add tomatillos and cilantro.
23. Boil about 5 minutes or until tomatillos are soft.
24. Drain off the water (saving 1 cup for stew).
25. Using blender or food processor puree the vegetables. Aim for a consistency similar to a light gravy.
26. Add pork and onion mixture to puree and bring to a boil.
27. Reduce heat to medium-low add the roasted chiles and simmer for 45 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the pork is tender.  Add the saved water as needed.
28. Do not cook in the oven; which causes the pork to dry out and shred. The chunks of pork should remain intact.
29. Spoon stew into bowls and top with a light sprinkling of shredded cheese and serve with lime slices and tortillas.,

instructions, 1. Rice  --  Cook the rice according to the package directions (You can use any rice you want) I often use a boil in bag for convenience. I have also made this with leftover Chinese rice too.
2. Turkey  --  As the rice cooks brown the turkey in a medium size pan. I love non stick for this dish. Add the olive oil to the non stick pan on medium to medium high heat and brown the turkey breaking it up as it cooks. Cook until it is no longer pink. Remove the turkey to a plate lined with a paper towel to absorb any extra oil. Set this to the side. Keep any drippings in the pan to saute the vegetables.
3. Vegetables  --  Keep the heat on medium high heat and add the red pepper green pepper onion and garlic and saute until the peppers become soft. It should take around 3-4 minutes.
4. Beans and Seasoning  --  Add the taco seasoning and water (start with 1/4 cup water you can always add more)  to the vegetables and stir well to combine. Add the beans and corn and mix well.
5. Turkey  --  Add the turkey back in along with the scallions cilantro and the cooked rice.
6. Finish  --  Reduce the heat to medium low. Remove the pan to the side and add the sour cream and stir inches Return to the heat just to warm up. It will only take a minute.
7. Serve  --  Garnish with grated cheese avocado black olives tomatoes or anything you want. A few nacho chips are also great served with this.,

instructions, 1. Make the sauce. This can be done 1-2 days in advance and the sauce reheated just before making the Chilies Rellenos.
2. In a large skillet sauté the onions and serrano and chipotle peppers over medium high heat in the melted butter and olive oil.
3. Just as the onions are ready to brown sprinkle the Wondra flour over it and allow to sauté for about five minutes stirring occasionally -- the onions/peppers should be fairly dry at the end of this process.
4. Slowly add the chicken broth and whisk into a gravy. Add the chili powder sugar and salt.
5. When the mix begins to boil add the tomato sauce and whisk.
6. When the mix re-boils for a second time reduce heat.
7. (You can add additional chicken broth and whisk over low heat at this point to achieve desired thickness.) Set aside or refrigerate if you aren't making the Chilies Rellenos right away.
8. Now prepare the peppers: Place the peppers in an ungreased 9x13-inch ungreased casserole dish and place them under the broiler using the top rack of the oven. The objective is to char the peppers that they become mostly blackened.
9. Keep a close eye on the peppers under the broiler. As they blacken you will hear them make popping sounds. Once they are pretty much charred on one side (some will be more so than others) remove the dish and turn the peppers. Place them back under the broiler until the second side is charred.
10. Once the peppers are pretty well charred remove them from the oven and immediately wrap each one in a damp paper towel which will serve to loosen the charred skin.
11. After five minutes or so remove the paper towels and pull the skin from each pepper with your fingers or use a paring knife to gently scrape off the skin. Do not be concerned if some skin remains attached -- this does not affect the quality of the dish. Repeat until all the peppers are skinned.
12. Now is the best time to pour your corn oil into a large skillet and allow it to heat to 375 degrees F. on the stove top.
13. Back to the peppers carefully cut a slit into each skinned pepper from about 1" from the tip to fairly close to the stem. Then cut in a small perpendicular cut on the stem end to form an elongated "T". Carefully remove as many seeds as possible from each pepper.
14. Once the peppers are de-seeded gently stuff them with the shredded room-temperature Monterey Jack cheese. When finished each pepper should appear close to its original girth -- you do not want them to gape open at the seam. Set them aside for the moment.
15. Next prepare the tempura batter by pouring 1 1/2 cups of ICE COLD water into a mixing bowl (or into the bowl of your Kitchen Aide mixer with whisk attachment) and begin running the beater or blender as you pour in the tempura batter mix. Blend only just until any large lumps have disappeared (10-20 seconds). Don't worry about small lumps.
16. Cradle each pepper in your fingers as not to open the seam and submerge it into the batter coating as evenly as possible (this is a messy operation!).
17. As each pepper is battered place it directly into the hot oil in the skillet seam side DOWN. Do not crowd the peppers -- I like to fry no more than 3 at one time.
18. Turn each pepper one time so that both sides end up a light golden brown (the seam will be sealed shut at this point) which is about 3-5 minutes per side.
19. Plate up the peppers directly from the skillet on to serving platters/plates. Two peppers make a large serving. Generously pour heated Ranchera sauce over each of the plated peppers.
20. Topping with additional cheese is optional. Serve with rice as a side dish if you wish.,

2. Roughly chop the chocolate and melt in a medium sauce pan together with milk and cream (over medium heat).  After the chocolate has melted whisk in the cocoa powder avoiding clumps.  Add the vanilla bean and seeds.  Bring the mix to just under a boil (150° on a candy thermometer) stirring frequently.  Remove from heat and let the mix steep covered for 30 minutes to an hour.
3. Remove the vanilla bean.  Reheat mix over moderate heat until hot (150 degrees) stirring frequently.
4. Whisk the eggs sugar and salt together in a small bowl.
5. Temporarily remove the pan from the heat.  Add 1/2 cup hot cream mixture to the eggs/sugar in a slow stream whisking constantly. Whisk the egg/cream mix back into the saucepan and return to medium-low heat STIRRING CONSTANTLY until a candy thermometer reads 170 degrees (do not let it boil).
6. In a medium to large bowl (that cream mixture will be chilled in) combine the cinnamon and cayenne pepper.  Pour a small amount of the chocolate cream through a strainer into the bowl and whisk to combine avoiding clumps.  Pour the remaining chocolate cream mixture through the strainer and whisk to combine.
7. Cool completely in the refrigerator (at least 4 hours).  Freeze in an ice cream maker. Transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden.
8. Notes: DO NOT add more than 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper.  The flavor intensifies as it freezes in the ice cream maker.  If you don’t have 1/8 tsp use 1/4 tsp and remove half the cayenne.
9. Notes: To chill more quickly place the final mixture in an ice and cold-water bath for 30 minutes (a larger bowl for the ice water a smaller bowl filled with the cream mixture that will sit in the "bath"). Stir frequently.,

3. In another medium bowl mix the chipotle the remaining 2 tablespoon oil 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoons pepper.
4. Trim the chicken. If the tenderloins are still attached remove them and save for another use. Use the flat side of a meat mallet to pound each chicken breast to an even 1/2-inch thickness. Add the chicken to the chipotle mixture and toss well to coat.
5. When the grill is ready lay the chicken on the hot grill grates and cook covered until the chicken has grill marks and the edges turn opaque 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the breasts and continue to cook until the chicken is cooked through 2 to 3 minutes more.

2. Finely mince a handful of cilantro. I've never measured cilantro in my life so I don't know how many tablespoons it is but maybe close to half a cup.  Add cilantro and mix.
3. Add 1/4 cup of finely chopped red onion and mix. The reason your mixing every time is to further mash the avocado and of course to mix the flavors.
4. Start boiling a small pot of water.  Split jalapeno into quarters and remove the seeds.  Finely chop the jalapeno add and mix.  Slit an X in the bottom of your tomato and dip in boiling water for 30-45 seconds and immediately place under cold running water.  Remove skin starting at your X.
5. Slice tomato into 8ths and remove seeds.  Dice and place into bowl and mix.  Slice lime in two against the grain and drain using salad fork. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9VN1dVosjw.
6. Mix in salt and pepper cover and refrigerate for 20-30 minutes.  I know some people say to eat guacamole right after prep but the ingredients need time to marinate.  Remove and enjoy with tortilla chips.,

2. Cilantro is to taste but we usually use about a handful from the garden leaving out the stems. If it's out of season an entire fresh pack from the grocer will do the trick. Chop and add to the mix.
3. Cumin is an acquired taste from what I've been told but we love it. Again put in as much or as little as you want but we usually add about 3 tablespoons.
4. You'll just about double the amount of salsa that you had if you use the larger 2 1/2 cup size jars that are available at the grocer.

instructions, 1. 1. Preheat oven to 375*F. Grease an 8 inch square pan.
2. 2. Melt butter in large skillet. Remove from heat and stir in sugar. Quickly add eggs and beat until well blended. Combine buttermilk with baking soda and stir into mixture in pan. Stir in cornmeal flour and salt until well blended and few lumps remain. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
3. 3. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
4. My Note:    Just wanted to mention a few things in response to. First I mix all ingredients in the pan I melt the butter inches Less dishes. Second I often use whole wheat flour to cut sweetness and make it a tad more healthy. Third it freezes fabulously. I always make a double batch remove one from the pan after cooling wrap it up and pop it in the freezer. Based on some I want to clarify something. I use a regular pot to melt my butter inches After the butter has melted I proceed with adding the rest of the ingredients in that same pot. I do NOT get a separate bowl for mixing inches After all the ingredients are mixed in the pot I pour the batter into a baking pan. I do NOT mix everything in the pan I'm baking it inches I do NOT keep the butter and sugar mixture out when mixing the rest of the ingredients. Hope that helps. 7/24/08 I'd change the recipe if I could but I can't figure out how so I'll mention here that the normal baking time is 30 minutes. I put 30-40 minutes in the directions because it takes longer when you use whole wheat flour which I often do. I'm guessing those who complain about it being dry are just seeing the "cook time - 40 minutes" at the top and overbaking it.
5. 11/24/12 I tweaked it a bit. I reduced the sugar a little but think it would be fine for the full amount if you like your cornbread a little sweet. I used powdered buttermilk and water and added 2/3 Celsius fresh yellow corn. In my opinion the ONLY way to cook cornbread is in a preheated cast iron skillet. It gives it such a wonderful buttery crisp crust. I greased my 9 inches skillet with vegetable oil and put it in the oven while I assembled the recipe. When the batter was finished I poured it into the hot skillet. I then baked it for 25 minutes. The result was top notch. Very moist with perfect texture.
6. You had dry bread --  1/4 lb not 1/4 cup butter! This might have made a difference if you read it wrong 1/4 lb. is 1/2 cup of butter. Also I put it in my greased preheated iron skillet for 25 minute !
7. The recipe is fantastic as written but after making this recipe a few hunder times I made a few changes. I used Splenda instead of sugar whole-wheat flour instead of all-purpose Smart Balance Light instead of butter and sour skim milk instead of buttermilk. Sounds like a lot of substitutions but the end result was absolutely delicious and nearly guilt free! This is the ONLY cornbread recipe that I use and it comes out wonderful every time.,

instructions, 1. 1) Soak beans in a large pot covered (quick soak method: bring to boil then turn off the heat leave covered for 1 1/2 hours).
2. 2) Drain beans and refill pot with fresh water cover bring to a boil again simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Drain again and let cool at room temperature for at least 5-10 minutes (don't worry about using warm water we aren't worried about keeping the beans in tact).
3. 3) About halfway through the cook time for the beans start cooking the brown rice. Add 4 cups of water and 2 cups rice to a pot covered. Bring to a boil then simmer for 30-40 minutes (or as directed on package).
4. 4) Combine all seasonings and breadcrumbs in a large bowl (I combined the seasoning in one bowl to mix it then divided it between 3 large bowls to prepare for the large amount of food this makes).
5. 5) Once both the rice and beans have cooled enough to be able to mix by hand combine the beans and rice (I found that the large pot I used for the beans had enough room to add and mix up the rice).
6. 6) Combine all of the dry seasoning with the beans and rice mixture (or if you split the seasoning up between multiple bowls split up equal amounts of the bean and rice mixture into each bowl).
7. 7) Start mashing! I start off using a potato masher but always end up using my hands to get the beans and rice mashed up enough. Slowly add the picante sauce until you get the right texture for you (I prefer at least 2 pounds in this recipe use less for a tougher/dryer mix).,

instructions, 1. In a saucepan saute the diced onions and fresh chilies over medium heat in the butter until onions are soft and transparent.
2. Add flour and stir/scrape the bottom to prevent sticking.  Cook for several minutes to remove the raw flour taste from the roux.
3. Whisk in the heated half and half until the sauce has thickened (will coat the back of a spoon).
4. Add the dried cumin Mexican oregano and drained green chilies and stir to combine.
5. Add the cheese and stir over medium heat until the cheese has fully melted.  Don't use your whisk or the cheese will create a gooey mess in the whisk wires.  I use as much Monterey jack cheese as necessary to bring the Queso to the desired consistency.
6. Once the cheese has melted add the cilantro corn jalepenos and lime juice if desired.  These ingredients are not mandatory but add a great deal of depth to the Queso.
7. We like to serve this over tortilla chips with thinly-sliced marinated flank steak or chicken breast and diced tomatoes.,

2. Scallops  --  20-30 tops.
3. Fish can go a couple of hours especially cod or halibut a thick cut fish steak.
4. Marinade  --  Mix the orange juice lemon zest of both the orange and lemon and chipoltes.  Just mix all in a baggie and let the seafood marinade.
5. Shrimp  --  Now I like to skewer mine (bamboo skewers soaked in water first if using a charcoal grill) and then just grill.  They take hardly any time.  Just a couple of minutes per side is all.  Just until they turn pink.  I baste them as they grill once per side with the marinade.  You can do this inside on a grill pan or outside on the grill.
6. Serve  --  With creamy cheesy polenta and grilled vegetables.,

instructions, 1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion peppers and garlic stirring frequently about 3 - 4 minutes remove to a small bowl and set aside.
2. Add ground beef to the same skillet breaking it into pieces and saute until no longer pink; drain off excess fat if desired; add chili powder (or chili seasoning mix) and reserved sauteed vegetables; stir well to combine.
3. Add V8 juice (or tomato juice if using) undrained kidney beans oregano cumin salt and rice; stir well and bring to a boil. Lower heat to maintain a simmer cover and simmer for about 25 minutes until rice is cooked. (check half way through making sure mixture is not sticking add a little water if necessary).
4. Stir in corn and olives; cover and cook for 5 more minutes.
5. Sprinkle cheese on top and cover just until the cheese is melted.
6. NOTE: This recipe is very forgiving it's hard to mess it up.  I usually adjust the seasonings according to how much ground beef I am using  You can add more or less spices to suit your taste substitute black beans for kidney beans. more onion less peppers a jalapeno etc --   Just make sure you add enough juice to cook the rice (you may want to check after about 10 - 15 minutes and if needed add some more juice or water).  The above measurements work well for 1 pound of ground beef.  I tend to use the larger measure of spices (sometimes more) it just depends on your taste. It makes a great filling for burritos.,

instructions, 1. Cut the peel from the eggplant and cut into approximate 1/2 to 3/4 inch strips.  Add them a handful at a time to a colander salting them well between layers until all of them are in the colander.  Set aside for 30 minutes to allow them to "sweat" their bitterness out and lose liquid.
2. While the eggplant is in the colander make the sauce.  In a large heavy pot (I use my Le Creuset) heat the olive oil.  Add the onion and sauté until just translucent.  Add the garlic and chiles stir well and sauté stirring occasionally for an additional 7-10 minutes until onion is soft.
3. Add the tomatoes and stir well.  Sauté stirring occasionally for 10-15 minutes and the liquids are reduced by about half.
4. Rinse the salted eggplant and drain well.
5. Add all the remaining ingredients (including eggplant) to the pot stir well and cover.  Cook for 15-20 minutes until eggplant is well-cooked and the sauce is the consistency that you like (you may want to remove the cover for the last 5 minutes to reduce the sauce a bit).  Remove bay leaves.
6. Serve with polenta rounds or squares (or some other favorite method of prepared polenta) drizzled with a little crema.  Enjoy!,

2. Sauce:
3. Take care when finely mincing the Habeneros (use gloves or a plastic bag to cover your hands).  After cutting them open you can scrape out the pith and seeds for a little less fire.
4. Saute the onions on medium heat in half the butter till translucent.  Add in the garlic habaneros and the rest of the butter.  Saute for about 5 more minutes.  In the meantime slice off some of the skin of the limes and super finely mince.  Add all the lime juice and softer parts of the lime pulp and the minced lime zest.  Let this simmer until it is thick (5 more minutes).  Now add in the honey and let this simmer until it gets thick again (about 5-10 minutes).
5. Now put in small food processor and saucify it.  Fridge it overnight.
6. When making the wings do it however you prefer.  Bake 20 mintues at 500 degrees or deep fry em first then bake.  If you like before baking mix the dragon wing sauce with equal parts Franks.  Franks lends a nice color and some flavor and dilutes the fire of the Dragon sauce.,

instructions, 1. Roast whole poblanos: place on cookie sheet at 400 degrees. Bake for ~20 minutes until the peppers are deflated & the skins are charred in spots. Place cooked peppers in a bowl with a top & cool (this will loosen the skin & make the peppers easy to handle). When cool peel off the outer membrane of the peppers along with the stem and seeds.
2. Puree: Place all ingredients in a blender & puree until smooth. Add salt to taste.
3. Pour mixture into baking pan. Stir in 3/4 of the cheese. Sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Cover and bake at 350 for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake another 10-15 minutes until the cheese on top is bubbling & slightly golden.
4. You can make the sauce ahead of time and keep in the fridge for a few days. If you do this the baking time will be reduced. This is because of the onions; they add a sharpness that needs to be mellowed (baking does this as does resting time in the fridge). If the sauce rests in the fridge for a few days the baking time is ~ 25 minutes + an additional 10-15. If you bake it the day you make the sauce it will need the stated longer time.
5. Poblanos vary in spiciness from fairly mild to medium spicy. You won't know until the puree is done. If you want a spicier sauce simply roast a few jalapeños along with the poblanos and add them to the puree.
6. At Chihuahua (Tucson AZ) this sauce is served over shrimp & fish. If you wish to do this simply saute the fish or shrimp until just barely done. Then toss with the puree. Top with some mozzarella and bake until the top is bubbling & golden.,

instructions, 1. For the batter - Combine all dry ingredients together in a bowl deep enough to cover the fish once placed in it. Whisk the egg in a separate bowl and add it to the dry ingredients. Add the water slowly as needed until the batter is loose enough to work with but still thick enough to cover the fish when coated. (It should cover a spoon when held in the air but not much batter should be dripping off of the spoon.).
2. For frying the fish - add the canola oil to a deep pot (2-3 inches of oil) and set it to medium-high heat. Let the oil preheat for about 5 minutes. Slice each tilapia fillet in thirds (or whatever size you think makes sense for a taco) and drop it into the batter. Make sure the fish pieces are fully covered in batter. Place fish gently into the frying pot to avoid oil splatter; do not overcrowd the pot. After about 4 minutes or until golden brown flip the fish. After golden brown on both sides and about 10 minutes in the pot rest the fish on paper towel to dry. Turn the heat down to medium and repeat the batter/frying/drying process.
3. For the red pepper pesto - In a blender add solid ingredients first: garlic cloves roasted red peppers fresh basil. Add wet ingredients next: greek yogurt olive oil. Blend at medium speed to incorporate. Add dry ingredients last: pepper and cheese. Blend at medium speed until combined. Taste and season with more pepper as needed.
4. To assemble - layer two pieces of  lettuce for each taco to help give it a solid base. Add 2-3 small pieces of fish per taco and 3-4 slices of avocado per taco. Drizzle the red pepper pesto on top and hold each taco together with toothpicks for easy handling.,

2. Place chiles in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap allow to steam 15 minutes. While chiles are steaming make tomato sauce.
3. Tomato Sauce: Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add onion and garlic and cook only until the onion is soft. Add pureed tomatoes and chicken broth bring to a boil reduce heat and simmer over low heat while you finish the rest of the recipe.
4. Remove charred peels from chiles.
5. I use two different methods for removing the seeds depending on the type of chile. Anaheim- Slice off the top 1/2 inch of chile on the stem end (horizontally) removing the seed placenta and any loose seeds with your fingers. Poblano- Carefully slit each chile lengthwise along one side; remove seeds and veins (you may find it easier to use the paring knife to cut out the seeds and then remove them with your fingers).
6. Fill each chile with several strips of cheese roll in flour and set aside.
7. Beat egg whites until stiff; slightly beat yolks and fold into whites.
8. Heat oil in a large skillet to 360F-400°F.
9. Dip floured chile into the egg batter and spoon batter over to coat chile entirely.
10. Slide chile into hot oil. Fry for a few minutes on underside while spooning hot oil over the top. Turn and cook again until both sides are golden. Remove to a paper towel to drain.
11. You can serve the chiles now by placing 1/6 of the sauce on the plate and laying the chile on top and garnish with sour cream and cilantro or --.
12. Carefully place the rellenos into the tomato sauce and simmer gently to heat thoroughly (about 15 minutes). Do not cook too long or batter will begin to break away.
13. Serve with some of the sauce and garnish with a dab of sour cream and a few cilantro leaves.,

instructions, 1. Place all of the marinade ingredients except for the steak into a food processor and buzz them up.  Then pour the mixture over the steak in a non-reactive container and marinade for about 15 minutes.  Any longer and the acid from the lime juice will cook your steak for you!
2. Meanwhile prepare the sauce by buzzing the fire roasted tomatoes jalepeno garlic vinegar sugar cilantro and salt & pepper in your food processor until you have a fine consistency.
3. Place this mixture in a pot over medium heat and cook for about 20 minutes stiring constantly to make sure the tomatoes don't burn.
4. Grill the steak over high heat to your desired doneness (skirt steak is exceedingly thin so 2 minutes a side on my gas grill was about medium rare).  It all depends on your heat so since you're the cook you decide!
5. Top the steak with the sauce and serve.
6. Optionally to do it exactly like they do at El Torito go ahead and roll the jack cheese inside a corn tortilla (which has been softened in a little bit of hot oil for 5 seconds) which you have baked just until the cheese melts.  Place this enchilada on top of the steak before you spoon on the sauce.

instructions, 1. Stab the roast several times with knife and insert the garlic cloves into cuts so the garlic flavors the roast while cooking.
2. Heat the cooker to medium high heat add the 1 tbsp cooking oil and sear the roast on all sides about 30 seconds a side.
3. Pour the chili verde over the roast.  Lift the roast a bit so some of the chili verde gets under it while cooking.
4. Add the Jalepeno pepper (optional) or Chipotle pepper (optional) along with the quartered onion.
5. Cook on high pressure for 1 hour.
6. Remove from heat and cool the cooker under cool water till the pressure is gone.
7. With tongs remove the roast to a large baking pan and shred with forks thoroughly.
8. Pour whats left in the pressure cooker through a strainer and dump the contents of the strainer over the shredded meat evenly.
9. You can save the liquid from the pressure cooker to flavor the meat later if you want.
10. Spread out the shredded meat out evenly and broil it on the middle oven rack untill edges start to get a little crispy brown.
11. Stir the meat around and heat again till edges get a little crispy brown.
12. Careful not to dry it out too much.  Remember crispy an succulent.
13. I find this is the best way to heat up corn tortillas:
14. Heat up a griddle to med high.
15. Dip a corn tortilla in cold water and then place it on griddle till it gets a couple toasty brown spots. Flip the tortilla and remove after the other side gets toasty brown spots too then remove and stack.
16. Repeat till you have enough for everyone.
17. Serve the Carnitas with the Beans to be eaten with the tortillas.
18. You can also serve with rice and have some hot sauce or Pico de Gallo handy.,

instructions, 1. Roasting the Chilies.
2. To roast the chilies you can use a gas or charcoal grill a broiler or a stovetop burner anything that will provide intense heat.  Roast the chilies until the skin separates from the meat of the chile.  It’s ok for the skin to burn a little; in fact it is what gives the chile its roasted flavor.
3. After the chilies are roasted place them in a plastic bag or tightly lidded bowel to steam.  You want to make sure the stems are not actually burning as this will melt the bag.  I have melted a few bags doing this.
4. After about 10 to 15 minutes peel the chilies by gently rubbing the skin off.  If you find burnt chile beneath the skin DON’T cut it out or otherwise discard it this is bonus flavor.
5. Once the chilies are skinned remove the stems or burnt nub of what used to be the stem.  The seeds can be discarded or kept; it is up to you.  The more seeds you have in your Chile Verde the more intimidating it looks.
6. Making the Chile.
7. In a large stock pot season the pork with pepper and brown.  With three pounds of cubed pork you should do this in batches so it actually has a chance of browning.
8. As the last of the pork is finishing add the diced onion and let it soften-up a bit then add the garlic and salt to taste.
9. Add the drained cans of tomatillos: they have enough liquid in them; they don’t need the excess from the can.  Mash the tomatillos up a bit so they break up as they stew.  You can do this by squishing them in half as you add them to the pot.  Be careful – they will pop and squirt all over the place.
10. Stir the mixture well making sure you get all that stuff off the bottom of the pot from the pork and onions.
11. Add the chilies in a similar manner to the tomatillos.  You want the chilies to end up in bite sized pieces but you still want them recognizable.
12. Chop up about half of the bunch of fresh cilantro and add it to the pot.
13. At this point you can transfer the chile to a crock pot (set to low) or just turn the stove down to low and keep an eye on it every once in a while and scrape the bottom of the pot as needed.  Allow the chile to cook for a couple of hours; you’ll know it is done when the meat is very tender and breaks apart easily when you taste it.  It seems it requires frequent taste testing. Add more chopped cilantro as need before serving.
14. Depending on the chilies you may need to add some habanero powder.  This stuff is powerful hot so add it sparingly; I use the tip of a coffee stir-stick to measure it out one scoop at a time with mandatory tasting between each scoop.  Heat it up as you see fit.
15. Serve with warm white corn tortillas.  Place a damp paper towel on a plate under a small stack of tortillas and top it off with another damp paper towel and a bowl to cover the stack.   Microwave on high for a couple of minutes or until they are heated through.
16. Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. Note for Canadians: I used the following to prepare this dish: 1 796-mL tin of tomatoes 1 398-mL tin of refried beans and 1 430-mL jar of picante sauce.
2. Also the cheese I used was a prepackaged shredded mix called"Casserole Mix"; it's a mixture of cheddar colby and monterey jack.
3. Feel free to spice this up as you please; I deliberately kept this lowkey and mild to please my husband who would not have liked it if I had added the"firepower" I would have liked to add; also note that the omission of salt is not an error--I didn't think the recipe needed salt at all.
4. Preheat oven to 325F; have ready an ungreased 13x9 pan.
5. Take 1 tortilla lightly spread a bit of margarine on both sides (going right to the edges) and place on a microwave-safe plate; I used a small piece of wax paper wadded up into a ball to do the spreading.
6. Place the next tortilla on top lightly spread margarine on it (on the top side only) get the next tortilla repeat process and so on and so on until you have a stack of 18 tortillas; this may take more than the 2 tbsp of margarine depending on how thinly you've spread it.
7. Place plate in microwave and cook on High for 5 minutes; when time is up set tortillas aside.
8. Meanwhile crumble beef into a large skillet and saute.
9. When brown place beef in a mixing bowl discarding any fat.
10. Stir chili powder into beef then add 1 cup shredded cheese and the tin of tomatoes; combine well.
11. Place 6 corn tortillas into the bottom of 13x9 pan; top with half the ground beef mixture.
12. Place 6 tortillas on top of beef.
13. Spread the refried beans across these 6 tortillas distributing as evenly as possible.
14. Top refried beans with remaining beef mixture.
15. Place the last 6 tortillas on top of beef mixture.
16. In a small bowl whisk together the entire jar of picante sauce with the sour cream.
17. Spread this mixture across the top of casserole making sure to cover all exposed areas of the corn tortillas.
18. Sprinkle remaining cheese over top of casserole.
19. Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes.
20. Serve with sour cream on the side if you wish and a green salad.,

instructions, 1. For the Quail:
2. Wash the ancho chilies and remove the stems and seeds. Soak the chilies in water for 5 minutes to soften them. In a blender puree the ancho chilies garlic orange juice and the juice of the lime with the oil. Marinate the quail in the puree for about an hour.
3. For the Black Bean Tortas.
4. (Refried Black Beans):
5. Place the black beans garlic and epazote in a pot with 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil and simmer until the beans are soft. If necessary add just enough additional water to keep the beans covered. When the beans are done allow them to cool in their own liquid. When the beans are cool puree half of them in their liquid until smooth. Combine the puree with the whole beans.
6. In a heavy skillet or pot combine the bacon and pork fat and cook over medium heat to render the fat. Add the cooked beans and stir the mixture over medium heat until the fat is absorbed and the mixture is thick. If the beans are too liquid continue to cook slowly over medium heat to evaporate the liquid until the mixture is thick.
7. In a clean skillet heat the butter until hot. Add the bean mixture and heat until hot. Add the beaten eggs and scramble with the beans. Add the salt and transfer to a plate and keep warm.
8. For the Guacamole:
9. Split and seed the avocados. Remove the meat to a mixing bowl. Add the sweet red pepper red onion Serrano chili cilantro and juice from the lime to the avocado. With the back of a large spoon mash the ingredients into a very coarse puree. Salt and pepper to taste.
10. To assemble the Tortas:
11. With a 2 inch cookie cutter or small knife punch out 12 small rounds from the tortillas. Spread some black beans (approximately 2 Tbsp) on one tortilla. Add a nugget (1/2 oz) of goat cheese to the black beans and top with the avocado mixture. Finish the tortas by covering the avocado mixture with a second small tortilla. In a large flat skillet heat a Tbsp of butter over moderate heat. Slowly fry the tortas on both sides until the tortillas are golden brown. Keep warm.
12. For the Sauce:
13. Grill the poblano chilies over a charcoal fire or under a broiler until the skins are charred. When cool peel and seed the chilies. Grill or broil the onion slices tomatillos and garlic cloves until lightly cooked. Heat the pumpkin seeds in a dry skillet until lightly toasted. In a blender combine the chilies tomatillos onion garlic maple syrup and one half of the pumpkin seeds with the chicken stock. Blend briefly (10 seconds) to give a coarse puree. Do not over blend. Transfer the puree to a sauce pot. If the puree is too thick add more stock; if too thin boil gently to reduce to a sauce-like consistency. Just before serving heat the sauce over moderate heat. Add the chopped cilantro and the remaining pumpkin seeds and whip in the butter. Salt and pepper to taste.
14. For the Tomato Salsa:
15. Roughly chop the tomatoes. Combine with the minced onion chopped cilantro and minced chili. Add the juice of the lime and mix thoroughly. Salt and pepper to taste.
16. To assemble the dish:
17. Grill the quail skin side down over a charcoal fire or skin side up in a broiler on a wire rack. The quail should be cooked almost entirely on the skin side. Grill the quail on the meat side for only a few seconds. This will prevent the meat from becoming too dry. The meat should be pink and not over-cooked. Depending on the temperature of the fire three to four minutes should be sufficient.
18. Place a warm black bean torta in the center of a dinner plate. Top each with some sour cream. Spoon some sauce onto each plate around the torta. Place a grilled quail on each side of the torta. Garnish with the tomato salsa and some sprigs of cilantro.,

2. Roast jalapeños in oven on greased baking sheet or cast iron for 20 minutes or until nicely charred but not burnt (keep an eye on them depending on your oven and depending on the size of your peppers).
3. When done transfer to metal or glass bowl and cover with plastic or a plate that will cover and let rest/steam for 10 minutes.
4. Once cool enough to handle peel what skin you can off of the peppers. Keep your hands away from your eyes and EVERYTHING else and immediately wash your hands with soap when you're finished or else this is going to be a bad day.
5. Depending on your heat tolerance (and of those you'll be serving) you can cut them in half and de-seed them or you can leave the seeds in - I leave them in but I like really spicy stuff. You could even take some out and leave some in whatever you like.
6. Mince the peppers and set aside.
7. In a medium bowl combine sour cream mayo and soup mix.
8. Add peppers Tony's and Cayenne pepper. Combine well.
9. Refrigerate for an hour or two - or overnight - so the flavors meld and the soup mix gets hydrated.

instructions, 1. NOTE: INSTANT MASA CORN FLOUR (TAMALE FLOUR) IS AVAILABLE IN MOST MAJOR SUPERMARKETS. IF SPICIER CHICKEN IS DESIRED USE PICKLED HOT PEPPER JUICE TO BRINE (OR) REDUCE PAPRIKA TO 1 TEASPOON AND INCREASE CHIPOTLE CHILE POWDER TO 1 TEASPOON (DO NOT ADD ANY MORE CHIPOTLE OR CAYENNE PEPPER THAN GIVEN HERE AS IT WILL IMPART A BITTER FLAVOR TO THE BREADING). FOR ADDED FLAVORS: YOU CAN BOIL BRINE FIRST WITH FRESH CILANTRO PEPPERS ONION AND GARLIC; COOL COMPLETELY; ADD FRESH LIME SLICES THEN CHICKEN. (STEP ONE): RINSE and blot chicken.
2. COMBINE 8 cups cold water and 2 tablespoons fine sea salt for the BRINE in a large wide saucepan (with an accompanying lid) until dissolved; ADD lime slices then chicken pieces; COVER and transfer to refrigerator; MARINATE chicken between 4-36 hours in refrigerator turning chicken as needed (marinate 36 hours for the most tender flavorful chicken). NOTE: FOR A QUICKER STOVETOP MARINATION METHOD PIERCE CHICKEN PIECES WELL WITH A FORK THEN HEAT THE BRINE WITH CHICKEN COVERED OVER LOW HEAT FOR 20-30 MINUTES (TURN CHICKEN ONCE MIDWAY THROUGH).
3. MEASURE the SEASONING ingredients into a large sealable container (such as a GLAD food storage container or a Ziploc bag); SEAL the container; SHAKE mixture well until thoroughly blended; OPEN container and add the BREADING ingredients; RESEAL container and shake well.
4. BEAT 4 large eggs in a medium bowl (for the eggwash); REMOVE chicken from the brine; RINSE chicken; BLOT chicken dry; DIP chicken in the EGGWASH (or batter) until evenly coated.
5. PLACE one piece battered chicken at a time into the breading mixture container; SEAL container firmly; SHAKE chicken gently in all motions to thoroughly coat chicken until evenly and generously breaded; PRESS breading firmly onto chicken; PLACE breaded chicken piece onto a rack to rest; REPEAT with remaining pieces chicken; ALLOW breaded chicken to absorb the breading for a few minutes before frying.
6. ADD the manufacturer's recommended amount oil for deep-frying (use canola oil); PLACE deep-fryer basket into place in deep-fryer; PREHEAT fryer to 315°F (or preheat enough fat to immerse chicken completely in deep heavy stovetop pot between 315°F to 325°F using a standard deep-fryer thermometer to gauge).
7. CAREFULLY drop each piece breaded chicken one at a time gently into the deep-fryer basket without crowding (if a standard size home fryer is used add no more than 2-3 pieces at a time); (if stovetop frying gently place breaded chicken pieces into hot oil using tongs turning once halfway through frying duration).
8. FRY chicken between 16-18 minutes until golden brown and fully cooked depending on chicken portions/sizes (juices should run clear when chicken is done); PLACE chicken on wire rack over baking sheet; TRANSFER into a preheated 170°F oven until all chicken has been fried.
9. MAINTAIN frying oil temperature for remaining chicken; REPEAT the same cooking/steaming or warming procedures for the remaining chicken; SERVE.

instructions, 1. Place the dried chipotles in a small cup with enough nearly boiling water to cover; allow to sit 30 minutes to soften.
2. Rinse shrimp under cold running water and drain thoroughly.
3. Heat 2 TBS olive oil in a large heavy skillet and add the shrimps (cautiously as they may spatter).
4. Toss the shrimps in the skillet until the shells turn pink just a minute or two.
5. Remove the shrimps with a slotted spoon to a bowl and leave aside until cool enough to handle (I put mine in the refrigerator for a few minutes).
6. Shell and devein shrimp reserving shells.
7. Add the shells back to the re-heated skillet along with half of the garlic and toss until the shells begin to brown a bit just a few minutes.
8. Add the wine and bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer 2-3 minutes.
9. While this is happening drain the chipotles (RESERVING WATER) and mince them as finely as possible (I don't remove the seeds but you may choose to do so).
10. Add enough water to the reserved chipotle water to equal 2 cups; add this to the skillet along with the remaining garlic chili powder bay leaf chili flakes and cumin seeds.
11. Reduce to a simmer and continue to cook until the liquid has reduced by half; strain and set the liquid aside.
12. Wipe the pan clean then melt the remaining 1 TBS olive oil and butter in it.
13. Gently saute the onion rings until they are soft and translucent and just beginning to brown around the edges.
14. Add the minced chipotles and continue to saute for another 2-3 minutes over moderate heat.
15. Add a cup of the reserved liquid and simmer until the mixture has reduced and thickened (though it won't really get too thick).
16. Add the cilantro if using and the shrimps and season to taste with pepper; cook over a moderate heat only just until the shrimps are heated through (overcooking will toughen them).
17. Serve over rice with lime wedges for squeezing on the side if desired.,

instructions, 1. In a medium saucepan set over medium heat combine the meat with 2 quarts salted water about 1/3 of the onions and half of the garlic and simmer until the meat is very tender about 1 1/2 hours.
2. Strain reserving the broth for another use.
3. When the meat is cool enough to handle shred it into coarse strands with your fingers or 2 forks don't worry that there are bits of onion and garlic mixed with the meat.
4. Wash and dry the saucepan set it over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of the oil.
5. When the oil is hot add half of the remaining onions and cook until golden about 6 minutes then stir in the remaining garlic and cook for another minute.
6. Add the tomatoes and chiles and cook until most of the juice has evaporated about 3 minutes.
7. Stir in the shredded meat and simmer for a few more minutes then taste and season with about 1/2 teaspoon salt.
8. Remove from the heat and set aside.
9. Heat a well-seasoned or nonstick griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat.
10. Knead the masa (fresh or reconstituted) to make it pliable adding a little water if necessary to achieve a soft-cookie-dough consistency.
11. Knead in the flour baking powder and 3/4 teaspoon salt.
12. Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll into balls; cover with plastic to keep from drying out.
13. Line a tortilla press with 2 pieces of plastic cut to fit the plates (to be on the safe side cut them from a food storage bag; the thicker plastic usually works better for beginners).
14. Gently press out a ball of dough between the sheets of plastic to about 4 inches in diameter (it'll be about 1/4 inch thick).
15. You've now made a gordita which is what you call a fat tortilla.
16. Peel off the top sheet of plastic flip the gordita uncovered side down onto the fingers of 1 hand and gently peel off the second piece of plastic.
17. In one flowing movement roll the gordita off your hand and onto the heated griddle or skillet.
18. Bake for about 1 1/2 minutes then flip and bake for another 1 1/2 minutes on the other side.
19. The gordita will be lightly browned and crusty on the top and bottom but still a little uncooked on the sides.
20. Remove to a plate.
21. Continue pressing and griddle-baking the remaining gorditas in the same manner.
22. When you're ready to serve warm the shredded beef.
23. Rinse the remaining onions in a small strainer under cold water and shake to remove the excess moisture.
24. Have the cheese and cilantro at the ready.
25. In a deep heavy medium skillet or saucepan heat 1/2-inch of oil over medium to medium-high until the oil is hot enough to make the edge of a gordita sizzle sharply about 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer.
26. One by one fry the gorditas turning them after they've been in the oil for about 15 seconds until they're nicely crisp but not hard about 45 seconds total.
27. When they're ready most will have puffed up a little like pita bread.
28. Drain on paper towels.
29. Once they all are fried use a small knife to cut a slit in the thin edge of each one about halfway around its circumference opening a pocket.
30. As you cut them fill each gordita with about 1/4-cup shredded meat and a sprinkling of the onions grated cheese sour cream and cilantro.,
