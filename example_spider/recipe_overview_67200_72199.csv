instructions, 1. DOUGH:
2. Put the flour in a bowl.
3. Slowly add about 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons water just enough to gather the dough together and make a ball.
4. Knead the dough well for 10 minutes.
5. Make a smooth ball and put it in a bowl.  Cover with a damp cloth and set aside for 30 minutes.  It will turn quite soft.
6. Divide into 12 balls.  Keep covered while you work with the twelfth.
7. COOK:
8. Set a cast-iron frying pan or griddle on medium-high heat.  Allow it to heat up.  Make a small wad with a cloth or paper towel and keep nearby.
9. Take a ball of dough and dust it well with flour.  Now roll it out into a 5-1/2-inch round on a floured surface.  Lift it up and slap it back and forth between your palms to shake off the extra flour.
10. DO THE FOLLOWING STEPS FAST:
11. Slap the chapati onto the hot griddle.  Let it cook for 45 seconds.
12. Turn it over and cook the second side for another 35-45 seconds.
13. Turn it over again and cook another 5 to 6 seconds pushing down on it with the paper wad and rotating it a little with each push.  Do this fast; it helps to puff up the chapati.
14. Put the cooked chapati on a plate and cover it with a towel or another upturned plate.
15. Make all the chapatis this way making sure to wipe off the cast-iron pan with a paper towel after each one is made.  If it takes you a while to roll out the next chapati turn the heat under the cast-iron pan down to low while you roll it and then turn it up again.  (Or have someone else form a chapati while you cook one.).
16. Serve immediately.
17. These can be made ahead and stored in a plastic bag in the refrigerator or freezer.  To reheat them wrap a whole bundle of them in foil and put them in a medium oven (350F/177C) for 15 minutes.  You can also sprinkle a little water on an individual chapati and then either heat it in a microwave oven for 30-45 seconds or slap it onto a hot lightly greased griddle for a few seconds on each side.,

instructions, 1. Method:.
2. Overnight Preparation:.
3. Mix the Ondhwa flour  plus the semolina and strong flour with  yoghurt to form a firm mixture. Cover it and keep it overnight in a warm place.  This enables the ondhwa flour to ferment.
4. On the next day:.
5. Grate the  potatoes onions and carrots.  Add them  to the Ondhwa mixture. ( You can also add a grated marrow or zuchini also if you wish - any vegetables that can cook well and provide moisture to the mixture can be added).   Blend the ginger garlic and green chillies in a mixer or blender and add to the mixture . Add the salt and turmeric. Mix it all together in a fairly large saucepan or basin.
6. Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a saucepan.  Add the mustard seeds cloves and cinnamon to the oil. Add a tablespoon of sesame seeds to the oil.  Once the mustard seeds stop popping pour the hot oil over the ondhwa mixture and stir well.
7. Mix the sodabicarbonate with a half cup of warm water and add this to the mixture.  The mixture will start to rise (Hence the need for using a large saucepan or basin).
8. Transfer the mixture into a very well greased  baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining sesame seeds on top of the mixture and bake at 170 degrees for 30 minutes and 150 degrees for 10 minutes.   Check that it's cooked by putting a knife in the middle of the ondhwa.  If the knife comes out dry - the ondhwa is cooked.  If not - give it an extra 5-10 minutes. The top of the Ondhwa should look fairly dark when it is cooked.Ondhwo will be crispy on the outside but lovely and firm on the inside.
9. This can be served with yoghurt and coconut chutney or with coriander and chilly chutney.,

7. NOTE: The ideal incubation temperature is 115 degrees F plus or minus 10. Instead of a warm oven you can use a sunny outdoor spot during summertime. In winter you can set the container by a radiator or wood stove. Recently I have found the crockpot is a reliable heat source. Simply place water in your crockpot filling the pot about halfway. Then place the covered yogurt container inside the crockpot making sure the water does not enter the yogurt. You can then use a thermometer to monitor the water temperature and adjust your crockpot during the incubation period to maintain ideal temperature.,

instructions, 1. Wash toor daal in 4 changes of water then set to cook. put enough water in the toor daal to be about 1 1/2 inches above the daal. If you don't have a pressure cooker it should take somewhere around 45 minutes for the daal to become soft.

Add a pinch of cooking soda salt and the finely chopped Ginger and onion for enhancing the taste of the round fritters which will be made eventually. Keep aside.
2. Whisk curd in a bowl with little water. Get watery consistency.  Keep aside. Take another empty bowl and mix the gram flour with little quantity of water so that a thick paste is formed. Keep stirring to ensure no lumps are formed. Mix the curd and gram flour paste slowly. Keep aside.
3. In a Mixer make a paste of Green chili Ginger and Garlic. Mix this in the curd infused with gram flour paste. Stir well.
4. Heat a Pan/Bowl and pour this mixture and let it cook till the first boil. Add the above remaining dry ingredients ( Fenugreek seeds Cinnamon Cloves and curry leaves) while its cooking. After it gets the first boil simmer on low flame for a few minutes.
5. In a Tadka pan heat 2Tbsp oil and add cumin seeds and turmeric powder along with the Kashmiri red chilis. Once the cumin seeds change color add the hot Tadka to the other bowl with the simmering Kadhi/curry in it.
6. Take a deep wok and add oil in it. Take the Black gram flour mixture and make balls as per your need and deep fry them till they become golden brown on the outer side. Don’t keep the flame on high as they may get too dark. We need a soothing golden brown color which won’t strike the eye as we serve.
7. Remove from the Wok and straight away add to the simmering curry/Kadhi. Switch off the gas in less than a minute. Rest it for a few minutes before serving.  Garnish with fresh coriander (optional) and serve hot. It goes well with Plain Rice/ Basmati Rice or Khichadi. This is called Kadhi Wada in India and could be called Fritter Curry outside India. .

instructions, 1. Sift the two flours into a large bowl and add the salt. Slowly pour in the water and mix into the flour to make a fairly soft dough; add more water if necessary. Knead to make the dough pliable.
2. Wet your hands and knead the dough again; this binds the flours together thoroughly and makes the dough extra smooth. Wrap in foil and put in a cool place for 30 minutes.
3. Divide the dough into twelve to fourteen balls and roll each one on a floured surface to a circle about 5 inches in diameter.
4. Heat a heavy based frying pan or griddle on a medium heat. Cook the bread circles one at a time on the hot griddle or frying pan for 1 minute. When small bubbles start appearing on the surface of the bread flip the circle over. Cook the second side for about 30 seconds until the bread slides off the pan easily.
5. If cooking on gas hold the chappati over the gas flame; the side which was cooked first should be over the flame; this will make it puff up. If cooking on an electric or soild burner simply press the side that was cooked first hard with a folded kitchen towel; this will puff it up slightly. Place the cooked circles in a folded napkin and put onto a plate or into a bread basket to keep warm while you cook the remainder.
6. Serve with hot melted ghee or butter brushed over one side of the chappati.,

instructions, 1. Note: I always make bread dough with my standing mixer using a dough hook. Although artisan bread can easily be made by mixing it in a bowl with a large spoon.
2. In the mixer's bowl whisk together the water milk yeast salt yogurt and honey. Add the flours about 1/3 at a time while mixing on low to medium speed. When all of the flour has been added and combined turn the mixer to medium and let it knead the dough for a minute or two.
3. Transfer to a larger bowl that has been coated lightly with olive oil to prevent sticking. Cover the container loosely with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel leaving some way for air to escape. Allow it to rest at room temperature for about 2 hours or until the dough rises and collapses.
4. The dough can be used immediately after its initial rise though it's much easier to handle when cold. Refrigerate until ready to use. It will last for 7 days when refrigerated.
5. At this point it can also be frozen. I'll typically freeze the dough in 1/4 pound portions and thaw in the refrigerator overnight before the day I'd like to use it.
6. Note: This batch of dough makes enough for sixteen 1/4 pound portions.  Each 1/4 pound portion will make 2 pieces of naan 1 pizza crust or 1 flatbread.
7. On baking day  --  punch down a 1/4 pound portion of dough and divide into two equal balls. Using a rolling-pin roll each piece of dough into an oval shape. The dough should be about 6-8 inches long and about 1/4-inch thick but no thinner. Repeat this method with the rest of the dough or as much as you'd like to make.
8. Warm a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat (you want a hot pan). Brush both sides of the naan with olive oil or clarified butter.  Place the Naan on the hot skillet cover and bake for 1 minute until you see bubbles starting to form. Flip and cook for 1-2 minutes on the other side until large toasted spots appear on the underside. Place the naan in a tea towel-lined dish.
9. Repeat with the rest of the naan.

instructions, 1. Heat a wok or kadai spray with butter flavored cooking spray and add semolina. You can also use 1 tsp ghee instead of cooking spray for a more fragrant (albeit higher fat) version.
2. Roast stirring occasionally until fragrant (about 7-8 minutes).
3. Take out semolina and keep aside.
4. After wiping off the hot pan to remove leftover semolina grains add the oil.
5. When oil is hot add the tempering ingredients - mustard seeds cumin seeds. If you wish you may also add spilt urad dal.
6. When mustard seeds sputter stir in chopped onions ginger curry leaves and green chilies. Note that you can deseed the chilies if you don't want any heat.
7. In the meantime bring the 2 cups of water to boil and add salt to it.
8. Back to your wok stir regularly and when the onions are transparent add diced tomatoes and let cook for a couple of minutes.
9. When tomatoes are cooked add the roasted semolina you kept aside earlier and mix well.
10. Pour boiling salted water over this mixture give a quick stir and cover with lid.
11. Let it cook for 3 minutes on low flame. Then take off lid and add chopped cilantro cashews and 1 Tbsp grated coconut. Mix well.
12. Take off heat and serve hot garnished with the remaining tablespoon of grated coconut and a sprig of fresh cilantro.
13. NOTE 1: Don't over-roast the semolina or it won't cook well.
14. NOTE 2: Possible additions - grated carrots fresh green peas roasted peanuts. You could also add 2 tablespoons cashews (roasted pieces) and/or 2 tablespoons coconut (grated fresh) along with the cilantro.
15. NOTE 3: If you try to add salt after you take the upma off heat it won't incorporate very well. So I suggest tasting the upma just before you add cilantro etc. and add more salt if you wish. Make a note of how much salt your family prefers and next time add the entire amount to the water.,

( I sometimes have trouble with getting my mustard seeds to pop. I always suspect that it has to do with their age but I'm only guessing there. If they don't pop in  a reasonable amount of time I just proceed. It's never affected the flavor of the finished dish).
2. Add the onion garlic and green chile if you're using one. Stir fry these for 5 minutes adjusting the heat down partway through the fry time.
3. Add the potatoes and increase the heat a little. Stir fry for 5 minutes then cover turn the heat back down a bit and cook  for 4 minutes. I lift the lid and give them a quick stir halfway through this time. The potatoes and onion will be starting to brown at this point.

instructions, 1. Mix marinade ingredients and set aside.
2. Set aside a small portion of the chopped scallions for garnish and add remainder to the marinade.
3. Set meat onto a cutting board- it is usually an almost rectangular shape with two shorter sides and two longer sides- position the meat so the"longer" sides are on the top and bottom and the"short" sides are left and right.
4. Take note of the sinewy lines running straight along the"long" side of the meat- those are the grain lines.
5. Take a large chef's knife and cut a very very thin slice of meat off of the short end as you do so you should be cutting through the grain lines (top to bottom) as if you were making a line through a grid or a tic-tac toe board- this should result in thin short strips of meat (cutting through the sinewy lines this way will produce tender meat). Cut all of the meat into these thin short strips and add them all to the marinade.
6. Take a vegetable peeler and peel carrots (discard peels)- then using the veggie peeler continue to"peel" off strips of the carrot meat until the carrots are all cut into long wide thin strips- add to marinade and seal container and flip over a few times to make sure everything is coated.
7. Let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
8. Drain meat& carrot stripsreserving the marinade into a small saucepan (don't worry is some of the green onions end up in the meat or the marinade- they will all get cooked eventually).
9. Heat 1 tsp sesame oil in a large wok or large deep skillet over medium-high heat.
10. Stir fry half of the meat strips until just cooked through (maybe 5 minutes or so)- there may still be a little pink remaining- immediately remove to a covered dish to keep warm then stir fry remaining beef (about another 5 minutes or so) and remove it to the same covered dish.
11. (Don't try to cook this all together or you will steam the meat and it will get too watery).
12. Add the marinade to the empty pan and bring to a boilonce it boils let boil rapidly for 3 minutes to reduce sauce and kill off any bacteria.
13. While it is reducing portion out 1 cup cooked rice per serving (see TIP below) and divide meat& carrots among each plate.
14. Drizzle reduced marinade over rice and meat and garnish with reserved raw green onion slices and a sprinkling of sesame seeds.
15. TIP: I use a small custard cup or even a 1 cup measuring scoop to form the rice into decorative portions-if you press the freshly cooked Jasmine rice (which is slightly sticky) into the bowl to fill it tightly then flip it over onto the plate when you remove the bowl the rice will have taken the shape of the cup.,

2. Note: here's a trick I learned from Rachael Ray about fresh ginger. I love using fresh ginger in recipes but I never seem to have it on hand since it goes rotten in the refrigerator before I can use it. So the next time you're at the store grab a large piece of ginger. Peel the entire thing and cut it into 1/2 inch pieces. Put it into a storage bag and keep it in the refrigerator. When you need a few teaspoons or so all you have to do it pull out one of the small pieces and grate the alloted amount with your Microplane or a zester. It grates really well frozen! Ta da!,

Grill about 2 minutes then turn 45 degrees to get grill marks.  Grill another 2 min before flipping then repeat on the other side.  This should take about 8 minutes and the thighs should be bare char marks and perfectly cooked through on the inside.  About 3 minutes before the thighs are finshed place the prepared green onions on the grill.  Allow the thighs to rest for about 10 minutes then slice against the grain.
3. To build a wrap open a lettuce leaf.  Place in a bit of chicken fresh cilantro grilled green onions and top it off with a generous amount of Sriracha.,

instructions, 1. Put the black sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over medium heat. The moment they begin to pop and release their aroma remove them from the pan and let cool. Blitz the seeds in a coffee grinder or food processor until finely ground then place them in a bowl and com bine them with the agave syrup to form a paste.
2. Heat 1 can of the coconut milk the sugar and the salt in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat until the sugar has dissolved.
3. In a bowl slowly whisk the remaining can of coconut milk into the cornstarch ensuring there are no lumps. Add this to the saucepan mix everything together and cook for 4–6 minutes over medium-high heat stirring constantly until the mixture becomes thick. Use a spatula to stir the mixture making sure the bottom does not burn or become lumpy. When thickened remove the pan from the heat and transfer the mixture to a large bowl. If there are any lumps pass the mixture through a sieve into a bowl.
4. Stir the sesame seed paste into the ice cream mixture until combined. Place parchment paper onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming and leave to cool completely. Refrigerate for 1–2 hours until well chilled. (You can speed this process up by placing the bowl into an ice bath.).
5. Churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Alternatively pour the mixture into a wide flat (preferably metal) pan and place in the freezer. After 40 minutes use a fork to mix and break down the ice crystals. Repeat this process twice more at 40-minute intervals. You can blitz it all in a food processor at the final stage to make it really smooth. Return it to the pan and leave in the freezer to set fully. Remove 15 minutes before serving to give the ice cream a chance to soften.

instructions, 1. Place eggplant pieces in a large bowl and dust turmeric on top. With your hands massage turmeric into eggplant until it even coats the fleshy side of each piece. Set aside.
2. Place tamarind pulp in a small bowl and mix with warm water. Let pulp soften 10-15 minutes. Squeeze and massage softened pulp through your fingers loosening fruit's pulp from sinew and seeds. With your fingers remove all sold pieces and discard. You will have a caramel-colored extract.
3. Pour oil to a depth of 1 inch into a 3-quart sauce pan (I used a wok) and place over medium to medium-high heat until hot but not smoking - about 365 degrees. You can test it by spearing a piece of eggplant onto a fork dipping edge into hot oil. If it begins to fry and a froth of oil immediately bubbles around it oil is ready.
4. Fry eggplant in batches of no more than 3 pieces at a time (KOD note: In a wider wok you could probably get away with 10 pieces) until fleshy side of each piece just begins to turn golden about 90 seconds. Eggplant should be just cooked and not at all soft or mushy. Using a slotted spoon transfer eggplant to paper towels to drain.
5. Turn off heat. Let oil cool for a few minutes then pour off all but about 2 tablespoons (KOD note: Very important step; otherwise you will have a very oily curry.).
6. Reheat pan this time over medium-low heat. Add garlic and shallots and cook until they turn limp and translucent about 2 minutes. Do not let them turn brown.
7. Add chiles and all ground spices. Saute stirring gently to prevent from scorching about 3 minutes.
8. Add coconut milk and water stir to combine and increase heat to medium. Bring coconut milk to a lively simmer and reduce heat so that mixture stays at a gentle simmer. Stir in tamarind sugar and salt; continue to simmer about 15 minutes.
9. Add eggplant and cook until it is fork-tender about 1-2 minutes. Do not let it overcook and fall apart. Taste for salt and add as necessary.
10. Transfer to a bowl and serve slightly warm or at room temperature.,

2. Popiah skins are very thin crepelike sping roll wrappers.  IF you cannot find them use mu-shu pancakes instead.  These are soft wheat flour wrappers traditionally used for Chinese dishes.  There is also a recipe on zaar.  NOTE it is NOT a Vegan wrapper. If you are making it Vegan search for another wrapper.  The spring roll wrapper might work that is on zaar.  However I won't promise it will.

instructions, 1. First prepare the filling. Put the onion in a medium frying pan and without adding the oil “sweat” it over medium heat stirring often just until slightly softened. Add the oil and when it is heated up add the tomato paste and pepper paste.  Stir to mix.  Toss in the rice and sugar and cook over low heat stirring frequently to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan for 10-15 minutes. To check for doneness of the filling - take a bite on a rice grain: if it is soft on the outside and only slightly grainy inside the filling is ready. Take care not to overcook. The rice will cook further inside the peppers. Remove the filling from the heat. Add the mint. Season with salt. Stir to mix and allow to cool.
2. Meanwhile wash the peppers and pat dry. Cut a circle around the pepper stalk leaving the circle attached. It will serve as a lid later. With your fingers push the core of the peppers to the sides (because their core is tiny and the seeds are minimal there is no need to remove them). Rub the inside of the shells with some salt.
3. Fill the peppers with the rice filling half full (do not overfill - the rice will expand while cooking). Put the pepper “lids” on. If you like you could place a small grape tomato under each lid. Arrange the peppers in a saute pan (large enough to fit all the peppers) in a slightly overlapping manner. Pour in the water.
4. Cover and cook over medium heat until liquid is reduced to oil and the rice is fully cooked about 1 hour. Note that the cooked peppers should not be mushy and should hold their shape nicely. Remove from the heat. If you wish drizzle some olive oil on top of the peppers. Cover and allow to cool completely (yes covered). Serve cold. This dolma stores well in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.,

instructions, 1. Place the milk and cream into a pot and bring to almost a boil. Making sure you don't burn the milk on the bottom of the pot (A non-stick pot if possible).
2. Turn off heat and let cool to 115 degrees.
3. As the milk is heating up and then cooling add 3-4 tablespoons of cultured yogurt in a cup.
4. Let sit at room temperature (about 70 degrees).
5. When the milk has cooled to the correct temperature add some to the cup with the yogurt.
6. Next stir well and then add back into the pot of milk stir.
7. Next take a clean glass jar/ovenproof bowl and pour the milk into it stir well.
8. Cover the jar/bowl with plastic wrap and then a dish cloth.
9. Take a clip-on desk lamp (shade and with a 75 watt bulb) and point it toward the surface of the jar/bowl (about 6 inches away).
10. Let the jar/bowl with the milk and yogurt starter incubate under the heat lamp for about 8 to 12 hours.  I prefer 12 hours with the finished yogurt having a nice tangy taste and consistency!
11. Refrigerate!
12. NOTE: The longer you let the yogurt stay under the heat lamp the more tangy the yogurt will taste.
13. The amount of yogurt starter used is another factor in the success of the finished yogurt; too much or too little is no good.
14. Also the environment in which you place the jar/bowl can effect the finished yogurt as well.
15. For example if you are placing the jar/bowl of milk in a 80-85 degree kitchen area you can reduce the time it sits under the lamp. Or in some cases no lamp is needed.
16. Further you can use a conventional oven which has been heated to 200 degrees and then turned off. Then place the jar/bowl with the milk & yogurt starter inside the oven for about 2 to 4 plus hour.
17. (I have also used my microwave convection oven but not the microwave feature).,

Once all the okra is well browned remove to a paper towel-lined platter with a slotted spoon and set aside until ready to serve.
3. In a serving bowl whisk yogurt with the salt and sugar. Place cayenne and turmeric in a small pile on yogurt but do not mix in yet. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet over high heat. When oil begins to smoke add mustard seeds covering pan with a lid. When mustard seeds stop sputtering pour hot oil directly over cayenne and turmeric. This ensures the spices have a cooked flavor without getting burnt.

instructions, 1. Dice the onions and sauté with 1/4 cup of olive oil.
2. When they turn translucent add the pine nuts and sauté for 5 more minutes.
3. Add rice and stir constantly for 5-10 minutes until the rice is translucent.
4. Add the spices (dried mint cinnamon lemon salt black pepper dried currants sugar and allspice) and chopped parsley.
5. After another quick stir add 1/2 cup of boiling water and simmer on low medium heat for 15-20 minutes until all the liquid is absorbed by the rice mixture.
6. Take off heat and let cool.
7. And now here comes the fun part. Traditionally you would put a spoonful of the cooled mixture in the center of the top part of the leaf fold the sides inwards and then roll the leaf like a cylinder. But since I have “The Ultimate Dolma Machine” (follow the link mentioned in the description section) I just placed a leaf on the rubber compartment of the machine put a tbps of mixture in the middle and with a single slide there comes my dolma from the other side of the machine. The process was a breeze. It took me only 10 minutes to roll nearly 40 perfectly shaped dolmas. Below is the process fully photographed.
8. As the final step spread a layer of vine leaves on the bottom of a large and heavy pot (to prevent the stuffed leaves from burning).
9. Lay all your dolmas side by side and tuck very tightly.
10. Transfer the remaining 1/4 cups of olive oil juice of half a lemon and 2 cups of boiling water cover with a plate upside down (so that the dolmas don’t move around in boiling water) and bring to a boil.
11. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until all the water is absorbed (roughly 45-60 minutes).
12. Transfer to your serving dish and let cool.,

instructions, 1. To make dough: Melt butter. Add milk sugar and salt. Check the temperature (it should be 35-37 C) and crumble yeast into the mixture. Add eggs and egg whites stir. Gradually add flour; knead the dough for about five minutes or until it is smooth and elastic and starts to pull away from the edges of the bowl. Cover and let rise for 30-60 minutes.
2. To make cheese filling: Finely chop onion and garlic. Heat oil in a pan and cook onion and garlic until softened. Let cool. Crumble feta in a bowl with a fork and mix all ingredients together into a paste.
3. To make ground beef filling: Finely chop onion and garlic. Heat oil in a pan and cook onion garlic and ground beef until browned. Add all remaining ingredients except for egg. Check the taste: the filling should taste fairly strong and salty. Let cool and finally mix in egg.
4. Preheat oven to 225°C Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Oil the baking board and turn the dough on it. Divide the dough in half and cut each half into 8 pieces.
5. Roll each piece out into an oval about ½ cm thick. Divide the fillings between the 16 ovals. Turn a few centimetres of the dough on top of the filling on each side and pinch the ends together tightly so you have a boat-shaped pasty. (You can bring the sides quite close together as the pasties "open" a bit as they bake). Carefully transfer the pasties on the baking sheet. Brush the sides with egg yolk and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.
6. Serve warm or at room temperature.,

instructions, 1. Heat the oil in a saucepan.  Chop the onion finely and add it along with the garlic.  When the onions are translucent add the turmeric (it will look like a lot but have no fear!).  Add the chicken and stir around until well blended.  Add the water or chicken stock.
2. Bring to a boil and add the rice.  Lower heat cover and simmer for about 20 minutes stirring very gently once or twice.
3. Remove cover add the chopped vegetables cook for about 5 minutes longer.  Dissolve the cornstarch in some cold water (to prevent clumps) and slowly add it to the soup mixing well.  Add the lemon. Heat for another 5-10 minutes on medium heat-- if it is too thin you can add some more cornstarch.
4. Now for the fun part!  Remove the saucepan from heat.  In a bowl beat the eggs together very well.  SLOWLY pour the eggs into the soup whisking very quickly with a fork (if you are too slow stirring or dump the eggs in too fast you will end up with something akin to egg-drop soup!).  After all the eggs are in the soup continue whisking for a few minutes.  If you get it right the first time the soup should be very yellow and have a velvety texture.
5. Season with salt/pepper taste and adjust the lemon juice or water amounts if needed.  Garnish with mint dill or lemon wedges (if desired) and serve!,

instructions, 1. Line a 9 x 13 pan with parchment paper for easy extraction and to prevent the bottom from becoming soggy.
2. Thaw out your puff pastry according to the package's directions or use your own homemade variety. When I plan to bake up this beast I usually have just come back from the grocery store with all the stuff needed and let it sit out on the counter straight from the shopping bag. By the time I'm done preparing everything else it's done thawing.
3. Put the spinach and herbs (plus the salt and pepper) into a food processor and do a few rough chops. I use these big 14-oz cartons of spinach from my local store; 12-oz bags work just fine too. Or two thawed 10-oz packets if you don't feel like buying fresh.
4. Pulse the mixture until it reaches its desired consistency. I like mine a little chunky. Extract and place into a mixing bowl. You can put the onion in now or also pulse it with the spinach-herb mixture in the food processor depending on what consistency you'd like. I like to do a rough hand chop then add later.
5. If using a block of feta cheese run it through your food processor or blender a few times to get it nice and crumbled. Mashing it up with a fork works too. Drain any excess liquid.
6. Mix the feta and olive oil with the spinach-onion mixture in the mixing bowl.
7. In a separate bowl rinse and drain the navy beans well and pat them dry with a paper towel. Coat in the lemon juice add a little salt and pepper and shake them around a little. Mix into the big mixing bowl of the spinach-cheese mixture.
8. Once blended in spread the mixture over the puff pastry sheet.
9. Lay the other pastry sheet on top of the filling. Brush it with olive oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
10. Bake for 30-35 minutes at 400F or until nice and golden on top. Let cool for at least 10 minutes prior to eating though the yummy aromas of spinach cheese and herbs will tempt you to burn your tongue on it right now!,

2. Put everything in a big pot and cook until the veggies are tender. Put 2/3rds of the soup in the blender and blend until smooth. Pour back into the pot. Add the refried beans as the last step. Why last? They tend to settle on the bottom and can burn. Stir and smash the congealed beans until they are no longer one huge clump o'beans.
3. Variations I have tried include adding salsa spooning it over rice or mashed potatoes topping it with sour cream and green onions or just adding some chopped onions on top. Definitely a crowd pleaser!,

instructions, 1. Combine the soy sauce sake and mirin.  This is the marinade.  To use marinate whatever you're cooking for about half an hour in a small amount of marinade (1-2 tablespoons for a boneless chicken breast fish filet small beef steak or block of tofu) then grill.
2. If you want to make the sauce mix the soy sauce sake mirin sugar ginger and garlic then heat over low heat for about 20 minutes.  Do NOT re-use marinade to make the sauce -- use ingredients that have not touched any meat.  Use less sugar if you prefer -- I don't advise using more.  Remove the ginger and garlic.  Use the sauce to glaze whatever you're grilling for the final minute.  Remove the grilled food slice into bite-sized pieces and serve over rice with a spoonful or so of warm teriyaki sauce to top.
3. This recipe makes enough for 4 when made as a marinade enough for 2 when made as a sauce.,

2. Dampen a cloth or paper towel wring it out and use it to gently pat the surface of the piece of kelp- do not wipe it hard just remove surface dust; some of the white powder clinging to it is clean pleasant flavor from the ocean.
3. Put the kelp into the pot.
4. Heat the water and when you can tell it is about to boil but before it does remove the kelp.
5. Add the bonito flakes and let the water come to a full boil.
6. As soon as the water starts to boil turn off the heat.
7. Let the bonito flakes start to settle to the bottom of the saucepan.
8. You can strain the soup as soon as the flakes start to settle- 30 seconds to 1 minute or for a stronger flavor (which you may or may not want depending on what you are making) you can leave them in a few minutes longer- some of the recipes I have seem to imply that the flakes will all settle within a few minutes but perhaps that depends on the kind you have; mine never all settle and I find that a soak longer than a few minutes does not improve the flavor much anyway.
9. To strain: line a strainer with a piece of cheesecloth (optional but neater) and filter the dashi through it.
10. You now have ichiban dashi.
11. This dashi will keep for a few days in a glass container in the refrigerator.
12. You can also make secondary dashi (niban dashi) by re-using the kelp and bonito flakes once; I haven't practiced that yet.,

instructions, 1. Drain the bean curd and wrap it tightly in a clean kitchen towel. Place it on a flat surface that will hold water and place a light weight on top. Let it drain for at least 3-4 hours and up to 12 hours. Remove the pressed curd to a dry towel and gather up the edges of the towel to form a bag and gently squeeze it mashing the curd as you do so.
2. Empty the mashed tofu into a bowl and add the chopped vegetables and sesame seeds. Hand mix well and knead for a few minutes. Sprinkle a pinch of salt over the mixture and mix it in then add the egg white or glutinous yam to bind it all together. Continue to knead for another minute or so then lightly oil your hands and form into 12 patties.
3. Heat the oil to 300-325 degrees and deep fry the patties in batches for 2-3 minutes or until they float on the surface well puffed. Flip them over and continue to fry another few minutes until golden. Drain patties well on a rack or paper towels. Combine the simmering stock ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil stirring until the sugar is melted. Add the fried patties and lower the heat to maintain a steady simmer. For best results simmer with a Japanese dropped lid or turn the patties several times so that all surfaces have a chance to absorb the seasoned stock. Cook for 5-6 minutes or until the stock has been reduced by half. Serve warm or at room temperature with a bit of stock ladled over the patties.
4. Note: Handling glutinous yam may irritate your skin so wear gloves when peeling and grating and use a spoon for mixing.,

instructions, 1. Cook the rice:
2. In a saucepan place 3 cups cold water with 2 cups sushi rice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not lift the lid during cooking.
3. Prepare seasonings and fillings while rice is cooking.
4. Aim to have all the ingredients prepared and placed on separate plates and bowls ready to roll when the rice has been cooked and cooled.
5. In a small bowl mix together the 4 tablespoons rice vinegar 3 tablespoons sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. This will be used to season the rice.
6. In a slightly larger bowl (large enough to dip your hands in) mix 1 cup of water with 2 tablespoons rice vinegar. This will be used to keep your hands and equipment moistened and thus keeping the rice from sticking to everything while you are making the rolls.
7. Sprinkle a large tray or platter with this water and rice vinegar solution. This will be used for cooling the rice.
8. Peel and slice the avocado. Squeeze the juice from the lemon over the slices to prevent them from browning.
9. Slice the carrots and cucumber into matchsticks. Slice the mushrooms.
10. Season and cool the rice:
11. When the rice has cooked add the sugar vinegar and salt mixture to the saucepan with the rice and gently stir through. You can buy special rice paddles for this purpose but a spoon or fork will suffice - just be careful not to break up the grains.
12. Place the rice onto the moistened tray or platter. Spread it out. Take a magazine piece of cardboard or similar and fan the rice with it (as you would you face on a hot day). Turn the rice occasionally and continue fanning until the rice has cooled to around room temperature.
13. Make your rolls:
14. Position your bamboo rolling mat so as to roll away from you. Place one sheet of nori on your mat shiney side down.
15. Dip your hands in the water and vinegar solution. Take a ball of rice (about 1 cup) and place on the nori. Spread the rice by patting it over the 3/4 of the nori closest to your body. The rice should be around 6 mm (1/4") thick. Neaten the two edges of the rice that will be seen when the roll is finished. The 1/4 of the nori without the rice will be the section that seals the roll.
16. Along the centre of the rice place your fillings.
17. Now start rolling. Lift the edge of the mat closest to you. I use the mat to just start the roll but you can use the mat for the whole of the rolling process. Once the roll is started I pull back the mat and finish rolling (reasonably firmly) by hand keeping the fillings tucked in as I go. Then I wrap the mat around the roll and with firm even pressure I run my hands along the mat thus creating an even and well sealed roll. If the roll doesn't seal completely I use a finger dampened in the water and rice solution to help it.
18. Using a very sharp knife damped in the water and vinegar solution cut the rolls into the size desired - in half for longer rolls like those sold at many take away shops or into 6 or 8 pieces for the smaller servings as shown in the photograph.
19. I like to refrigerate my rolls for a little while as I like them cold and I find the nori tends to become less chewy. You can however eat them straight way. Serve with a little GF soy sauce or tamari and enjoy.
20. Makes ten 10 cm (4") long rolls thirty 3 cm (1 1/3") long rolls or forty 2.5 cm (1") rolls.,

instructions, 1. I just use any leftover white rice I have and warm it in the microwave with a little water.
2. In a small bowl mix about 2-3 Table of mayo and 1-Tab of soy sauce and splash of rice vinegar about 1/2 Tab I think. Mix that with your rice till all rice coated. It may make your rice look a little brown because of the soy sauce but it should not look like rice pudding. That's too much mayo unless you want it that way. Here you can taste the rice a see if you like it or not and if you want more mayo or soy sauce or vinegar.
3. For your smoked salmon cut it into strips or smaller if like. In another small bowl mix a splash of soy sauce and 1/2 Tab mayo and tiny bit of wasabi paste. Pre warning to people new to sushi. Wasabi paste will clear your nose so DON'T use too much. Taste and adjust. Then add smoked salmon and mix just till lightly coated. Like the rice you are just coating it.
4. Then spread rice on seaweed sheet.
5. Lightly sprinkle rice with sesame seeds and put your strips of cucumber salmon and ginger on one end. I also like to put a line of wasbi paste in front of that- then roll.
6. And there you have it. It maybe a little messy if you put too much filling; but if so just eat it and remember to add less next time.,

6. Add the 1/2 cup of tenkasu to the okonomiyaki batter.
7. Make a large pancake (or two smaller ones) in the skillet with the okonomiyaki batter - you will have to be turning this pancake over at some point so don't make it so big that you won't be able to flip it.
8. Place the cooked pork belly on top of the pancake and push it down a bit (gently) into the batter. Let the pancake cook for about 10 minutes. Keep peeking at the bottom - you want it to brown but not to burn.
9. Flip the pancake over and let it cook for another 5 minutes or so until it is browned.
10. Place the pancake on a plate and top with okonomi sauce mayonnaise and bonito flakes - the heat from the pancake will make the bonito flakes "dance"! It's pretty cool.,

instructions, 1. Turn broiler on high with rack 2-3 inches from heat source. ( If its summer time use a grill instead the dish is much better).
2. In a medium Sauce pan bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Once boiling stir in 1 cup of rice reduce heat to low and cover. Once most of the water has been absorbed into the rice fluff the rice with a fork and set aside.
3. In a large skillet add 1 Tbsp of olive oil on medium heat. Add the yellow onion to the pan and saute until the onion starts to sweat; add the shitake mushrooms. When the onions are translucent and the mushrooms skin is a slightly dark brown they are done. When the vegetables are ready add the rice to the skillet and mix them together; set aside.
4. In a medium skillet add 1 Tbsp of olive oil on medium heat crack 2 eggs directly into the pan while trying to keep them separate from each other. Cook the eggs for ~3 minutes each side or until the albumin(clear part of the egg) is all white.
5. While everything else is cooking place your steak in a broiler safe pan season with salt and pepper and place it in the oven. Cook the steak for ~4 minutes each side this should cook the steak to medium (NOTE: broilers are different in every oven and can vary cook time drastically so cook the steak in accordance with how hot your broiler usually runs.) Once the steak is done let it rest covered in tin foil on the counter for ~5 minutes to let the juices redistribute throughout. thinly Slice the steak on a bias against the grain.
6. Once everything is complete spoon rice onto your plate followed by the steak on top and an egg on top of that. What makes this dish for me is the ketchup so squirt it all over. ENJOY ^_^!,

instructions, 1. The Omelette stage: ?Put oil into your fry pan and heat it for a while then start putting your rice into the fry pan and fry it for a while. After the rice is starting to get crispy put some ketchup in and keep frying it until the color is lighter than red(taste it). You can keep adding ketchup if you want more taste.      Now after the fried rice  put it into a bowl and start making scrambled egg that isn't scrambled. Crack your eggs into a bowl and mix it until it looks good you can add those special sugar liquid into your egg so that your egg tastes good for your child now put oil into your fry pan and pour in the egg(liquid) slowly so the oil doesn't come out. When the egg is ready to scramble DO NOT scramble it and put it on another plate.
2. The Tempura stage:.?Cut some pieces of hammushroom and carrot into pieces. now pour your Tempura flour into a bowl and add a small amount of water and mix it. If you need more water then keep adding but do not add to much. Start heating your pot now and put some oil on the bottom and sides of your pot. When the pot is ready use chopsticks to pick up the shrimps first and put it into the Tempura flour liquid and put it into the pot that has water in it(you need to add a little water in it but not too little) . After 1 thing is done take it out immediately and taste your shrimp to know how long yo should put it into the pot. If it tastes good then you are ok. If it tastes strange put it into the pot longer or shorter. Do the same thing to the mushroomshrimpscarrot and ham. Put all of these Tempura into a bowl.
3. Potato salad stage:.?Put your potato into hot water so that you can peel the skin of the potato easily and heat your pot having hot water inside. Put your potato without the skin in a bowl and put the bowl in the pot. Heat your potato for a while and after it is heated take the bowl out and start mixing the potato. Cut out the vegetables left and the ham left and put them into the potato salad mix it well and you have your potato salad.
4. Arrangement Stage:.?Prepare a big plate that is big enough to put all of these things. First make a section for your omelette pour your ketchup fried rice there and then slowly cover the rice with your unscrambled egg. Choose another section for putting your Tempura's(the fried things you had with the vegetables and meats) arrange it neatly. Now scoop some of your potato salad into a small bowl and place it somewhere on the plate. Finally scoop your ice cream and put it into a bowl and place the bowl at the last part of your plate. Enjoy!
5. P.S You can miss some of those things in those different stages these are just basic things I recommend. ANd parents can eat the left overs of the potato salads and Tempura's. It sure is good :).,

instructions, 1. Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over low heat. When the oil just begins to warm add the garlic and anchovies and cook slowly stirring until the garlic becomes toasty brown and the anchovies dissolve about 10 minutes. Let cool completely.
2. Process the butter in a food processor until smooth and creamy. Add the cooled garlic-anchovy mixture and a pinch of salt. Process until well blended. Taste and add more salt if needed. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the parsley.
3. Refrigerate until firm enough to shape into a log. Put an 18-inch sheet of aluminum foil on your work surface. Spoon the butter down the center of the foil into a log about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Enclose in foil and twist the ends to make a sealed log like a Tootsie Roll.

instructions, 1. Place the rice in a bowl and add water to cover it generously. Swish the rice in the water in a single direction to rinse off residual starch. Drain the water refill the bowl and swish again. Repeat until the water is clear. Do not rub the rice together with your hands because it could break the grains.
2. Drain the rice and place in a medium saucepan fitted with a tight lid. Flatten the rice with a palm and without removing your hand add water until it just touches the middle and highest knuckle of your hand. This is the "Mt. Fuji" method. Cover and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-high and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the rice stand uncovered to plump for 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Meanwhile in a small non-reactive saucepan combine the vinegar mirin and sugar and heat over medium heat until hot about 5 minutes; do not allow the mixture to boil. Keep hot.
4. Invert the rice into a large stainless steel or wooden bowl. Don't include any browned rice that may have formed at the bottom of the pan. Using a wooden or rubber spatula gently fold half of the vinegar mixture into the rice. Use a light lifting motion to avoid mashing the rice. Taste; the rice should have a pleasingly sweet-acidic edge. If necessary fold in more of the vinegar mixture.
5. Dampen a clean dish towel. With your hands gently push the rice together to form a loose mound. (Rice that is spread out would become dry.) Cover with the towel and allow the rice to rest for 20 minutes to develop its flavor. The rice is now ready to use.,

instructions, 1. Drain the two cans of tuna of oil or water and empty meat into a frying pan. If the tuna was in water you might want to add a little bit of olive/sesame/peanut oil (whichever you prefer). Start cooking.
2. In a separate bowl mix the soy sauce sugar and mayonnaise. Mayonnaise will probably be chunky and that's okay - it will melt with the heat.
3. When the tuna gets drier add the sauce and stir to make sure all the tuna gets a good coating. Cook until all the fluid is gone.
4. (A word on mayonnaise - if you use American mayonnaise this recipe has a different flavor than if you had used Japanese mayonnaise. Japanese mayonnaise is made from rice vinegar (instead of white distilled vinegar) and is less fatty. Because I don't have easy access to Japanese mayonnaise I add a dash of rice vinegar in with the sauce and that helps.).

3. Divide the dough into 25 pieces (you can do this by forming a long log and cutting it or just divide it up in the bowl and eyeball it).
4. Make each piece into a little round ball. It doesn’t have to be perfect in shape - a little bumpiness is fine.
5. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add salt as you would for boiling pasta.
6. Add the dumplings a few at a time to the pot. After a few minutes the dumplings will come floating to the surface.
7. Boil for a further 3-4 minutes then scoop out with a slotted spoon or similar.

11. While you’re grilling the dumplings make the mitarashi sauce.
12. Combine all the ingredients for the sauce in a small pan and bring to a boil.
13. Cook until the sauce has thickened. The more it cools the more viscous it will get. You can make the sauce in advance too.
14. Pour the sauce over the still warm skewered dumplings. They are best eaten right away but you can make them in advance too as long as you bring them to room temperature before eating.,

4. While waiting for the dough to steam peel the mango and cube it for the filling.
5. Test for doneness when a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.
6. Take pan out and let cool for 10 to 15 minutes
7. Lay cornstarch onto a wide working surface to avoid the dough from sticking to the work surface.
8. Also generously cover hands with cornstarch.
9. While still warm scoop the dough out of the pan with a spoon covered in cornstarch and roll into medium size balls.
10. Flatten the dough ball and place a mango cube in the middle.
11. Close the ball tightly and place on a plate that is dusted with cornstarch.
12. Repeat until all of the dough is used.
13. Lightly brush the balls with water and then gently sprinkle the shredded coconut onto the balls.
14. (note:when rolling the balls from the dough this part is the hardest. It is very sticky and some what difficult to work with. The cooler the dough is the harder the dough will be to work with. Also the more cornstarch you have on your hands and use the less it will stick to you and the dough will be easier to work with. But you can also try to line your steamer pan with a cheesecloth and then when it is ready just lay the dough onto a cutting board that has been generously sprinkled with cornstarch and roll it into a log and then slice the dough from that instead of doing it in the procedure above. This would be easier and less messy. Also it would be better to use a ripe mango so the filling will be really nice and sweet).,

instructions, 1. The pork stock:
2. Put water in a large pot and bring to a boil.  Add the pork bone garlic and spring onion; bring back to a boil.
3. Reduce heat as needed and boil for 3 hours occasionally skimming the top.
4. After 3 hours strain out the onion garlic bone and any particles etc.
5. The pork:
6. Place the meat in the pork soup after it has been strained and let it simmer for about one hour. Skim the tops of the both pot occasionally as needed.
7. When the meat becomes soft turn off the heat and remove it from the water.
8. In a separate pot place the soy sauce the mirin the Worcestershire sauce and the ginger. Add the meat and place over medium heat.
9. Cook for about 20 minutes flipping occasionally so that the meat absorbs the soy flavor.
10. Remove the brisket to a cutting board and reserve the boiling soup. Slice the meat into pieces about 2 inches long 1 inch wide and 1/2 inch thick.
11. To assemble the ramen soup:
12. In a large pot bring enough hot water to cover the ramen to a boil.  Boil the noodles for 1-2 minutes after they separate.  (You should also blanch the bean sprouts at this time.).
13. Meanwhile place 1-2 tablespoons of the reserved soy mixture from the pork into each bowl.
14. Drain the ramen and place an equal amount in each bowl.  (I think you let the noodles sit in the flavoring mixture for 7-8 minutes to absorb the flavor.).
15. Fill the bowls to about 2/3 with the simmering pork stock.
16. Make little hills "to heaven height" on top of the ramen soup with the coconut at the bottom and the green onion at the top.  Spread 3-4 slices of the pork meat on top in a decorative fashion.
17. Enjoy!  Although if you're like me you'll have to wait 10 minutes for the soup to cool to an edible temperature.,

instructions, 1. Rinse/Wash hijiki in a bowl to remove sand.  Soak the hijiki 10-15 minutes in enough water to cover.   Drain the hijiki over a colander; sqeezing out the excess water.  if strands are long you might want to cut it (to about 1/2 inch doesn't have to be exact).
2. Soak the mushrooms in warm water till soft then slice thin (keep the water).
3. Sauté the hijiki aburage carrots mushroomsedamane beans and konnyaku  in sesame oil for a few minutes.
4. Add soaking water and enough fresh water to almost cover. Add dashi and other seasonings.  Simmer until the hijiki and vegetables are tender and most of the liquid is absorbed (about thirty-five minutes).
5. Place in small serving bowl and garnish with toasted sesame seeds.
6. NOTE:  There have been some warnings citing more than citing its more than accepted levels of inorganic arsenic. It should be noted that the initial tests on hijiki which lead to those warnings in the UK among other places was based on testing the dried un-soaked hijiki - and you never eat hijiki that way. Soaking reduces the amount of trace arsenic by 1/7th; rinsing and cooking it in liquid further reduces it. The report here by the Tokyo Health and Welfare Department states that as long as a person weighing 50kg (about 110lb) does not eat more than 5 servings of hijiki of 5g dry weight per serving (which swells up to a lot more than that when soaked) that it is perfectly safe even for pregnant women.,

instructions, 1. Add the sake and mirin to a heavy bottomed pot and bring to a boil for about 10-15 minutes to burn off the alcohol.  Next turn down the heat and stir in the sugar and miso.  Cook until it turns a pale caramel color.  Remove from heat and allow it to cool completely.
2. To prepare the fish it first needs to be defrosted.  Once that's done rinse in cold running water and then pat dry with a clean paper towel.
3. Place into a Ziploc® bag.  I add the miso marinade and then let this sit in the refrigerator for 48-72 hours.
4. **72 hours later**    Remove your filet from the Ziploc® bag.
5. Add about a tablespoon of vegetable oil to a skillet which is on medium-low heat.  Add your fish to the pan.   Cook for about 4-5 minutes turn then cook for another 4-5 minutes you're ready to serve.
6. Serve with hot rice and maybe some tsukimono salad greens and miso soup.
7. NOTE:  My friend's comment:  If you bake the fish in a foil lined container ……… no mess; works in a toaster oven too.  If you like that the skin to be crispy bake until turns black.  You can also do this on a grill by wrapping the fish in tin foil but to make skin crispy you have to fry it after taking it off the grill.,

instructions, 1. Dissolve the salt in the water. Set aside.
2. In a very large bowl that you’ll be able to knead the dough in add the flour and make a little well in the center.  Add the salted water.
3. Use the fork to pull a little bit of flour into the liquid and then start to use your hands to work the moistened flour into the rest of the flour. Depending on the moisture content of your flour you might need to add a bit more water. As the dough comes together it should form into a lumpy ball. If it is too ragged sprinkle in a bit more water and work it into the dough.
4. Start seriously kneading the dough as hard as you can for about 10 minutes on a board dusted with bread flour. If the dough is too sticky knead in a touch more of the bread flour. To knead fold over from the top and use the heel of your palm to press it flat again. Turn the dough 45 degrees and repeat.
5. Form the dough into a ball dust it lightly with flour and seal it in a large - at least one gallon - zip lock bag.  Unzip the bag just slightly on one side so air can escape.
6. Wrap the bag in a large dish towel. Set it on the ground and stand on it. Be careful - the combination of plastic and towel can be slippery!  Move around do a little dance hop up and down take a stroll. Your whole body weight on the dough will work it like your hands never could. This helps make the noodles good and chewy.
7. After a few minutes take the dough out of the bag. It will be pretty flat but with a rolling pin roll out any irregularities. Then fold it in thirds dust it lightly with flour put it back in the bag wrap it in the towel and walk on it some more. Repeat this process about 4 times. Then leaving the dough in the bag let it rest for 3 hours in a warm place.
8. After it’s had a chance to rest walk on it one more time making a point to try to spread the dough as much as possible. The thinner you can get it by walking on it the easier the rest of the process will be.
9. Take the dough out from the bag and roll it out on a floured surface until it is a square about 1/8-inch thick. The dough may be pretty stiff and springy so this may be a bit challenging. If you can’t seem to get it thin enough with a rolling pin or if you want a more refined udon cut it into 4 pieces and run it through the thickest setting of a pasta machine and give them a good dusting of flour.  Or if you have the time cover the dough with a damp (not wet) towel and let it rest for half an hour then continue rolling.
10. Next dust the dough lightly with flour fold it from the top to the center and then from the center to the bottom (like an accordian). Then with one of the long edges facing you slice off the dough in 1/8-inch pieces. Dust the sliced pieces with a bit more flour as you go to prevent them from sticking.
11. Boil the noodles immediately in a large pot of boiling water covering them with a towel while you are waiting for the water to come to a boil. The noodles will need to boil for about 7 minutes stirred with a chopstick to prevent them from sticking together.
12. Traditionally the noodles are served hot with a dashi-based stock. But they are also delicious stir fried with a splash of sesame oil oyster sauce soy sesame seeds and some vegetables or meat of your choice.,

2. Prepare your veggies while the rice is cooking.
3. Once the rice is done put it in a bowl and season to taste with rice vinegar and sugar - the mixture should be pleasantly sweet and sour. Spread up the edges of the bowl to cool for a couple of minutes.
4. Lay down a nori sheet on a rolling mat. Using a spoon dipped in water spread the rice (min. 1/2 in / 1.5 cm thick) on the nori leaving a strip of about 2 in / 5cm at the far side of the sheet facing away from you.
5. Use a teaspoon to spread some plum sauce down the middle of the rice. Top with 1-2 slices of cucumber carrots avocado and green onion each depending on size of the veggies you cut (they need to spread all along the middle of the rice from end to end).
6. Using your mat roll up the nori pressing down with your hands as you roll to keep the roll firm.
7. Set the rolls on a plate with the bare strip of nori facing down. The moisture from the rice will seal the rolls. Let sit to firm up.
8. Using a sharp knife cut the ends of the rolls and eat immediately ; )
9. Cut the rest of the rolls into neat bite sized pieces and serve with the wasabi and pickled ginger and soy sauce for dipping - you may want to let your guests decide on how much wasabi to use especially if they are French : ).,

cuisine, Asian >> Japanese >> Japanese, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Step 1: Have the butcher separate the pork hock bones.
2. Step 2: Rinse well in running water to wash off blood. Boil in large pot for 15 minutes. You want to barely cover the bones with water.
3. Step 3: Skim off as much scum as possible as it forms.
4. Step 4: Drain in colander and use a brush to remove any bloody meat.
5. Step 5: Use a saw and saw halfway down the center of the bones. Then use hammer to break bone.
6. Note: I didn’t have to break the bones since my butcher’s pork hocks already had the marrow exposed.
7. Step 6: The bones will be filled with marrow. Simmer for several hours until the marrow dissolves out from the bones.
8. Step 7: Scum will form at the start. Carefully skim the scum off. On mid flame maintain a low boil.
9. Step 8: After scum has stopped forming simmer for 6 hours or more. Add more water if the water level drops.
10. Step 9: Making the noodles. After measuring out the ingredients mix the flour and kansui together then add the water. It may feel as if the amount of water is insufficient. This is normal.
11. Step 10: Mix in bowl until a mealy consistency is achieved.
12. Step 11: The dough will be very stiff. Use you body weight to form the dough into a ball.
13. Step 12: Transfer to kneading surface and knead. Knead vigorously for 10 minutes. It is ok if the dough cracks or does not knead together well.
14. Step 13: Form into ball cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Make sure that the dough does not dry out.
15. Step 14: While the dough rests prepare the char siu. Brown the meat in a pan and then simmer in a pot for 2 hours in a sauce made from the remaining ingredients. Allow to cool in the pot.
16. Step 15: After the dough has rested roll the dough out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 5 mm and then insert into pasta machine. Start out with the highest thickness and then continue on the lower settings until the desired thickness is achieved.
17. Step 16: If a pasta machine is not used roll out the dough to the desired thickness with the rolling pin. Take into account that the noodles will expand 1.3 times when boiled.
18. Step 17: The dough will not be that sticky so a small amount of flour or potato (or corn) starch is sufficient for flouring. (Note that the recipe only shows the noodles being cut by a pasta machine and does not mention hand cutting).
19. Step 18: A wooden box is best for storing the noodles but if one is not available use a metal tray lined with wax paper (to prevent sticking) and store in the refrigerator.
20. Step 19: 2 hours after the pork bones have started simmering the soup should become progressively white and cloudy. If tasted at this stage the soup will not taste good since it will still have a raw flavor.
21. Step 20: After the soup has simmered for 6 hours The inside of the bones should now be empty and the soup should have a rich smell just like a ramen place.
22. The stock is rich. It exactly like the picture it’s not a clear stock at all. Just remember that it won’t have much taste right now because there’s no salt. But don’t adjust the seasoning until the end of the recipe because you’re adding soy sauce to the ramen base.
23. Step 21: The char siu should be a nice amber color. Slice with care since it will be very tender and tend to fall apart.
24. Step 22: Any leftovers can be eaten with beer.
25. LOL But I will add that if you ever have trouble slicing soft pork chill the whole piece in the refrigerator until cold and it makes slicing easier. Reheating is easy in either the microwave or oven even stove top.
26. Step 23: It’s time to put everything together. Since boiling time can differ boil the noodles to each person’s preference. For people who like curly noodles firmly squeeze the noodles until the desired effect is achieved.
27. Step 24: Warm the bowl and add the char siu sauce and salt for flavor. Use sparingly at first and then add more if desired.
28. Step 25: I prefer to boil the noodles for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Your rich and hearty tonkotsu ramen is complete.
29. Notes:
30. Okay because final assembly occurred I prepared some soy sauce marinated eggs the night before.
31. Here’s what I did:
32. Ingredients:
33. 12 eggs in shells.
34. Diced pork hock meat (leftovers from recipe above) 1 lb.
35. 3 green onions cut into 1 inch pieces.
36. 1 thumb sized piece of ginger sliced.
37. 2 large cloves of garlic sliced.
38. 1/2 cup soy sauce.
39. 2 Tablespoons cooking wine/sake/sherry.
40. 2 Tablespoons Sugar.
41. 1/2 cup water.
42. Step 1: Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. (Using a small thumb tack I prick a pin hole in the base (fat end) of every egg but that’s not necessary.) The the water is at a full boil I put the eggs inches The water should cover the eggs. Wait for the water to come back to a full boil and time for 7 minutes. (9 minutes will give you a fully hard boiled egg. 7 minutes is a very soft boiled egg.) Drain the pot and eggs and plunge the eggs in ice water to stop cooking. This also makes the shells a bit easier to peel.
43. Step 2: In a small pot saute pork garlic onions and ginger until slightly browned. Add soy sauce cooking alcohol sugar water and simmer for 10 minutes. Until pork is cooked through and flavors meld. Remove from stove. Remove pork to eat separately. Pour everything else into a bowl large enough to hold marinade and eggs.
44. Step 3: Carefully peel the eggs and place in marinade. Try to make sure the marinade covers all of the eggs. If not try transferring the sauce into a large ZipLock bag and place the eggs in the bag and seal. Place the bag in a bowl and put everything in the refrigerator overnight. Or at least for a few hours.
45. Soy sauce eggs ready!
46. I usually cut them in half before adding them to the ramen bowl. You can reheat the eggs quickly in the stock before you assemble the ramen.,

instructions, 1. Rinse and swirl sushi rice in a good quality pot that takes about 4 times its volume; drain in a strainer or sieve. Do this three times and return the rice to the pot. Add the cooking water.
2. Bring the rice and water to the boil on high heat. Immediately reduce the heat to the lowest setting place the lid tightly on the pot set your timer/cellphone/watch to 20 minutes and DO NOT REMOVE THE LID FOR EVEN A MOMENT.
3. In the meantime make the sushi-su (rice vinegar mix). Mix the rice wine vinegar sugar and salt in a bowl and microwave for a minute or so. Stir until the sugar and salt have dissolved. Also use this time to prepare your other ingredients.
4. When your timer goes off after 20 minutes turn the heat to zero STILL DO NOT REMOVE THE LID and set your timer/cellphone/watch to another 20 minutes.
5. After 20 minutes YOU MAY REMOVE THE LID! and turn the rice out into a large bowl - glass ceramic wood or plastic only.
6. When it has cooled for a few minutes use a large blunt implement such as a flat-ended wooden spoon to make some gentle but deep incisions into the rice and pour half the sushi-su all over and into the cooling rice.
7. Gently turn the rice with your implement taking care not to make it stickier. Make a few more incisions and pour the rest of the vinegar. Turn gently again as you allow the sushi rice to cool to body temperature before starting to make your sushi.
8. Bonus tip 1: While making sushi keep a bowl of clean slightly warm water next to you and frequently wet your hand as you spread the sushi rice onto the nori (with nori rough-side up) to prevent it sticking to your hand.
9. Bonus tip 2: Make everyday sushi with ingredients you already have on hand. Vegetarian maki rolls are fabulous and can include carrot (shavings or fine sticks) avocado (thinly sliced) cucumber (thinly sliced lengthwise small Mediterranean cucumbers are best with lower water content than English cucumbers) sesame seed (dry-toasted) spring onion (green onion or scallion) sweet red orange or yellow pepper (pimento finely sliced lengthwise) firm juicy-fleshed fruit such as strawberry and melon and of course wasabi and Japanese Kewpie Doll mayonnaise.
10. Bonus tip 3: Only dip in Kikkoman soya sauce. Tens of thousands of sushi chefs around the world can't be wrong.,

cuisine, Asian >> Japanese >> Japanese, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. Before you start cooking you will need to prepare the rice ahead of time. Wash the brown rice 1-2 times then soak in water for 3 hours. I've used brown rice to make this rice ball but you can also use Japanese white rice. If using white rice you only need to soak it in water for 30 minutes before using.
2. Prepare the dried kelp or kombu by soaking it in water 15-20 minutes before using.
3. Prepare the rice seasonings by combining a tablespoon each of awamori mirin and soy sauce plus a cup of water. If you can not find awamori which is an Okinawan rice wine you can use sake.
4. Use a strainer to drain the rice for about about 5 minutes. Put it in a heavy-bottomed pot then pour the liquid mixture.
5. Turn on the heat using medium then put the pot with its lid on top.
6. Bring the liquid to a boil. Once it boils reduce the heat to low then simmer until most of the water evaporates.
7. Turn off the heat then keep the pot covered for another 10 minutes. Never open the pot while cooking the rice. Keep it covered especially after you've turned off the heat. Frequently opening the pot will prolong the cooking process and the rice may not cook completely.
8. Remove the lid then mix the rice. Let it cool until you can hold the rice at the palm of your hands. While waiting for the rice to cool you can cook the shio-kombu filling.
9. Start by preparing the kombu seasoning by mixing 3 tablespoons of soy sauce 3 tablespoons of mirin a tablespoon of sake and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Mix the ingredients well until the sugar is dissolved.
10. Heat a pan using medium. Use a strainer to drain the soaked kombu then put it in the pan. Add the seasoning mixture then bring the liquid to a boil while stirring occasionally.
11. Once it boils reduce the heat to low then cook until the liquid evaporates.
12. Once most of the liquid is gone add a tablespoon each of soy sauce mirin and sugar. Stir well and cook until the liquid is reduced to half then remove from the heat source. Let it cool before you start to make the rice ball.
13. Start by wetting your hands with water. It would be helpful if you prepare a bowl of water and a clean towel near you when making onigiri. The water will prevent the rice from sticking to your hands while the towel can be used to wipe your hands.
14. Spoon out about a handful of seasoned rice and put it at the top of the palm of your hands.
15. Put about a teaspoon of the shio kombu in the middle then press the rice so the filling will be covered with rice in the middle. You can form a ball-like shape onigiri with the shio kombu filling in the middle.
16. Use one palm of your hand to support the base of the onigiri. The other hand will help to shape the onigiri into a somewaht-traingular shape. Press firmly but not too much. Just enough so that the onigiri will hold its shape and will not break. Do not press firmly as the rice might become hard when the rice ball cools down completely.
17. Cut out a rectangle from the nori sheet big enough so that it will reach the middle part of each side of the rice ball holding the base. Press the nori sheet onto the rice ball then wait for it to stick with the rice then you can serve.,

4. To make the rice ball you will first need to wet your hands with water. It would be helpful if you prepare a bowl of water and a clean towel near you when making onigiri. The water will prevent the rice from sticking to your hands while the towel can be used to wipe your hands.

instructions, 1. Rinse and drain your short grain brown rice.  Add the rice to a medium size saucepan along with the dash of salt and 2 1/3 cups water.  (Yes that too much water for the rice but you'll add the quinoa to it as well later on).  Bring to a boil reduce heat to low and cover the pan.  Set your timer for 30 minutes.
2. While the rice cooks you can mix up the vinegar(s) mirin sugar and salt.  I like to heat this up so that the sugar and salt fully dissolve.  Set aside.
3. Also while the rice cooks you can cut up your filling (grate the carrot slice up the cucumber and avacado).  Set aside.
4. At the 30 minute mark add in the quinoa and give it a quick stir.  You may have to bring it back up to a boil to maintain the heat then reduce back down to low and cover again.  Set your timer for 15 more minutes.  At the end of the 15 minutes both the rice and the quinoa should be tender and nicely cooked.
5. Remove your rice mixture from the pan.  You can turn it into a large mixing bowl or even onto a cookie sheet.  Spread it out so that it cools more quickly.  Mix in the vinegar mixture carefully folding it into the rice.  I like to use a rice paddle (flat sort of spoon) fanning it out as you go to help the rice cool off.  Adjust the seasoning if need be adding more vinegar if you like.  (I wouldn't add more salt because you generally serve with soy sauce).
6. After about 10 minutes the rice should have cooled off quite a bit and be ready to work with.  (You could prepare this far in advance remembering it's best to work with the rice at room temperature).
7. Cover up your sushi mat with plastic wrap or a clear plastic bag (I put it inside a large ziploc).  Place a sheet of nori on your mat (shiny side down).
8. Eyeball your rice mixture into 4 equal portions and place one portion on your sheet of nori.  Pat it down with damp hands to cover the lower half of the nori sheet with rice.  There is usually a picture on the back of the nori packaging to show you how to spread the rice and roll it up.  I like to keep a mug of water nearby to dip my fingers into.
9. If you wish spread a thin layer of mayo across the rice with the option of adding a little wasabi to the mayo.  Another option is to sprinkle the rice with sesame seeds or Gomasio at this point.  Place your fillings in a straight line across the middle of your rice.  Lift the sushi mat and fold over and roll to form a log.  This might take practice if it's your first time but basically connect the bottom of the sheet closest to you to the top of the rice mixture which should result in your filling being perfectly in the middle (or not! -- still tastes good!).  Use the mat to help you tighten up the sushi log then release it.
10. Repeat to use up all the rice and you should have 4 sushi logs.  With a very sharp knife (I like a bread knife myself) cut each log into 6 or 8 equal pieces.
11. Serve with wasabi picked ginger and light soy sauce.  Enjoy!,

5. **Making an with canned aduki beans - It adds a couple of hours to the prep time to make the an yourself but it can be difficult to find if you don't have a good Asian market nearby or you may want to make it yourself so that you can control the sweetness (I make it myself for both reasons). Drain and rinse 2 (15 oz) cans aduki beans (I found them at the whole grocer; kidney beans work in a pinch but they won't be exactly the same). Bring to a boil with enough water to cover by 1-inch and 1-2 cups of your favorite sweetener (I use 1 1/4 cups raw sugar). Reduce heat and simmer until the beans are soft (just starting to fall apart) and there is little water left (add more water if it cooks off before the beans are done - about 90 minutes). At this point you have Tsubu-an (red beans simmered with sugar).
6. For tsubushi-an (red beans simmered with sugar and mashed): roughly process the beans in a food processor (or mash with a potato masher) adding water if needed to bring the beans to a paste consistency. I add half of the an to the dessert at this point and press the rest.
7. For koshi-an (red beans simmered with sugar and mashed with husks removed): Strain tsubushi-an through a sieve to remove the bean husks and make the paste smoother.,

instructions, 1. Place 1 cup of tempura batter mix into a bowl and add 1/2 cup of water along with all of the spices listed above. Whisk everything together until thick or a pancake batter consistency.
2. Cut avocado's in half then slice into half inch slices lengthwise.
3. Pour 2 cups of canola oil (or your oil of choice) into a frying pan and turn the heat to Medium (7). You can also use a deep fryer.
4. While waiting for the oil to heat up Coat the avocado slices with the tempura batter. You may want to use two forks to toss them back and forth if you don't want to get too messy. But since avocados are quite fragile and slippery the two-fork method is much more manageable and cleaner for me. Otherwise you may also use your hands if you want :).
5. By this time the oil should be hot enough to start frying the avocado's. Cooked when golden brown.
6. To make the teriyaki-lemon dipping sauce: combine 1/2 cup of kewpie japanese mayo (or light mayo if you don't have) 1/4 cup of kikkoman teryiaki sauce and a squeeze of lemon juice. Adding wasabi is also optional for those who like it spicy. mix well.
7. When avocado's are cooked golden brown place them on some paper towels to absorb excess oil. Feel free to double fry them for extra crunchiness!
8. Serve with teriyaki-lemon dipping sauce.,

7. Notes:  If you see bubbles as soon as you put a wooden chop stick into the oil this is too hot.  If you see them after 2 seconds it's just the right temperature.  After  deep-frying the meat about 7~8 minutes make the flame stronger.

2. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper then add the honey and soy sauce.  Stir all together with the spatulas.  Let the ingredients cook stirring every 1-2 minutes until the chicken pieces get a brown crust on at least one of their sides (5-7 minutes).  Once the chicken begins to crust make sure you watch carefully so they do not burn.  When the chicken has a nice brown crust and the juices that run from them when pierced run clear remove the chicken to a plate and set aside.  Take the wok or skillet off the heat and wipe out with a paper towel.  Be careful!

instructions, 1. For a more detailed description with step by step photos please visit: http://sumokitchen.com/JapaneseRecipes/spring-rolls/.
2. If you are using dry shiitake soak them at least 30 minutes in water to return them to fresh state. Boil the bamboo shoots for 1 minute then drain to get rid of the smell. Chop the meat shiitake bamboo shoots and leek thinly.Add a little oil to the pan and fry the meat until it changes colour. Then add the chopped ingredients from step one stirring add a pinch of salt and pepper and the sugar. Add the soy sauce and sesame oil. In a separate bowl add 2tbs potato starch to 2tbs water (make sure it’s cold water!) and mix. Then add to the frying pan mix and heat through until sticky. Leave to cool – if you have time place in the fridge. When you deep fry the rolls they’s less chance of them exploding if the insides are cold.Mix 1tbs flour and 1tbs water well to create a glue. Then add a small portion of the meat mix to a sheet of the spring roll paper which should be lying at an angle like a diamond. Then follow the folding steps as above using the glue on the tip of your finger to seal it at the final stage.Heat oil to roughly 180 degrees and start frying the rolls carefully until golden. Then lay out on kitchen paper to let the oil soak up before serving. If you have spring rolls sheets left over you can add tuna ham cheese or any other filling. Another idea is to cut up the sheets thinly then deep fry them and put in salads to give some crunch.
3. If you’d like dipping sauce I recommend 1part rice vinegar with 1 part soy sauce or just black vinegar on its own.,

instructions, 1. Trim off any fat or sinews on the chicken breasts. You may want to cut them in half if they are much bigger than half a pound each.
2. In a sturdy ziplock bag or vacuum sealing bag combine honey and salt.
3. Put the chicken breasts in one by one and squish them around in the bag to completely coat them completely with the honey-salt mixture.
4. At this point you can add the black pepper and/or any herbs or spices that you like to the bag with the chicken.
5. Squeeze out as much air as you can or suck the air out with your vacuum packing appliance. Seal the bags and leave the chicken to marinate in the refrigerator for 48 hours or 2 full days.
6. Once they are done marinating soak in plenty of cold water for 1 hour. This soaking process gets rid of excess salt or de-salinates them while still leaving enough salt in them so that they are nicely flavored.
7. After washing and soaking the chicken breasts wipe off any excess moisture with paper towels. You can roll up the chicken breasts and tie them up with kitchen twine to get a nice round shape or just leave the breasts as-is.
8. Poach or bake the chicken.
9. Poaching method:  Put the chicken into the hot and barely simmering water. Cook for 5 minutes then put a tight fitting lid on the pot and turn the heat off. Leave the chicken to poach for at least an hour. Some people recommend leaving the chicken in until the water has cooled down.
10. Oven method:  Preheat the oven to 120 °C / 250 °F. Yes it’s quite a low temperature - you’ll be cooking the chicken slowly so that it doesn’t get dried out. Line a baking sheet with kitchen cooking parchment or a non-stick baking liner or lightly oil the sheet.  Put the breasts on the lined baking sheet. Bake the chicken breasts for 35 to 40 minutes until the surface is a very light brown.Take the chicken out and leave to cool on a plate.,

instructions, 1. Slice the chicken breasts into thin bite-size pieces. Trim the scallions and leeks then cut them into 2-inch lengths. Drain the grilled bean curd (it usually comes packed in water) and cut it in half lengthwise then across 3 or 4 times to yield 8-10 bite-sized blocks. Rinse the mushrooms under cold water and trim off the dark yellow and brown roots (attached to fresh mushrooms). Peel or scrape the fresh burdock root cut it into shavings (slender matchsticks) and soak them in cold water for a few minutes before draining. Or drain canned burdock root and blanch it for 10 seconds then drain again and cut it into shavings.Rinse and dry the greens and trim off any roots or flowering buds. If the stalks are longer then 4-5 inches cut them in half. Cook the noodles if using and drain them well. Arrange all your ingredients attractively on a large platter or tray and bring it to the table.
2. In a large pot combine the dashi soy sauce mirin and sugar. Heat while stirring to melt the sugar. Bring the seasoned broth to a boil then lower the heat slightly to maintain a steady simmer. Add half the solid ingredients (chicken slices scallions leeks bean curd mushrooms and burdock root) and simmer 4-5 minutes. Add half the green leaves cover and cook another minuet or two. Have everyone help himself to what he likes then replenish the pot with the remaining meat and vegetables and cook them as you did before. When all has been eaten add the optional cooked and drained noodles and heat them through for a minute serving some to each person with the soup from the pot.,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 400.
2. Make sure the butter is softened (but not melted!) then mix it with the other CRUST ingredients.
3. Beat these ingredients well with an electric mixer it may appear very crumbly at first if the butter wasn't very soft. If that's the case let it sit for a few minutes to let the butter soften then beat again it should have a very smooth consistency and wonderful smell.
4. Smoosh the moist shortbread into an ungreased pie pan (see prep notes) so it is fully and evenly covered. Be sure to poke holes in the crust with a fork first so it gives it room to breathe.
5. Bake for 10-15 minutes then remove the pan and let it cool for 8-10 minutes-- the crust may have risen a bit if you didn't poke it first the cooling will naturally let it fall too. Let it cool as you mix the filling.
6. Meanwhile raise the oven temp to 450.
7. Beat the cream cheese and eggs together--followed by the vanilla lemon juice flour and sugar.
8. Mix in the vanilla yogurt. The mixture should have a runny consistency.
9. Strain the mixture carefully in a fine-net colander if your cream cheese wasn't too soft and clumps got in there.
10. Add in the matcha packets and blend on low speed. Use a wooden spoon or rubber scraper to get all the green tea powder bits off the sides of the bowl and make sure it's all thoroughly mixed.
11. Pour half the mixture into the pie pan (if making 2 cheesecakes) with your now cooked and cooled shortbread crust. If you're making just one large cheesecake pour the entire mixture inches.
12. Bake for 10 minutes. (If you're doing 2 cheesecakes--save the other half of the mixture in an airtight container and refridgerate.).
13. Lower the temperature to 300 and bake for 25-45 minutes according to your oven strength. I found that for the 8" cake this size in my convection oven I only needed about 25 minutes because the top was nice and brown and it hardly moved when I tried to pull it out of the oven. It needed 35 for the 10" cake. The cake should be set in the center that's how you'll know it's ready.
14. Pull the cake out and let it cool for 5-10 minutes-- but leave the oven on at 300.
15. In a medium sized bowl mix the the GLAZE by first putting the plain yogurt and vanilla together.
16. Add the sugar and mix well.
17. To fully incorporate the cocoa powder add the cocoa powder bit by bit (about 1/2 tsp at a time) and mix each time until there's no more cocoa left. You should have a bowl of what appears to be rich-looking chocolate mousse.
18. When the cheesecake is done cooling spread half of the chocolate glaze on top of the cheesecake (if doing the 2 cheesecake route use the whole thing if you're doing the one large cheesecake). If you're making 2 cheesecakes put the other half of the mixture in an airtight container and refridgerate.
19. Bake for another 10 minutes.
20. Turn the oven off and let the cheesecake sit in there for 45 min-1 hour.
21. Cover the cake(s) in foil then refridgerate for 2-3 hours.
22. Slice serve and enjoy!,

2. For the filling combine the pork shrimp soy sauce vegetable oil cilantro scallion mushroom sesame oil white pepper and 1/3 cup water in a medium bowl. Mix well. Cover and freeze for 1 hour (or refrigerate overnight) to firm the mixture and make it easier to handle.
3. Dissolve the cornstarch in 3 tablespoons cold water in a small bowl to make a paste. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper and sprinkle it with cornstarch. Moisten the edges of a dumpling wrapper by dipping your finger into the paste and running it over the edge of the wrapper. Using a blunt knife as a scoop place about a tablespoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper. Bring the edges of the wrapper up to meet at the top of the filling and pinch them closed squeezing the dough. Place the dumpling on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers. (The uncooked dumplings can be made ahead covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 1 day. Or freeze them for up to 3 months. To freeze place them in a single layer in a plastic storage container or plastic storage bag arranged so that the dumplings don't touch one another. When you are ready to cook them the frozen dumplings will be easy to remove one by one.).
4. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over high heat. Add the dumplings and cover the pan. Cook until the filling is cooked through and the dumplings are floating on top of the water about 4 minutes.
5. While the dumplings are cooking make the sauce: Heat a wok or medium skillet over high heat. Add the oil and heat until it shimmers. Add the scallions garlic and black pepper and stir-fry for 20 seconds. Transfer to a small bowl. Add the sugar vinegar hot bean paste soy sauce sesame oil and hot chile oil to the scallions and mix well. Divide the sauce among four soup bowls.
6. Carefully drain the dumplings in a colander. Place the dumplings on top of the sauce in the bowls and serve immediately.,

instructions, 1. The above ingredients can be found in a lot of regular grocery stores. But you will find them in just about any Asian grocery store. There are imitation mirins out there which are without alcohol they are fine but tend to be sweeter I would use less if buying these.
2. Cover one side of tuna completely with sesame seeds and place steaks back in fridge.
3. Combine all the other ingredients in a saucepan heat until blended and sugar has dissolved. Leave on low heat to keep warm.
4. Heat some olive oil in a fry pan place Tuna sesame seed side down cook for 4 minutes turn over and cook on the other side for a further 4 minutes. Tuna should be pink in the middle so vary cooking time for how thick the cut is. You can cook it all the way through if preferred but the tuna will be a lot drier and tough.
5. Serve tuna on plate with dipping sauce in separate small serving bowls.
6. I served mine with spinach topped with a roasted sesame seed dressing.

2. Mix flour and water/stock in a bowl 'til smooth.
3. For one okonomiyaki pancake heat the hotplate well and spread a ladle of the batter into a thin circle brown on one side (only takes a minute or two) turn and move it to side.
4. Put two rashers of bacon side by side cook a few minutes and then turn over. (Have them running across the hotplate rather than up and down as it makes it easier for lifting later).
5. Put a handful of shredded cabbage on top of bacon rashers followed by a handful of bean sprouts.
6. Put pancake on top of sprouts/cabbage and press down firmly with the spatula.
7. Drop one serve of noodles onto a different part of the hotplate shape into a circle (about the same size as the pancake) and flatten a little with spatula. Cook for a few minutes.
8. Slide a spatula (or two) under the bacon /cabbage /sprout pancake and carefully lift on top of the noodles. (Pretty easy as the two slices of bacon form a solid base.) Tuck any stray bits and pieces back under.
9. Break one egg in a cup add a little water mix with a fork and then pour onto the hotplate and fry it. Try to keep it in a circle.
10. Slide a spatula (or two) under the noodles and carefully lift the whole lot on top of the egg. (Pretty easy as the noodles should have crisped a little to form a solid base.) Again tuck any stray bits and pieces back under.  (So far so good and no flipping required yet!).
11. Time to put it on a plate egg side up. Either flip it over with a spatula or two or do it my sneaky way - slide spatula(s) under the egg and lift the whole lot onto a plate without flipping. Put a second plate upside down over the whole lot hold them together tightly and then just turn the two plates over quickly so that the okonomiyaki is sitting egg side up on the second plate. Easy.
12. Combine the barbecue sauce mayonnaise and Worcestershire sauce together and spread thinly over the egg or adopt the Osaka style of squeezing the mayonnaise and barbecue sauce out of squeeze bottles in a criss-cross pattern across the egg. Garnish with some chopped spring onions if you like.,

5. Cook each side for approximately 5 minutes or until golden brown.
6. Place in on the plate and top it with bonito flakes mayonaisse and lastly okonomiyaki sauce.
7. Reminder:
8. * since this is practically like 'throw everything in one bowl' type of food sometimes the mixture might be just a little bland. But no worries if it's bland just add salt.
9. -When making the mixture do not add in too much chicken broth. Add in salt instead approximately around 1/2 teaspoon or until taste.
10. -Just in case if anyone could not find the okonomiyaki sauce you might want to substitute it to barbecue sauce. I've not tried it with barbecue sauce yet but I hope it works.
11. -Okonomiyaki sauce is quite salty thus go easy on it.

instructions, 1. 1. We will begin by getting the rice ready. First make sure that you have a bag of "sushi" rice. I find that Nishiki brand sushi rice is readily available at most supermarkets. Measure out 1.5 cups of this sushi rice.
2. 2. Pour the rice into a metal strainer. Turn on your kitchen sink faucet and begin to rinse the rice underneath the water. I like to have a spoon on hand so that I can turn the rice while I'm rinsing it.
3. 3. Rinse under the faucet until the water is nearly clear (and no longer white).
4. 4. Sit the strainer of rice aside to dry for about one hour. You will notice a major improvement in the appearance of your cooked rice.
5. 5. While the rice is drying I move onto preparation of what will go inside the roll. First I get my frozen crab meat sticks (Kanimi makes a nice 14 oz. package). I place them in a room temperature plastic container full of water to let them thaw. You may need to change the water 2 or 3 times to make sure it doesn't get ice cold.
6. 6. While the rice is drying and the crab is thawing I prepare my vegetables. A typical California roll contains avocado and cucumber. Begin by peeling each vegetable. I use a standard peeler for the cucumber and a pairing knife for the avocado.
7. 7. Once peeled (and seed removed) do your best to cut the avocado into lengthwise wedges. They don't have to be perfect. Just try and make them long and skinny as opposed to short and fat. Keep these "avocado wedges" in a plastic container.
8. 8. For the cucumber keep the peeler handy. I go over the cucumber with the peeler just as if I were taking off the peel. In this case though keep the strips in a plastic container. These are your "cucumber strips".
9. 9. Get some cellophane and wrap your rolling mat with the cellophane. I usually go around it several times and both ways (across and up-and-down). This will make your mat non-stick.
10. 10. Measure out your 1/2 cup of rice vinegar. This is what will make your sushi rice "sticky" and allow it to retain its shape. Lay out a fork and a spoon next to your portion of rice vinegar. Also set out a large baking sheet and make sure you have something stiff that you can fan with (a magazine folder etc. will work fine).
11. 11. Remove three nori papers from the package. Cut them lengthwise so that you remove approximately an inch of paper from each. These papers tend to have a bit more nori than necessary.
12. 12. Once the crab is thawed I use kitchen shears to open the bag and cut the strips in half. I dump the pieces into a food processor and use the "pulse" function until the strips are turned into smaller minced pieces (quarter inch or less in length). Don't go too crazy or you may end up with crab meat "powder"!
13. 13. Remove the minced crab meat from the food processor and transfer it to a mixing bowl. Add about 8 tablespoons of Miracle Whip (or mayonnaise) and 2 teaspoons of salt. Mix this into the crab meat with a wooden spoon until the consistency is even. This is your "surimi".
14. 14. When your rice has sat about an hour measure out 2 cups of water and pour into a rice cooker. If you don't have a rice cooker a covered pot is fine. Add the rice into the water and press "cook". For a regular pot cook over a low flame for about 10 minutes.
15. 15. When rice has cooked 10 minutes (or rice cooker is done) turn off heat and allow rice to sit for about 10 more minutes.
16. 16. Spoon rice onto a baking sheet. Add a few spoonfuls of your rice vinegar over the top of the rice. Use a fork to fluff and stir the rice. The idea is to coat every grain with vinegar. While you are fluffing lightly fan the rice with whatever you have available. Repeat this process until you are out of the rice vinegar then fan a bit more for good measure. Your rice is now "sticky" rice -- or as the Japanese call it -- "sushi". Sushi is not raw fish but rather the rice!
17. 17. Turn your faucet on so that it is running cold water. Fill a cup with ice cold water and place a VERY sharp (not serrated) knife inside. I also like to keep a steel wool pad or Scotch pad handy. If you prefer to wear food preparing gloves feel free.
18. 18. Lay out one of your "cut" sheets of nori seaweed paper.
19. 19. Moisten your hands with cold water. Coat all but the back edge with about 1/4 inch of rice. You will probably need to rinse rice off of your fingers/hands a few times. That is why I keep cold water running and I work near a sink. This also prevents the rice from sticking to your fingers. Usually a ball of rice about the size of a baseball will cover most of the nori. Leave that back edge devoid of rice. That will eventually become your "seam".
20. 20. When you have your nori coated with 1/4 inch of rice sprinkle with sesame seeds. You can also add masago (orange fish eggs) if you prefer.
21. 20. Flip over your paper so that the rice is facing down and the seaweed is facing up. The edge without rice should be right next to you.
22. 21. Lay out avocado wedges end-to-end along the midline of your paper going from the left to the right edge. Add fingerfulls of surimi crab meat alongside the avocado wedges. Then lay out strips of cucumber along the other side of the surimi crab meat. You will notice that the crab meat is "confined" between the avocado line and the cucumber line.
23. 22. Lift up the edge of the mat near you and begin to roll the "riceless" end of the paper forward over the ingredients you laid out along the middle.
24. 23. When that edge makes contact with the seaweed paper (i.e. you have formed a circle) pull back on your mat a bit to tighten the roll. This will "seal" your seam (the point when the seaweed joins).
25. 24. Once you have pulled to seal the seam finish rolling until you run out of paper. This will "cover" your seam with a bit of extra rice so the seam doesn't come open as easily.
26. 25. Lay the roll out on a cutting board. Drape the mat over the top of it then crimp the edges underneath the roll and press down lightly. This is just one last way to preserve the roll's shape.
27. 26. With the mat still draped over the top of the roll align the edges of the mat with each edge of the roll. Lightly pat the edge of the roll with your palm to "flatten" them (i.e. no ingredients sticking way out).
28. 27. Get your ice cold sharp knife. Gently cut the roll down the center. By gently I mean do not even force it down with your arm strength. Only use your arm strength to "saw". Let the weight of the blade accomplish the downward cutting. If you press down while you cut your roll will be flat where you cut it. You want it to be round.
29. 28. After you cut it down the middle lay out the two halves next to each other. Rinse your blade off and I recommend brushing off the rice residue with a steel wool pad. That residue will only make it harder to cut on subsequent attempts so I find that it is best to get rid of it completely.
30. 29. With the two halves next to each other make 2-3 cuts across both halves -- again cutting very gently and rinsing the blade between cuts. Obviously more cuts produce thinner pieces. If you're a beginner you'll probably only feel comfortable making 2 cuts -- and you'll end up with super-filling thick roll pieces.
31. 30. In a lot of sushi restaurants they throw away the end pieces because they look bad compared to the middle pieces -- and I tend to agree. But you don't have to waste the food if you don't want to! Clearly you can see now that there is a certain "art" to sushi-making. It takes some time to get very good at it.
32. 31. Lay out your pieces on a plate. Serve with soy sauce and -- if available -- wasabe (adds a lot of spice to the soy sauce) and pickled ginger (can be eaten to cleanse the palate). Eat with chopsticks.,

2. Slice tofu in half lengthwise then quarter it by cutting it in half along the narrow sides. You will have four rectangles. Keep them together then begin slicing 1/4" slices from the narrow end. You should end up with lots of pieces that measure just over 1" long and about 3/4" wide.
3. Put these pieces on a plate sandwiched between paper towels and press them dry. This should get most of the water out.
4. Heat sesame oil in a deep skillet over low/medium heat.
5. Add ginger and garlic to the pan and lightly sautee for about 30 seconds. Do not scorch the garlic.
6. Add soy sauce and water.

9. Let the beef sit for about 10 minutes so that the cornstarch sticks.
10. As the beef sits heat up one cup of oil in a wok (you may also use a skillet for this step as long as the beef will be mostly covered with oil).
11. Heat the oil over medium heat until it's nice and hot but not smoking.
12. Add the beef to the oil and sauté for just two minutes or until the beef just begins to darken on the edges.

time, ,

instructions, 1. Trim the excess meat and fat away from the ends of the chop bones leaving them exposed.
2. Put the pork chops in a clean plastic bag and lightly sprinkle with water to prevent the meat from tearing when pounded.
3. Using the smooth side of a meat mallet pound the meat down to an even one-inch thickness being careful not to hit the bones.
4. Alternatively have your butcher cut thinner chops and serve two per serving.
5. To make the marinade combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well.
6. Coat the pork chops liberally with the marinade and marinate for three hours or up to overnight in the refrigerator.
7. Prepare mustard sauce.
8. Put the sugar and mustard in the top of a double boiler and mix with a whisk.
9. When well combined whisk in the egg yolks and vinegar.
10. Cook over simmering water stirring occasionally for 10 to 15 minutes until it is thick enough to form ribbons when drizzled from the spoon.
11. Remove from the heat and allow the mixture to cool.
12. When cool fold in the creme fraiche.
13. Keep refrigerated until needed.
14. Place the chops on the grill and grill for five minutes on each side rotating them a quarter turn after two to three minutes on each side to produce nice crosshatch marks. (It's good to baste with some of the marinade as the meat cooks).
15. As with all marinated meats you want to go longer and slower on the grill vs. shorter and hotter because if the marinated meat is charred it may turn bitter.
16. The pork is ready when it registers 139F on an instant-read thermometer.
17. Offer the mustard sauce on the side for dipping.,

instructions, 1. Make the sauce by heating 2 tsp of vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over med/low heat.
2. Don't get the oil too hot.
3. Add ginger and garlic to the pan and quickly add the soy sauce and water before the garlic scorches.
4. Dissolve the brown sugar in the sauce then raise the heat to about medium and boil the sauce for 2-3 minutes or until the sauce thickens.
5. Remove it from the heat.
6. Slice the flank steak against the grain into 1/4" thick bite-size slices (Tilt the blade of your knife at about a forty five degree angle to the top of the steak so that you get wider cuts).
7. Dip the steak pieces into the cornstarch to apply a very thin dusting to both sides of each piece of beef.
8. Let the beef sit for about 10 minutes so that the cornstarch sticks.
9. As the beef sits heat up one cup of oil in a wok (you may also use a skillet for this step as long as the beef will be mostly covered with oil).
10. Heat the oil over medium heat until it's nice and hot but not smoking.
11. Add the beef to the oil and sauté for just two minutes or until the beef just begins to darken on the edges.
12. You don't need a thorough cooking here since the beef is going to go back on the heat later.
13. Stir the meat around a little so that it cooks evenly.
14. After a couple minutes use a large slotted spoon to take the meat out and onto paper towels then pour the oil out of the wok or skillet.
15. Put the pan back over the heat dump the meat back into it and simmer for one minute.
16. Add the sauce cook for one minute while stirring then add all the green onions.
17. Cook for one more minute then remove the beef and onions with tongs or a slotted spoon to a serving plate.

2. Place a wok or heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When it is hot add the oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Toss in the garlic and stir-fry for 10 seconds then add the ginger. Stir-fry over medium-high to medium heat until slightly softened and starting to turn color.
3. Add the meat and use your spatula to break it up so there are no lumps at all then add the salt and stir-fry until most of the meat has changed color.
4. Add the soy sauce and vinegar and stir to blend. Add the warm water and stir. The dressing can be prepared ahead to this point and set aside for up to 20 minutes. When you are ready to proceed bring to a boil.
5. While the dressing mixture is coming to a boil place the cornstarch in a small cup or bowl and stir in the cold water to make a smooth paste.
6. Once the liquid is bubbling in the pan give the cornstarch mixture a final stir add to the pan and stir for about 1 minutes: the liquid will thicken and become smoother. Taste for salt and add a little salt or soy sauce if you wish. Add the sesame oil and stir once then pour onto the lettuce.
7. Immediately toss the salad to expose all the greens to the hot dressing. Serve immediately.,
