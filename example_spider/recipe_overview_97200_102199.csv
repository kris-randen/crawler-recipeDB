I use 3 or 4 pieces of dried beef depending on how much I have.  Make sure you don't put too much on the tortilla otherwise it won't roll well.
3. Cut in about 1/2 inch pieces.
4. Notes:  This should make about 8 roll-ups depending on how much cream cheese you spread on the tortilla.  You can use the bigger burrito-style tortillas.  There are many things you can subistute.  I used to use turkey and cheese instead of beef but people liked the beef better so I stopped making the turkey roll-ups.,

instructions, 1. In a small bowl whisk together the ginger garlic curry powder cornstarch salt sesame oil and 1 of the eggs. In a large bowl combine the beef bell pepper and scallions then stir in the ginger mixture until well combined. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
2. In a clean small bowl whisk the remaining egg with the water. Lightly brush a thin layer of the egg wash on a wonton wrapper. Use a measuring tablespoon to scoop 1 tablespoon of the beef filling into the center of the wrapper. Hold the filled wrapper in the palm of one hand and pull the sides of the wrapper up around beef with the other hand while slowly spinning the dumpling in your palm. You should be gently squeezing the wrapper around the beef and pushing the beef up so that it’s flush with the top of the wrapper; you’re not really pressing the filling just gently shaping it. The beef should be exposed on top and the whole dumpling should be in the shape of a wide cylinder.
3. Place wrapped dumplings on a wax paper- or plastic wrap- lined half sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining wrappers egg wash and beef filling. If you don’t want to cook them immediately cover tightly with plastic wrap and freeze for up to 1 month.
4. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add just enough dumplings so that you can space them 1 inch apart in a single layer. Cook until the bottoms are lightly browned about 2 minutes.
5. Add enough water to come 1/4 inch up the sides of the pan. Cover and cook until the water evaporates about 2 minutes. Again add enough water to come 1/4 inch up the sides of the pan. Cover and cook until the beef is cooked through about 2 minutes more. You can tell when the beef is done when the dumpling feels very firm. If you want to be sure cut one in half to check.,

2. Cut the tops off your Anaheim chili’s. Slice them in half lengthwise and remove the seeds. Depending on the size of your chili’s cut them in half or into thirds. You want strips about the same length as your onions.
3. Then cut them into strips like the onions about 1/4in. thick. Place your prepped veggies on a plate or in a bowl cover and set aside or refrigerate. We’ll get back to these later.
4. Next trim the fat off of your chuck steak. Dice into big cubes about 1 1/2-2 inch cubes. You’ll want them big so when it starts to break down you’ll still have nice chunks.
5. Add the salt pepper onion powder and garlic powder to a small bowl so it will be easy to add to the meat.
6. Preheat your pot to medium high heat. If you are using a non-stick pan you do not have to add the oil. If your pan is not non-stick you’ll want to add the oil to keep the meat from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Add your cubed meat to the hot pan along with your little bowl of seasoning.
7. Fry the meat stirring often until it has browned about 10-15 minutes or so.
8. Pour in enough water to barely cover the meat about 1/2 gallon or so.
9. Turn the heat to high and cover. Once the meat comes to a boil back the heat off until you have a “hard simmer”. This means that the liquid is bubbling but not boiling over. You want to have it bubbling as hard as possible covered without it boiling over. Cook it for about 2-3 hours stirring occasionally.
10. Note: You want a very tight fitting lid because you don’t want the liquid to evaporate too quickly. If you notice the liquid evaporating fast you may need to add more water so keep this in mind.
11. After 2-3 hours poke the meat to see if it is starting to break up. If it is remove the lid turn the heat down “just a little” and keep simmering until most of the liquid has evaporated. If it is not breaking down yet just put the lid back on and continue simmering until it is breaking up.
12. The point here is to keep as much liquid in your pot until the meat starts to break up. Only at this point do you want to remove the lid and let the liquid evaporate. This will ensure your meat is extremely tender and falling apart. All together the meat will take about 3 1/2-4 hours. Keep monitoring your meat and stirring during the last hour.
13. Machaca Beef ShreddedOnce the liquid has almost completely evaporated use a wood spoon to break the meat down. You don’t want to completely shred it with your spoon just to the point where some of the meat is shredded but you still have some nice chunks. At this point the meat is ready for the next step onions and chili’s… Yum!
14. Adding Your Chili’s And Onions To The Machaca.
15. Preheat a very large skillet to medium high heat preferably non-stick (if you don’t have non-stick you’ll need about a teas. of oil).
16. Add your prepped veggies to the dry pan (if you’re using non-stick) and grill them until they’re just tender about 2-4 minutes.
17. Turn the heat off and add your warm beef Machaca Finishedand stir until thoroughly mixed. That’s it your meat is now ready.,

2. 1.
3. The Day Before: Using butcher's twine tie tenderloin at 1-inch intervals using butcher's knots. Season generously with salt and pepper. Transfer to a wire rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate uncovered at least overnight and up to 2 nights.
4. When Ready to Cook: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 225°F (107°C). Place baking sheet with rack and tenderloin in oven and roast until internal temperature registers 120 to 125°F (49 to 52°C) on an instant-read thermometer 2 to 3 hours. Remove from oven and set aside at room temperature for 10 minutes. Cut and remove twine.
5. To Finish Under the Broiler: Adjust rack to 6 inches from broiler element and preheat broiler to high. Heat butter swirling in a medium skillet over high heat until foaming subsides and butter turns a light nutty brown. Add thyme and shallots and stir until crackling stops. Pour butter mixture over tenderloin and spread with a spoon until all surfaces are coated. Remove shallots from top surface of meat. Place pan with tenderloin under broiler and broil turning every 30 seconds until meat is well browned on all sides and internal temperature registers 125°F (52°C) for rare or 130°F (54°C) for medium-rare about 2 minutes total. Proceed to step 5.
6. To Finish on the Stovetop: Heat butter swirling in a medium skillet over high heat until foaming subsides and butter turns a light nutty brown. Add tenderloin shallots and thyme and cook turning occasionally and spooning hot butter and aromatics over roast until meat is well browned on all sides and internal temperature registers 125°F (52°C) for rare or 130°F (54°C) for medium-rare about 1 1/2 minutes.
7. Transfer tenderloin to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Slice into 1/2-inch slices sprinkle with chives and coarse sea salt and serve with Horseradish Cream Sauce.
8. Notes:
9. For best results season and trim the meat and allow it to rest at least overnight uncovered in the refrigerator to improve seasoning browning and texture. A center-cut beef tenderloin is also called a chateaubriand. Ask your butcher for it or buy a whole tenderloin and trim it yourself reserving the ends for another use. Plan on 1/2 pound of meat per person.,

instructions, 1. Have on hand the following accessories: 1 large platter 2 dinner plates 1 cereal bowl 1 piece paper toweling.
2. The list of 8 spices at the end of the recipe make up the Emeril's Essence. These should be mixed together thoroughly before being added to the flour. For a larger portion of Essence that can be stored multiply all amounts by 4 and just add 1 tablespoon of Essence to the flour.
3. Chop up carrots celery and onion. Set aside. (This can be done the night before and all vegetables placed together in a baggie in the refrigerator.).
4. In cereal bowl combine flour and Emeril's Essence. (Emeril's Essence can be made up anytime in advance and stored.).
5. Cube meat into approximately 1 1/2" chunks on large platter trimming away excess fat as necessary. (Do not cube in advance or meat will be too bloody and not dry enough.).
6. Dredge each piece of meat thoroughly in flour mixture and return to platter.
7. Place pressure cooker on cooktop and apply medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil.
8. When olive oil is hot add approximately 1/2 of the meat cubes in order to saute. (Don't crowd meat. It will take 2-2 1/2 batches to cook meat.) Cook meat until well browned on outside but still pink on inside--about 3-4 minutes per batch.
9. When first batch of meat is cooked transfer to dinner plate wipe edges of pressure cooker with paper towel add some more olive oil and place second batch of meat in pressure cooker to saute. Repeat procedure until all meat cubes are browned.
10. Reduce heat under pressure cooker to medium-low. Add balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup stock. Deglaze pan.
11. Add carrots celery onion and garlic to pressure cooker. Add salt and pepper. Mix well and cook over medium-low heat for 3 minutes.
12. Remove all but 1/2 cup vegetables from pressure cooker and set aside on second dinner plate. Wipe down edges of pressure cooker.
13. Add to pressure cooker:  reserved meat bay leaves red wine and remaining beef stock. Mix well.
14. Place lid on pressure cooker. Heat on high until pressure cooker is up to full pressure. Reduce heat to simmer and cook at high pressure for 20 minutes.
15. While meat is cooking take a red potato slice in half the long way then slice each half the long way one more time. Make three cross-cuts on each potato "submarine" and keep pieces together in submarine shape on cutting board. Repeat process for second potato. (This method prevents the potato flesh from turning brown while you're waiting to add the potatoes to the stew.).
16. When meat has been cooked 20 minutes remove pressure cooker from cooktop and release pressure using the cold water method. Open lid and add remaining vegetables which have been set aside. Also add potato chunks. Mix well.
17. Replace lid on pressure cooker. Place pressure cooker on cooktop over high heat. Bring pressure up to high reduce heat to simmer and cook on high pressure for 10 minutes. At the end of 10 minutes release pressure using the cold water method again.
18. Remove lid from pressure cooker and enjoy stew.,

instructions, 1. BEEF: Rub each filet with garlic and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Saute filets in butter 3-4 minutes on each side. Flame brandy pour over filets (if this freaks you out don't flame the brandy). Remove filets and chill.
2. In the same skillet saute chopped mushrooms and chill. Mix pate with chilled mushrooms spread over filets and refrigerate.
3. MUSHROOM SAUCE: Using the same skillet over medium heat combine onion and sliced mushrooms stir in flour and gradually add wine broth and bay leaf. Stir until sauce bubbles and is thickened. Season with salt pepper and Worcestershire.
4. PASTRY: Roll out patty shells or dough and trim into 4 6-inch squares. Brush with egg. Place each filet pate side down on pastry. Fold dough completely over filets and seal edges with butter. Place seam side down on a greased baking sheet (with a rim) and brush again with egg.
5. Pastry may now be garnished with small flowers or leaves made from extra dough and attached using butter or beaten egg. Don't skip this step it is very impressive looking; even I will get out the small cocktail cookie cutters and stick on a few pastry leaves holly and berry or even hearts for Valentine's Day.
6. Bake at 425 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until crust is richly browned. Serve with heated mushroom sauce.,

2. Brown beef and onion in a large deep skillet over medium heat until done.  When done drain and return to pan.
3. Add in the teaspoons of basil garlic powder and oregano.   Then mix in the potatoes frozen vegetables tomatoes gravy salt/pepper and Worcestershire.
4. Reduce heat to medium-low cover and simmer until the potatoes are almost tender.  Stir often to prevent sticking.  (The potatoes will absorb and neutralize some of the spices so taste-test and add in more salt/pepper as needed).
5. Meanwhile unroll the pie crusts and cut circles slightly larger than the openings on the bowls.  Also cut slits in the crust to allow steam to escape.
6. When meat mixture is ready spoon into the individual bowls and top with the little pie crust circles.  Brush the pie crusts with the egg whites.  If desired you can then sprinkle extra herb on top.  (Parsley/Basil/Italian Seasoning/Oregano - Something green is pretty).
7. Bake for 30-35 minutes until crusts are golden brown.
8. *If you won’t be eating them all at once simply cover the meat mixture and put in the refrigerator.  Then when you are ready put the pie crust on the bowl brush with the egg white and bake until it is heated through and the crust is brown.  Perfect to make on a Sunday and eat during the week!
9. *To make one large pie spoon the mixture into a 2 quart casserole dish.  Cover with the uncut pie crust.  Bake at 425 degrees for 30-35 minutes until golden brown.,

instructions, 1. Season filet mignon with salt and pepper to taste. In a medium pan sauté seasoned filet mignon in high heat with butter. Reserve.
2. In a bigger pan brown onion with butter and then add the mushrooms and the reserved steak. Let it cook for about 5 minutes.
3. Add the soy sauce and the cognac (heated) and singe it.
4. In a bowl mix the table cream ketchup mustard salt and pepper to taste and the flour dissolved in milk and add this mixture to the steak and mushrooms and let it cook for 5-8 more minutes in medium heat until the sauce incorporates and thickens.
5. Turn off heat and serve the strogonoff with potato sticks white rice and a nice salad.
6. TIPS:
7. Beef: let the steak rest about 1-2 hours out of the fridge before preparing the dish. The beef has to sauté and not cook so it is best to brown it in high heat and don't let it release too much juice in the pan preserving its color moisture and flavor.
8. Heating up the cognac: Get a coffee cup half full of hot water and set a snifter across the top. It will heat it perfectly. Heating it in a microwave (no more than 5 seconds) open flame or steam should all produce the same end result.
9. Table cream: to take the watery part of the canned table cream let the can sit in the fridge for about 4 hours prior to using it and when you open the can it will be easier to separate the cream from the runny part. In doing that the strogonoff will be creamier and thicker.
10. If you use the fresh heavy cream let the sauce cook for a little more to thicken.
11. To freeze: this recipe can be made and frozen but do not add the table cream when freezing. After taking the prepared steak out of the freezer add the table cream and heat it up prior to serving.)
12. You may substitute steak for chicken breast shrimp cod fish and sliced tuna.,

instructions, 1. Prepare a heavy baking dish that is as close to the size of the beef tenderloin as possible by making an aluminum foil "basket" for it to sit inches It is VERY important to use heavy duty aluminum foil.

5. Carefully pull the pan out and turn the meat over. Broil for another 5 minutes or until cooked to desired doneness. (When the meat is done under the flame it will look like it is burned but it's not).
6. Wrap it up very tightly in the foil and let it sit and continue to cook inside the foil on the kitchen counter for about another 1 1/2 hours.
7. Whisk together the sour cream and horseradish and season with salt and pepper. Remove the string binding the roast slice the meat and serve with the horseradish sauce on the side.,

instructions, 1. Cut small slits into the roast about every 3 inches try not to pierce all the way to the bottom. Stuff the sliced garlic into the slits.
2. Season the Roast very liberally on all sides with the Salt & Black Pepper season with Cayenne to your taste I don’t use much.
3. Heat the fat in a heavy bottomed Dutch Oven over high heat when the oil starts to smoke wait a few more seconds then carefully add the Roast cut side down. Brown very well on all sides without burning it. Remove to a plate.
4. Drain off all but 1 Tbsp of the fat in the pan add the onions and carrots cook until the onions just start to brown place the roast back in the pan then add the stocks. Finish if necessary with enough water to bring the cooking liquid 3/4 of the way up the roast. Add the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil then back down to a simmer. Simmer covered for 3-4 hours or until the meat falls apart by staring at it.
5. For the Debris Gravy:
6. Mix the flour water/stock and seasoning in a jar or container to thoroughly mix all the ingredients you don't wants lumps of flour so shake it like crazy.
7. Carve the meat into very thin slices it will be hard to do and will fall apart that is good. All of the bits and pieces that fall off are your Debris (pronounced DAY-bree.) Add all of the bits and chunks to you cooking liquid.  Heat the liquid/bits until boiling no slowing add in the flour slurry mixture until you reach the desired thickness may need to add more stock/water if it gets too thick.
8. For the Po’ Boy:
9. New Orleans Style French Bread (Po’ Boys are generally about 9-10 inches long per sandwich. As you can see I made mine a bit smaller shame on me.) Cut the bread 3/4 of the way through leaving a hinge (as seen in the background of the pic.) I find the hinge makes for slightly easier eating.
10. Shredded Lettuce (or Cabbage a la Mothers).
11. Mayonnaise.
12. Roast Beef (see above).
13. Debris Gravy.
14. Slather the bread with a very generous portion of Mayonnaise on the inside of the upper and lower halves. Place about a cup of Shredded Lettuce on the bottom half. Cover the lettuce with a generous portion of the “sliced” Beef. Drown the beef with Debris Gravy.

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Be sure to let it reach its temperature before roasting the beef. Rub all sides of the beef with the vegetable oil then rub in the soy sauce if using and season with the pepper. Place on a rack over a roasting pan and sear in the hot oven for 15 minutes.
2. The internal temperature in the very center should be 115 degrees F. Immediately transfer the roasting rack to a tray (to catch the juices; do not keep over the roasting pan or the beef will continue to cook).
3. Set in a cool place to stop the cooking as quickly as possible. In a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag large enough to hold the beef combine the soy sauce mirin green onions garlic and lemon zest. As soon as the beef is cool enough to handle transfer to the bag and refrigerate for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours turning over occasionally.
4. PONZU SAUCE: In a bowl whisk together the soy sauce vinegar sugar lemon and lime juices and ginger juice. Keep whisking until the sugar dissolves.
5. About 45 minutes before you plan to serve place the bag in the freezer (this will firm the beef and make it easier to cut even slices). After 20 minutes remove the beef from the bag and discard the marinade.
6. Slice crosswise with a very sharp knife into 1/4-inch slices keeping them to an even thickness if possible. Fan the slices overlapping on a platter and let stand for 10 minutes. Drizzle with the Ponzu sauce and serve.,

time, ,

instructions, 1. You'll notice there is no salt in this recipe other than that used in the flour mixture; I typically use canned beef stock and I find it salty enough.
2. If you cannot find Rotel use a can of Mexican stewed tomatoes (but it likely won't have the kick); if you don't want any hot-pepper flavour in your stew use regular stewed tomatoes or just leave them completely out.
3. Canned stewed tomatoes are typically in larger tins than the Rotel but the extra won't matter; don't worry about it.
4. I use the Bouquet Garni spice from Penzeys for this which is a spice blend containing savory rosemary thyme oregano basil dill marjoram sage and tarragon; if you don't have a similar spice mix I recommend using savory rosemary and thyme to make up the two teaspoons.
5. Okay let's start the prep work.
6. First thickly slice the onions and place on a plate; on the side of the plate place the thinly sliced garlic cloves; set aside.
7. Next place the other vegetables in a bowl as you chop them and set aside.
8. Now you'll have to cube the beef if you haven't bought it already cubed.
9. In a clean plastic bag (check to make sure it has no holes) place the flour salt and pepper; shake the beef cubes in the flour mixture so each piece is lightly coated.
10. Preheat oven to 300F.
11. Now the cooking starts: get out a large Dutch oven and put in on your burner over high heat; lightly coat the bottom with olive oil.
12. Brown the beef cubes in the oil removing them to a plate as they brown--you will likely have to do this in about 3 batches depending on the size of your pot; add olive oil to the pot as needed.
13. When all the beef has been browned add the onions to the pot (adding some oil if needed to prevent them from burning or sticking) and let cook stirring a bit for about one minute; then add the garlic slices and stir them around for a minute.
14. Reduce heat to medium and add about 1/2 cup of the beef stock and about half of the wine; let bubble stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to get up and dissolve all the brown bits off the bottom of the pan (where a lot of flavour lives; you want that in your stew not on the bottom of the pot).
15. Now add everything else to the pot including of course the browned beef stirring well to combine.
16. Put the lid on the pot and place in the middle of the preheated oven and cook for a minimum of two hours (3 is even better); beef should be very tender.
17. Check and stir once every hour; after two hours taste the stew (be careful it's very hot) and add a sprinkle of salt if you think it needs it.
18. When done you can serve as is or thicken it on top of the stove with a little flour-water mixture if you wish; it all depends on your personal preference.,

10. Pour in 1 cup water and scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze it; spend time doing this because the flavor of the curry sauce will be determine by how well you free up any bits of meat or veggie.
11. Stir in the salt.
12. Once the curry comes to a boil reduce the heat to medium-low cover and simmer for 18-20 minutes until the meat is fork-tender.

2. Place beef roast in roasting pan on top of a roast rack so that it is not laying flat on the pan bottom.
3. Cover beef with montreal steak seasoning so that you don't even see the beef surface; if you don't have the seasoning you can sub salt and lots of fresh cracked pepper and maybe a touch of garlic powder (but it won't be exactly the same).
4. Roast beef for about 45 minutes to 1 hour depending on size; you can use meat thermometer to check if you like meat should be at medium rare.
5. Let meat rest for a few minutes; while this is going on mix 3 cups cold water with 2 packages brown gravy mix (a whisk really helps here).
6. After a few minutes slice roast beef as thin or thick as you like; my family likes it about a 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick.  Set aside a few slices for those who like their meat medium rare.
7. Drain pan drippings from roast pan into a large frying pan add gravy mixture stir until it starts to bubble.
8. Place roast beef slices that you want to be well done into pan with gravy cook and let gravy reduce a bit about 10 minutes or so.
9. Put well done beef and also saved medium rare slices onto a serving platter and drizzle last bits of gravy over all.  Enjoy!,

instructions, 1. *I use my cast iron grill pan for this so if using that turn your gas stove on to medium-low heat and get the pan heating. (Make sure it is lightly oiled first.) You can also do this in a Foreman Grill if you happen to have one or even a pan works just fine. ;).
2. Spread 2 slices hearty bread (even regular bread works ok too) with 2 Tbl. sun-dried tomato pesto. (1 Tbl. on each slice.) I just use my measuring spoon and then spread it on with the back of it.
3. Place a slice of havarti cheese on each slice.
4. On one slice scrunch up each slice of roast beef and pile on. It's so much better that way than just laying them on flat.
5. On top of the roast beef sprinkle on the chopped artichoke heart. (*My hubby hates them so I only put them on mine when I made this for us. So this is optional.).
6. Break your piece of bacon in half and lay the slices on top of the artichoke hearts.
7. Now just take the other slice of bread that you made with the pesto and cheese and flip it over on top. (Cheese-side down of course! :) ).
8. Brush top all over but lightly with a little olive oil.
9. Place olive oil side-down onto hot grill or pan.
10. Brush top-side with more olive oil the same way.
11. Toast at least 1 minute but check. You want it lightly toasted with nice grill marks.
12. Carefully lift up a corner with your spatula then get under it and turn it over.
13. Toast other side.
14. Remove the same way onto a cutting board and cut in half with a sharp knife on the bias or corner-to-corner.

2. Brown slightly add 3/4 cup water and other ingredients cut up into small pieces.
3. Simmer till beef is done.
4. My notes:
5. * This recipe was written when stew beef was the scribbly bits they cut off of everything else and was about the cheapest meat available.  I suppose you could use store-ground beef for the same reason; if so it should be drained before adding the other ingredients.  I used "beef for stroganoff" because it was the cheapest cut available that day.  The meat is cut small to cook faster.
6. * I think the recipe is calling for 1 green pepper chopped.
7. * I used the mushrooms undrained for a bit more liquid; it does boil away.
8. * The gravy is like an au-jus when you're done. I thickened it with a tablespoon of cornstarch to make a more substantial gravy.
9. * This is a sort of stove-top stew.  It predates Hamburger Helper.  It's not a bad recipe but could do with some tweaking.,

instructions, 1. Stovetop: Let soup base fully dissolve in water. Add all ingredients except the peas and barley. Bring to boiling then reduce heat and simmer 1 hour. Add peas and barley and continue cooking 1 hour.
2. Crockpot: Cook ingredients on low overnight and/or throughout the day. Turn to high and add peas and barley for last hour.
3. I usually use stew meat or round steaks for this recipe. Less expensive cuts of meat actually have more flavor than expensive cuts do and are great in soup.
4. This is a very forgiving recipe. You can change the recipe to suit your taste or what you have on hand. Can substitute rice or pasta for the barley just be sure to adjust the amount and cooking times of these accordingly. You can also add or omit any vegetables you desire. Just make sure to include the celery onions and carrots which is the base of the vegetable flavor in this soup. If you decide to use bullion instead of the soup base you may want to leave out the salt as it is pretty salty.
5. Bones give soup a wonderful flavor so if you buy a cut of meat that has a bone do not discard it. Throw it in the pot and remove it before serving along with the bay leaves.

instructions, 1. Place the potatoes in a large saucepan with water to cover by 1 inch. Add a generous pinch of salt and cook for 15 minutes or until tender. Potatoes cook quickly. Test often for tenderness and don't overcook them. Alternatively cook the potatoes in a pressure cooker for 5 minutes releasing the pressure immediately to prevent overcooking. Drain the potatoes and arrange them in a 6- by 9- by 2-inch casserole dish.
2. In a large skillet add a little oil to coat the pan. Combine the beef and onion and cook together over medium heat until the beef is browned and the onion softened about 10 minutes. Drain excess fat.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
4. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan and whisk in the flour to make a roux. Cook over medium heat whisking constantly until the mixture bubbles and the flour turns light brown in color. Gradually whisk in the milk and continue to stir while cooking over medium heat. When the mixture thickens season with salt and pepper then stir in the cheese and browned beef and onions.
5. Pour the ground beef mixture over the potatoes and bake the casserole for 20 minutes until heated through and bubbling. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs on top of the casserole and bake until the crumbs are toasted about 5 minutes longer.
6. Cook's Note.
7. Because all the ingredients are fully cooked if they are still hot when you assemble the casserole the baking time can be greatly reduced or even eliminated; simply brown the crumb topping under the broiler for a couple of minutes.,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 400°F Rub the oil into the beef then roll it in the cracked pepper.
2. Heat a large frying pan brown the beef all over then place in a roasting tin or on a baking sheet and roast in the oven for 20 minutes for rare 25 minutes for medium 30 for well done.
3. The trick to check how it is cooked is to press the meat firmly with your finger. If it is blue it will be very soft to the touch rare slightly firmer medium firmer still with some resilience and well done feels very firm. Allow the beef to rest for 5 minutes or so – you can add any meat juices to the sauce – before slicing.
4. To make the sauce poach the garlic in water for a minute or so drain then repeat with fresh water. Now poach the garlic in the chicken stock for 10 minutes or until soft.
5. Drain reserving stock. Return the stock to the pan bring it to the boil and reduce it by half.
6. Blend the garlic stock and remaining ingredients in a food processor then gently reheat.
7. Serve with some tenderstem broccoli and if you dare some chunky fries.,

instructions, 1. In a very large bowl mix up all ingredients except the meat and set aside.
2. If using a whole brisket separate the flat half and the point half put the point half away for another use (like smoking it). Trim all the fat from the flat half it needs to be very lean (You butcher may do this for you along with slicing it).
3. You can partially freeze this for easier slicing slice into 1/8 or slightly thicker. If you need to cut in lengths to fit your dehydrator. Or use a gas oven set on 145°F.
4. Add slices to bowl with the marinade with clean hands make sure all the meat is coated without any "dry spots". Press down the meat to remove air and bring marinade to the top.
5. Allow to marinade for about 4 hours stirring the meat a few times during this period to keep the meat coated. I use my hands washed of course then press the meat down again.
6. If you need more marinade just scale down the recipe and make a little more.
7. Place slices in the dehydrator and dehydrate according to manufacturers directions.
8. If using a gas oven (I didn't like the results from an electric oven) place several sheets of foil across the bottom of oven do not cover the heat vents heat to 145 F place slices directly on oven rack and close door.
9. Allow to dry for 6 to 8 hours. The jerky needs to be dry but still pliable NOT crunchy. It will bend but not break.
10. Store in an airtight container after it has cooled completely.
11. When you are eating this pretend your a cowboy on horseback in a cattle drive all you have to eat everyday is beans hard bread and beef jerky tear off a piece with your teeth jam in down between your cheek and gum suck on it for a minute or 2 then slowly start chewing the edge until it is gone. LOL or just enjoy it however you like.
12. I call this jerky "Cowboy Style" because it is very tough and chewy if you do not like tough jerky then use whatever meat you prefer. Round roast works well just make sure the cut you use is very lean and trimmed of all fat. Fat can turn rancid.,

instructions, 1. Place Salt and Pepper (at the top) into a spice grinder and blend together.
2. Drizzle 2 TBS olive oil into all sides of your beef tenderloin.  Rub salt & pepper mixture onto the tenderloin.
3. Preheat Oven to  500 degrees.
4. Heat 2 TBS Olive Oil in a Pan to High Heat.    Sear all sides of the tenderloin in the pan until brown.  This should only take 1-2 minutes per side.    Place tenderloin into a roasting pan and cover in aluminum foil.  Place in oven for about 25 minutes.
5. Check the temperature after 25 minutes.  Place the thermometer into the center of the tenderloin.    It should register about 125 degrees for rare 145 degrees for Medium and 160 degrees for Well-Done.  I prefer mine in the 130-135 degree range (Medium-Rare).  Remember that once you remove from the oven and allow to rest the temperature will continue to rise for a few minutes.
6. Once the meat has cooled cut into thin slices. I often like to cook the meat a day in advance and slice the day sandwiches are served.
7. Slice your bread into serving sizes.   I personally love to do this in mini sandwiches (4x4) but do any size you prefer.   These even make great big tailgate sandwiches.
8. Mix together the mayonnaise horseradish mustard salt and pepper.  I often like to also add a drizzle of olive oil when whisking together for additional flavor.
9. Spread Mayonnaise sauce on both sides of each bread slice.
10. Place sliced tenderloin on bottom of sandwich and top with Havarti cheese tomatoes and arugula.    Feel free to use a pretty toothpick if serving mini-sandwiches at a party.
11. Enjoy!,

Add the onion and cook another 5 minutes  Place strainer over crock pot and strain the sauce well; flipping the onions and gently smashing with a spoon till the sauce is all in the crock pot.  Discard cooked onion.  Cook on High for 3-1/2 Hours.  Turn temperature to low and cook another 1-1/2 hours.  Take the meat out of crock pot with serrated spoon. Pull meat apart with two forks into large chunks. (Can be cooked on low for 8 hours.).
2. Cut rolls lengthwise  --  I always cut so that the top is thinner than the bottom.  Take a spoon and spoon some of the sauce onto both the top and bottom of the roll and spread quickly so the roll doesn't get mushy.    Broil for a  moment to heat up the roll.
3. Add sauce to the shredded beef in a bowl.  Spoon the saucy shredded meat onto the warm rolls.
4. I serve with potato salad green beans and apple sauce.  Enjoy!,

2. Slice onions and sautee in a large pot until golden then add 1/2 cup of water and cook for an additional 5 minutes.  Remove from pot.
3. Place half the carrot matchsticks into the pot to form the first layer then cover with a layer of the onions then a layer of drumsticks/meat cubes and finally another layer of the remaining carrots.  Sprinkle with the sugar and black pepper then add 1 cup of water and bring to a boil.  Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
4. Wash the rice three times in a sieve until it is no longer starchy then add as the top layer in the pot.  Sprinkle with salt and cover with water until it is about 1cm above the rice layer.  Cover and cook until the water has been absorbed.
5. Using a flat utensil flip the rice over like a pancake and using the handle of a wooden spoon burrow holes into the rice layer (they should not have water in them).  Pour water into the holes and cover again first with a towel and then with the lid.  The rice gets cooked by the steam that forms in the pot.  Check it again after 15 minutes to see if the rice is fully cooked and the water has evaporated.  If the water evaporated and the rice is not fully cooked repeat the flipping-hole drilling-water filling procedure.  If the rice is cooked but the water has not evaporated drill a few more holes.
6. When you scoop the food out to serve you should get rice topped with a pile of carrots onions and meat/chicken on top of it.,

cuisine, Latin American >> South American >> Argentine, 
time, ,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (375°F).
2. Slice your peppers in half cutting straight down through the stem. In other words the peppers will then lay on their sides not on their bottoms. Scoop out the seeds and any white bits inside the pepper so that you have a nice open dish to add the filling.
3. Before starting the filling it’s a good time to start boiling water and let the rice cook while you are doing the next step.
4. In a deep frying pan sauté the pine nuts onion and garlic on medium heat until semi-soft (the pine nuts should brown slightly).
5. While they are sautéing you can toast your cumin seeds. This is not a strictly necessary step but it adds a warm smoky taste to the dish that is unbeatable and it’s very simple to do. Place a small saucepan or frying pan on a very hot burner. Pour the seeds in and shake the pan around as they toast. This needs less than a minute if your burner is hot. They will quickly darken and pop. As soon as this starts to happen remove them from the heat.
6. Now add the chopped mushrooms and tofu (if using) along with your spices including the cumin seeds. If you’re using ground beef you might cook it separately and add it to the sauce at the end. Once the mushrooms are fairly soft (about 5 minutes) add in the tomatoes corn cooked rice cumin seeds and other spices. Stir this mixture together until well combined and let it cook a few minutes more.
7. Pour a small coating of water into the bottom of your baking dish (a dish large enough to hold 6 pepper halves). Place the peppers inside the dish and pour the filling into each of them rounding it off a bit at the top. Cover the dish with foil and place it in the oven for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes remove the foil raise the heat slightly and return to the oven for another 15 minutes or until the tops start to brown and the peppers start to wither. You can place shredded cheese on in the last 5 minutes.,

2. Add about 4 inches of water to a tamalera or large (5-gallon) pot. (You may have to use two pots if you don't have one big enough to hold the baho in one batch.) Place a rack in the bottom of the pot or toss in enough wadded up aluminum foil to hold the ingredients out of the water. Place a plate on top of the rack or aluminum foil.
3. Line the plate and the sides of the pot with banana leaves letting the leaves hang over the edge of the pot. Make sure the pot is fully lined with leaves with no openings.
4. Lay the green and ripe plantains on the bed of banana leaves. Remove the meat from its marinade and layer it over the plantains.
5. Top the beef with a layer of yuca.
6. Finally pour the meat marinade and vegetables over the yuca.
7. Take the banana leaves hanging over the edge of the pot and fold them over to completely cover the ingredients in the pot.
8. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.
9. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high flame. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for about 4 hours.
10. Add water as necessary to keep it from all evaporating.
11. Baho is traditionally served on a banana leaf. Each diner gets a piece of ripe plantain a piece of green plantain a piece of cassava and a portion of meat. This is all topped with a healthy portion of repollo cabbage slaw.
12. *Variations.
13. Banana leaves can be found frozen in most Latin or Asian markets. If you can't find them use aluminum foil instead. You'll be missing out on the flavor the banana leaves give to the dish though.,

instructions, 1. Put the sugar in a small glass bowl and add about half of the water. Sprinkle the yeast on the surface of the water and do not stir. Allow to set while measuring the rest of the ingredients. The yeast water and sugar will begin to get a little foamy.
2. Meanwhile measure the flour salt and baking powder into a pile on a large sturdy work surface. Combine the dry ingredients together a little with your finger tips. Don't worry it will all get thoroughly mixed later.
3. Make a hollow in the center of your pile of flour—like the middle of a volcano. Now give your sugar water and yeast a quick stir and pour it into the center of your flour volcano. Be careful that it doesn't get away from you. Now with your finger tips move it all around until the liquid is pretty much soaked up. Then add the remaining water in the same way.
4. You should have a messy wad of ingredients that you can get your hands into. Work all remaining flour into the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic. If it's obviously too dry make a small indent in the dough and add a couple tablespoons more water and work it inches If it's too sticky toss a little flour on the surface and work it inches You can tell when it's right if you pick it up by one side and it very slowly stretches on its own. It's right when it feels really nice to work.
5. Now the fun part. Here's where you get your therapy. Kneed the dough for a full five minutes. Fold it. Turn it. Push it. Punch it. Really work it. If you don't cheat on this part you'll have a really nice consistency in your bread.
6. After your five minutes of fun form it into a little mound cut an X in the top with a knife and pop it in an oiled bowl and cover with a damp towel. Let it sit in a warm place for 2-3 hours or until doubled in size.
7. Heat your oven to about 400°F When dinner is about 30 minutes away turn your dough out on your work surface punch it down and kneed it for a minute. Divide it in half with a knife and form two mounds. Oil a cookie sheet or large baking tray. Stretch your dough into a 16-18 inch round. It will be about ½ inches thick. Don't worry about getting it perfect. Just stretch it however you like.
8. Pop the first one in the oven for about 15 minutes or until golden. Remove the tray and turn the flat bread bottom up to cool just a bit. Form another round and bake the second one while you enjoy the first. You'll need the second!
9. You can slice this flat bread if you like but it's much more fun if you just tear it apart! This easy bread recipe goes great with stews soups salads beans meats pastas almost anything.,

7. Tie the lump in a cheesecloth put it on a strainer put the strainer to hang over the empty casserole and put a small lid with a weight over the cheesecloth for the complete draining.
8. Put the casserole with all the stuff into the refrigerator for 8-12 hours. The longer you keep it there the drier it gets (personal preference matters).,

instructions, 1. For the Cabbage Filling:  cut the cabbage into quarters. Steam until very tender about 15 minutes; drain and cool. Wrap cooled cabbage in a towel and squeeze out as much liquid as possible.  Simmer finely chopped onions in butter and chicken broth until the onion is translucent - add the cooled cabbage salt and pepper. Let simmer until heated.  Stir in the cream cheese and dill (or substitute caraway seeds if you prefer).
2. Instant Potato and Cheese Filling:  Sautee the onion and butter in a small pot until the onion is translucent.  Add enough water based on the instant mashed potato package directions (I would guess but every brand is different) and add the chives.  Once the water has boiled remove the pot from the heat and add the potato flakes cheese and cream cheese.
3. Ground beef filling:  In a large frying pan simmer the finely chopped onions in the butter and cook until the onions are translucent. Prepare the ground beef by combining and kneading it with the hunter’s seasoning (see below).  Add it to the onion mixture chopping it with your spatula so it doesn't cook together.  Cook until all of the pink is gone.
4. Hunter’s seasoning recipe:  Make as much or as little as you want using this ratio.  This will make more than the 3 tablespoons amount but I don't know what the ratio would be for exactly that amount.  I always make a jar full and keep it on hand since it's a good general meat seasoning for beef or poultry.   2 teaspoons Marjoram 1 teaspoons peppercorn 1 teaspoons caraway ½ teaspoons garlic powder 1 teaspoons onion powder 1 teaspoons Allspice to taste Cloves to taste 1 crushed bay leaf 1 teaspoons Juniper berries (A difficult thing to find you can substitute this by adding a few shots of gin to the ground beef while kneading; gives it a great flavor and all the alcohol will cook out).,

In a large pan place cabbage leaves and fill with water until the leaves are covered. Bring to a boil and let cook on medium heat for 15 minutes. Reserve a cup of the water you cooked the leaves in to cook the cabbage rolls inches Drain leaves and then cool them down with cold water. Drain again.
4. Divide stuffing mixture into 9 equal parts and spread it into the middle of the cabbage leaf. Roll the bottom of the leaf over the mixture. Fold each side into the center and roll up. Place into a 9 inch glass casserole dish with lid. Pour the reserved liquid from the cabbage leaf water on top of the rolls.
5. Place into oven and cook for 1 hour or until fork tender. At mid baking time take them out of the oven and turn them over. Place back in the oven.

instructions, 1. Add vodka to hot chocolate/cocoa (if you want more of a kick you could try adding plain vodka so the raspberry flavor won't overpower the chocolate).
2. If desired garnish with whipped cream. Note: I I have tried combining the hot chocolate with vanilla vodka and Kahlúa and obtained equally delicious results!,

Hint: winter can be tough. You can place the bowl of dough over a bowl of hot water covered with a rack to support the bread bowl. Cover the bowls with a towel to trap warmth from the water like a tent. This helps it rise better in the Winter months. 1-1/2-2 hours.
5. 5 Remove dough from bowl after it has risen double in size. Punch the dough down with fist. Divide the dough in half. Lightly flour surface. Roll each half of dough in to a rectangle 12 x 15 inches long.

instructions, 1. Mix yeast with warm milk add flour and blend until smooth. Allow the dough to rise in a warm place (for about 2 hours).  If using the oven/stove for other cooking you can turn on one burner at very low heat just enough to create some heat.  Put the dough in a bowl covered with a thin washcloth  on the adjacent unlit burner or in the center of the stove to rise.  It will also rise at room temperature but works better warm.
2. Mix eggs salt and sugar and 1 tablespoon oil into the dough and allow to rise again (for about 1/2 hour). Without mixing dough again use a wet spoon to spoon out portions of dough onto a greased hot pan.  Dollop out with a soup spoon the pancakes are small.  About the size of a sand-dollar or teacup circumference.  They rise like blini but unlike blini are not thin they should rise about 2-3cm tall.
3. Cook on both sides until golden brown.
4. Serve immediately with preserves and sour cream (or creme fraiche).  Also good with honey farmer's cheese or fresh fruit and sugar.  Or any combo you like!,

2. Using electric mixer on medium speed cream the butter and cream cheese together in a medium mixing bowl until light and fluffy 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Stop the mixer once or twice to scrape the bowl with a spatula.
3. Add the dry ingredients and mix until blended about 20 seconds stopping the mixer once to scrape the bowl.
4. Shape the dough into 2 equal thick rectangles wrap each one in plastic wrap and freeze for 2 hours.
5. Remove 1 dough rectangle from the freezer and roll it out between 2 pieces of plastic wrap into a rectangle about 9"x8". It may be necessary to refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes duriing the rolling process because it will become a bit sticky. Once rolled refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes.While it is resting remove the second rectangle from the freezer and roll it out the same way you did the first one.
6. To fill the dough unwrap one rectangle and place it on plastic wrap on a work surface. Spread half the preserves evenly over the rectangle leaving uncovered a 1/2" strip along the length of one side.
7. Mix the cinnamon and sugar together. Sprinkle half the cinnamon sugar nuts and raisins over the preserves.
8. Loosen the edge of the dough that is covered with jam with a knife or spatula and roll it toward the uncovered edge like a jelly roll peeling off the plastic wrap as you roll. The seam should be on the underside. Wrap the roll in plastic and refrigerate it. Repeat the process with the other dough rectangle. Keep the filled rolls refrigerated for 2 hours.
9. Fifteen minutes before baking preheat the oven to 375*F. Line 2 cookie sheets with wax paper or lightly grease them with butter or veg. oil.
10. For the glaze lightly beat the egg with a fork. Use a pastry brush to apply the glaze to the outside of the roll. Using a thin sharp knife carefully cut the rolls into pieces about  1 1/4" long.
11. Place the rugalah about 1" apart on the cookie sheets.
12. Bake the rugalah until golden about 25 minutes.(Some of the jam will ooze out and start to darken.) Use a spatula to remove the rugalah from the pan immediately and place them on a rack to cool. When they are cool place them in an airtight container for a day before serving so that the taste and consistency have a chance to settle.

instructions, 1. Boil beets with skin on about 1 hour or until easily pierced with a fork. If a beet is older or really big it may take longer. The smaller younger beets may cook in 45 minutes. Let cool in cold water (or in the fridge overnight if you want to make the beets ahead). You can make them 2-3 days ahead and refrigerate until ready to use! Anyway once they are at room temp or cool enough to handle peel off skin. Most of the time it should come off easily when you rub the beet with your hands (use kitchen gloves to keep from staining your hands).
2. Use a mandolin to julienne your beets or torture yourself and try to cut the matchsticks by hand. Just be prepared for really gnarly looking red finger nails if you don’t have a mandolin. Wear kitchen gloves if you are fond of your manicure. Place your  sliced beets in a large bowl and top with 1/4 cup finely diced red onion.
3. Add in 1/4 tsp salt 1/2 tsp sugar 1 tbsp vinegar and 3-4 tbsp real mayo to taste. Give it a good stir. You’re done!,

instructions, 1. In a Dutch oven brown the meat and onion.
2. Chili or other ground beef can be broken up as it cooks otherwise cut the meat into cubes or strips half an inch thick or so.
3. Drain it when browned.
4. While the meat is browning boil a pot of water for the noodles.  Ideally you want the water to boil just after the meat is browned.
5. Also while the meat is browning cut up the cream cheese so it will melt easier.  As soon as the meat is in the strainer to drain put the cream cheese into the Dutch oven over medium heat to melt.
6. Once it melts acceptably (don't wait for it to become liquid just soft enough that it'll mix in) add the other ingredients except the noodles.
7. Stir thoroughly until it forms a horrible-looking goop.  (If it's an awful shade of brown or gray don't worry-- that's what it always looks like.)
8. Add Worcestershire salt pepper and any other seasoning to taste.  (I usually go wild with the Worcestershire but it's up to you.)
9. When the water comes to a boil throw in the noodles and prepare as per the package.
10. Add the meat to the sauce at this time as well.
11. Once the noodles are done dish it up like spaghetti.,

instructions, 1. For making the dough:
2. Sift the flour with the salt onto a smooth clean surface.
3. Start adding the mixture of the liquids into the pile of flour in small amounts trying to incorporate the liquid into as much flour as possible each time.
4. After a while all the flour will be moistened; keep adding the liquid in small amounts kneading the dough very vigorously after each time.
5. The dough might seem soggy right after you add the mixture but after you beat it for about minute it takes in the moisture out and more has to be added actually.
6. Keep adding the liquid until the dough becomes mixed throughout very evenly soft enough to manage but resilient to the touch and very stretchy. I usually have 1 or 2 ounces left of the water mixture after the dough is done.
7. Roll the dough into a ball wrap in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for about 30-40 minutes.
8. For the filling: to save time you can load all the ingredients into a good food processor with a meat-cutting blade and ground them evenly but not too finely.
9. Add seasonings to taste.
10. Now you are ready for the fun part.
11. To assemble pelmeni first you have to make thinly rolled circles of dough.
12. You may roll out large portions of dough and cut the circles out with a glass or roll out the pieces of dough separately.
13. The dough should be very thin approximately 1/32 of an inch and look translucent.
14. While one person is making the circles the others can be putting the filling by tablespoons onto the middle of each circle and sealing the meat tightly.
15. Fold the circle over in half squeeze the edges together all the way around and gradually pinch the edge down as you would on a pie crust until it looks like a braid.
16. To make the process go faster you can use Pelmeni mold.
17. When you are wrapping please make sure there are no holes in the dough if there are holes the meat tends to be hard after cooking.
18. As you are making the pelmeni put them onto a flour-dusted plate and keep dusting between layers so they dont stick together.
19. To cook the pelmeni bring a large pot of salted water or broth (for better flavor) to a boil and load you pelmeni into the pot.
20. They will be ready when they float to the top.
21. Take the pelmeni out with a strainer and serve hot drizzled in butter with lemon juice vinegar and sour cream in separate dishes to be used as a garnish.
22. You could also add a small salad made of coarsely chopped tomatoes and cucumbers in sour cream to add some refreshing color and a burst of vitamins.
23. If you feel you have made too many pelmeni feel free to freeze them before they are cooked; they keep in a freezer for a very long time.,

instructions, 1. In a food processor pulse the farmerï¿½s cheese until it is uniformly crumpled.  Add the eggs sugar salt and ½ cup of flour.  Pulse or mix to combine.  Refrigerate 1 hour or even overnight.  The dough will remain thick but sticky.
2. Put approximately 1/3 cup of flour into a bowl and use this to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands.  Using 2 teaspoons drop 1½ï¿½ balls of dough into the flour roll them round and flatten to about 3/8ï¿½ thick.  Place them on a plate in a single layer until all the patties are all formed.
3. Heat a frying pan with 1 T. butter and fry the patties on each side until golden.  You will need to add more butter as you go.
4. Serve hot with sour cream and/or jam.  This recipe will make approximately 20 small patties.
5. NOTE:  Farmer Cheese is usually found near the cream cheese; my store sells Friendship brand.  These days the packages are just under 1/2 pound (don't you hate this incremental downsizing?) and 2 packages will work fine.
6. About the Times Prep time is mostly frying time and Passive time is the chilling time.,

instructions, 1. In a cast iron pot or dutch oven (any heavy pot that's moderately sized not large) heat oil and sautee the onion until translucent.
2. Add meat with bones and sear on all sides.
3. Add little bit of water and braise. Don't let it dry out add more water as you need to continue braising (if you don't have time and prefer stewing it's OK but you can't let the meat drown in water and at the same time you can't let it dry out. Be gentle.)
4. Add the paprika and garlic. Braise it for total of 45min or until meat is soft.
5. Some cuts will require longer braising times (no shortcuts meat has to be tender and a little bit of brown sauce needs to develop).
6. Stir and stir don't let anything stick just add some more water to make sure you're getting a sauce. Remember we're working with very little oil here.
7. Add the cumin seeds (preferable toasted and crushed).
8. Now that the meat is soft add your parsley carrots salt 1 cup of rice and 2 cups of water. Mix well and cover.
9. Let cook for about 30-40min on low heat until all water is absorbed.

instructions, 1. Combine first 7 ingredients to form a very thick batter.
2. (Original recipe calls for 1/2c flour and crumbs but even with double the flour mine was too sticky to roll.).
3. Heat oil in a wide frying pan.
4. (According to Good Eats more oil is better since the oil is absorbed when oil temp drops which happens when too much cold stuff is added to not enough oil. I used enough to fill the pan with 1/3 of an inch).
5. Use a tea-spoon to quickly scoop and drop dough balls. Since the batter is pretty thick use your finger to make the drop.
6. Alternatively form balls roughly 1" in diameter then drop into oil.
7. Do not crowd the pan or drop so many that you won't be able to flip them comfortably.
8. Fry past golden-brown about 90 sec. Adjust oil temp if needed.
9. Flip using 2 forks.
10. Fry the other side.
11. Carefully lift each Kolobok out  onto racks lined with paper towels sprinkle with powdered sugar.

8. Roll reserved piece of dough into an 18-inch-long rope on work surface with palms of your hands. Cut rope into 3 equal pieces and lay pieces vertically side by side on work surface about 1/4 inch apart. Gather 3 ends farthest from you and press them together then braid strands pressing together other ends to secure braid. Lay braid over top of dough in soufflé dish (trim braid if using coffee cans). Form another loaf with remaining dough in same manner.
9. Cover loaves with clean kitchen towel and let rise in draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled in bulk about 1 1/2 hours (loaves will rise about 1 inch above rims of dishes).

3. Mix the curd (cottage) cheese yogurt sugar 1 tablespoon of lemon juice add warm cream and 5 sheets of gelatin (remainder of the gelatin powder). We divide the mass into three parts.

4. One of the small parts of the batter is mixed with 4 tablespoons of blueberry juice (no berries).
5. The second small part of the batter is mixed with berries. The third bowl (with the 50%) is left white.
6. First we pour the most dark layer (with berries) into the form on top of the cookie crust. We put in the refrigerator until the layer thickens. (give it an hour  then check it to see if it is set enough to take the weight of next layer).
7. Then GENTLY add the second layer of batter containing juice without berries. Again put in the fridge and wait until it thickens.
8. Finally gently add the white part of the batter and put it in the refrigerator for 4 hours. Before serving cheesecake is best decorated with fresh berries.
9. Of course blueberries in the recipe can be replaced with other berries - for every taste and color. It remains only to enjoy the wonderful result.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Grease a 9 x 13 inch baking pan.
3. Line bottom of baking pan with 1 can of the crescent rolls.  Pinch your seam together to seal.  Slightly moist fingers will help your fingers not stick to the dough and will also help to smudge any holes together.
4. In a medium bowl and using your electric beater mix together cream cheese white sugar lemon juice vanilla and sour cream until whippy.  Spread this filling on top of the rolls.  Sprinkle walnuts on top of the filling. Sprinkle dark brown sugar over walnuts.
5. Place second can of rolls on top of filling.  I recommend pinching the seals closed instead of pressing because of the unstable filling.  However the layer of nuts will help a little here.
6. Bake in preheated oven for approximately 25-30 minutes or until the crescent rolls appear.  If you want a glossy top you can brush with beaten egg white during the last 10 minutes of baking but this is not necessary.only prettier.
7. In a small bowl stir together confectioners' sugar milk and butter.  After Danish has cooled drizzle with icing. Avoid serving hot because filling is sticky and it will burn your mouth!,

instructions, 1. Take the first 3 ingredients only: 4 ounces butter 1 cup flour and 2 tablespoons water; rub the butter into the flour; add the water. You will have a soft and slightly sticky ball.
2. Spread this mixture out onto an unbuttered baking tray (cookie sheet) to an approximate 5 to 7 mm thickness.
3. This recipe makes one tray size pastry that you cut into slices afterwards rather than individual pastries that I now understand Americans might be used to.

5. Take off the heat mix in all the second quantity of flour (1 cup) all at once.

7. Add the almond essence and all the eggs at once and stir until your mixture is a smooth glossy paste.
8. Spread the second mixture evenly over the first mixture.
9. Bake at 180 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Fahrenheit) for approximately 45 minutes or until light golden brown and topping is a little bit crisp.

3. When rice is firm remove from heat and let cool. When cool add vanilla sugar sugar and almonds.
4. Fold in whipped  cream.
5. Chill and serve with warm raspberry sauce.
6. SAUCE:.
7. In medium sauce pan place frozen raspberries and 2 tbsp of water heat until thawed add sugar and stir. Let simmer for approx 3-5 minute.
8. Mix cornstarch with water and add to the sauce to thicken. This step can be omitted if you want a more natural and thinner sauce.
9. TIP- you can also serve this dish with a strawberry sauce or a mix of raspberry and strawberry. I prefer the raspberry sauce as it adds a bit of tartness to an otherwise sweet dish. Traditionally the dish is served with a cherry sauce our family never did though instead preferring the raspberry or strawberry sauce.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. To make the icing combine Splenda powdered sugar and cornstarch in a small microwave-safe bowl. Add 1/2 tablespoons cold water and the vanilla extract and mix until ingredients have dissolved. Add Marshmallow Creme and microwave for 5 seconds or until creme is soft enough to fold into mixture. Stir until smooth. Add Cool Whip and stir again until evenly combined. Refrigerate icing until you're ready to ice the Danish.
3. In a medium bowl combine cream cheese oats Splenda soymilk (or skim milk) and almond extract and stir until thoroughly mixed. Fold in cherries and set aside. This is your filling.
4. Spray a large baking sheet with nonstick spray. Lay out your dough on the sheet and (using a rolling pin a can or your hands) lightly roll it out into a long rectangle of even thickness. Arrange baking sheet in front of you so that the short sides are on the left and right and the long sides are on the top and bottom. Spoon cherry filling lengthwise across the middle third of the dough leaving 1-inch borders on the left and right of the filling.
5. Along the top third of the dough cut slits down from the top of the dough toward the filling stopping about 1/2 inch away from the filling -- space slits about 1 inch apart from each other. Repeat on the bottom part of the rectangle cutting upward toward the filling. This will create 1-inch-wide strips of dough on both the top and bottom of the filling.
6. Starting at one side alternate folding the 1-inch strips from the top and the bottom over the filling covering filling completely and creating a criss-crossed "braided" appearance. After all the strips have been folded fold the short sides of the dough in toward the filling so filling cannot escape and pat firmly to seal.
7. Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes until pastry is crispy and golden brown. Allow to cool for at least 15 minutes.
8. Just before serving drizzle entire Danish with icing. Cut into 9 slices and indulge! (P.S. Refrigerate leftovers.).,

instructions, 1. Make the butter roll-in first.
2. With a pastry blender or two knives (using two knives is actually easier) cut the flour and the 3 sticks of butter together until combined but do not let the butter become warm.  The butter should never be allowed to become warm the entire to time you are working with this dough.
3. Tear off a sheet of waxed paper and dump the butter on to it.  Place another sheet of waxed paper on top.
4. Beat the the butter between the two sheets of waxed paper with a rolling pin until it becomes malleable.  Make sure it stays cold though.
5. With a spatula a knife or whatever shape the mound of butter into an 7"x9" rectangle.  It doesn't have to be perfect but try to get it into a rectangular shape as best you can.
6. Set aside in a cool spot or place back in the refrigerator while you make the dough but don't let the butter re-harden.  You want the butter to be cold but still soft and pliable.  If it's too hard it will break through the dough when you roll it out.
7. For the dough combine the packages of yeast with the warm milk and let sit 5 minutes to soften.
8. Mix in the salt sugar and eggs.
9. Add the 3 1/4 cups flour all at once and stir until thoroughly combined.  You should have a very soft and sticky dough.
10. Chill dough in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes.
11. If the block of butter is in the refrigerator remove it when you place the dough in there to chill.  You don't want the butter to re-harden and it's best if the dough and the butter are approximately the same temperature.
12. Sprinkle your work surface generously and I do mean generously with flour.  I use a shaker to evenly distribute the flour and completely cover the area I'm going to be rolling the dough out on.  A simple dusting won't do.  You need a good thick layer of flour maybe as much as a 1/16 to an 1/8 of an inch thick.  Don't worry about using too much flour because any excess will be brushed away with your pastry brush.
13. Roll dough out into a 11"x16" rectangle.
14. With a pastry brush brush all the excess flour off the top of the dough.  Excess flour will interfere with layer formation.
15. Place the block of butter on one side of the dough leaving a small border around the edges.
16. Fold the other half of the dough over and pinch the seams together slightly to seal to encase the block of butter. If dough sticks to the table when you try to fold it then simply brush it with flour.  Don't worry if the dough doesn't look too pretty at this point.  It will get better.
17. Turn the dough 1/4 turn so the part of the folded dough that opens up is on your right(like a book).  Brush away the excess flour that's on top of the dough.
18. Roll the folded dough into an 8"x20" rectangle.  When you roll out the dough you want to make sure you use even strokes and roll from one end to the other.  Avoid quick back and forth movements with the rolling pin and do not roll over the edge of your dough.  This will destroy the layers you're trying to make.  If the butter breaks through the dough simply sprinkle a little bit of flour over the spot.
19. Brush away all excess flour off the top of the dough.
20. Fold 1/3 of the dough over and brush off the excess flour and then fold the other 1/3 of the dough over that so the dough resembles a business letter.
21. Roll out the dough again and fold it in thirds like a business letter just like you did before.
22. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.  This completes the first  two "turns".  Each time you roll out the dough and fold it you are doing what's known as a turn.  A turn gets its name because after you fold the dough you have to turn it a quarter turn when you go to roll it out again.  Each time you roll out the dough you want to make sure that the part of the dough that opens up is always on the right (like the way a book opens).  It can open on the left if you want but the important thing is to be consistent.
23. Meanwhile take your pastry brush and a sheet of paper and sweep up all the flour on your work surface so you can use it again.  You'll find that very little of the flour you used to roll out the dough actually gets worked into the dough.
24. After the dough has chilled sprinkle your work surface with your recycled flour and place the dough on it.
25. Roll out and fold the dough in thirds exactly as you did before.  (turn #3).
26. Chill dough for 1 more hour.
27. Repeat this rolling and folding one more time (turn # 4).  You should now have a dough with 162 flaky layers (2x3x3x3x3). You started with two layers of dough separated by a layer of butter.  Each time you rolled the dough out and folded it in thirds you increased the number of layers by a factor of 3.
28. Chill dough for at least 3 hours or overnight if preferred.  At this point you have a basic Danish pastry dough.
29. With a sharp serrated knife cut the dough in half.
30. Keep one half in the refrigerator while you work with the first half.
31. Roll the half of dough into a 9"x16" rectangle.
32. Sprinkle the top of the dough with the cinnamon topping which consists of 2 tablespoons of melted butter 1/2 cup brown sugar 2 teaspoons cinnamon 2 tablespoons flour and 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans.
33. Roll dough into a tight 16" long log.
34. Cut dough into 16 pieces.  The easiest way to do this is to cut the log in half and then cut those halves in half and so forth. If dough is too soft to slice wrap it up and refrigerate it for an hour or place it in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes.
35. Place cinnamon rolls on ungreased baking sheets at least 3 inches apart so they have room to rise and expand.
36. Repeat with the other half of the dough.
37. Cover the trays of cinnamon rolls with towels and set aside to rise until the rolls are ALMOST doubled (about a 75% increase in size). Don't put them in a warm spot because you don't want the butter to melt.  Rising time may take a few hours or more.  After a couple hours the surface of the rolls may start to dry out especially if the air is dry.  If this happens cover the tray of rolls with a damp paper towel and then put another towel on top of that.
38. Brush rolls lightly with egg wash and bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until they are golden brown. Be sure to watch them carefully so they don't burn.  If rolls are browning too fast on top lower the oven temperature about 15 degrees.  If you have thin or dark colored baking sheets you may want to double-pan them so the bottoms of the cinnamon rolls don't get too dark.
39. Drizzle powdered sugar icing over the rolls while they are still warm.
40. To make icing simply combine powdered sugar with a teaspoon or two of vanilla and enough milk so you can drizzle it.  I usually use about 3/4 to 1 pound of powdered sugar.  As far as the amount of milk goes I just kind of eyeball it.,

instructions, 1. 1. First you need to salt your fresh salmon fillet to extract some of the moisture. This will enable it to take on the smoky flavor more easily and cook safely. Cover the base of a dish with about 1cm of salt and place the fillet skin side down on the salt. Sprinkle some dry dill onto the fillet followed by a generous amount of salt making sure to cover the fish completely with more salt on the thicker parts. Leave it in a cool place for 2-3 hours.
2. 2. Remove the fish from the now damp salt and wash it thoroughly in cold fresh water.
3. 3. Place the fillet on a drying rack for at least an hour and preferably more.
4. 4. Fill your smoker with beech oak or fruit wood sawdust having soaked a hand full of the sawdust in Whiskey (don't use your best Hebredean single malt for this).
5. 5. Place your fillet in the smoker and gently smoke for 12 hours. A brief hot smoke (about 60-80 degrees) of about 30 minutes followed by a long cold smoke (under 30 degrees C) works well. I used an insulated smoker like this one http://www.outdoorcook.co.uk/collections/smokers/products/professional-meat-fish-smoker  but there are loads of different types around and you may even be able to use your BBQ although insulation is important to maintain lower temperatures and an electric element or gas makes for easier use.
6. 6. Remove the fillet and check  it is cooked through before serving. It can be eaten in leafy salads with boiled new potatoes on bread with pasta and all it needs is a bit of Lemon juice to bring it alive!
7. 7. Enjoy.,

6. Cooling the eggs under cold water stops them from cooking further and prevents a dark ring forming around the yolk.
7. For easy peeling peel the eggs under cold running water over a colander to collect all the bits of shell. The water stops the shell from sticking to your fingers and the egg.,

instructions, 1. Pre-heat oven to 180C/350F/gas 4.
2. Grease and line with baking parchment three 7" or 8" round Victoria sandwich tins.
3. Cream the butter vanilla extract and sugar together until pale and fluffy - this is very important it captures air and keeps the cake light and moist!
4. Add the beaten eggs gradually mixing well each time. Lightly sieve in the flour - again gradually - and then add enough milk to make the cake mixture a dropping consistency.
5. Divide the mixture between the three cake tins - giving them a gentle shake to level them and bake in the pre-heated oven for about 25 - 30 minutes or until well risen and a pale golden brown. Turn the cakes out and leave to cool on a wire rack.
6. Whip the cream until thick and holding soft peaks and add the vanilla extract if using.
7. Sandwich the cakes together with the cream and sliced strawberries - reserving at least 8 for the top of the cake.
8. Place the cake on an atractive cake or gateau serving platter/stand and sprinkle the icing sugar over the top of the cake.
9. Decorate with the reserved whole strawberries.
10. N.B. you can also decorate the top of the cake with the whipped cream - but this is not traditional!,

instructions, 1. Butter 8 slices of bread and make sandwiches with the grated mature cheese and sliced onion. Cut the the sandwiches into four triangles and arrange them standing up with the points to the top in a well greased baking dish. (Do NOT use standard American style sandwich bread it is too thin and will not crisp up!).
2. (Feel free to vary to contents of the sandwiches. If it doesn't have to be a vegetarian dish some ham would be very nice. Or you might want to put some pickle on the sandwiches some sliced tomatoes cooked sausage or whatever you fancy.).
3. Beat the eggs with the milk mustard powder salt pepper and the herbs.
4. Pre-heat oven to 200C or 400°F.
5. Pour the egg custard mixture over the sandwiches. (If you had any cheese left over sprinkle it on top. Onion too if you have any left over.) Allow the pudding to stand for about 30 minutes before baking - you get a lighter pudding.
6. Bake the bread and butter pudding in the pre-heated oven for about 20 to 30 minutes or until the cheese custard has set and the cheese on the top is golden.
7. In a nutshell - it's cheese sandwiches with savoury custard poured over then baked in the oven - or savoury bread and butter pudding!
8. Serve warm for breakfast brunch lunch or supper. Can be prepared the night before and baked next morning - bring it to room temperature for about 30 minutes before baking it however.,

instructions, 1. Put the peeled and chopped potatoes in to a pot and cover them with boiling water. Bring back to the boil and simmer for around twenty-five minutes until they are soft. Drain them well and return them to the empty pot.
2. Add the butter to the potatoes and mash them thoroughly before adding the sieved flour in two or three stages stirring well with a wooden spoon. When the mixture has come together to form a dough cover and allow to cool.
3. Lightly flour a chopping board or clean surface and if making circular tattie scones as I have done separate the dough in to three pieces before forming each in to a ball and rolling out to a thickness of approximately 1/4". If traditional shaped tattie scones are required simply roll out the whole piece of dough and cut in to the required shapes.
4. Add a little vegetable oil to a non-stick frying-pan and bring it up to a medium heat before adding the tattie scones. Ensure that the heat is not too high or the scones will brown on the outside while still being raw and unpalatable on the inside. The tattie scones should take around three minutes on each side to cook and nicely brown.
5. When the scones are ready they can either be eaten straight from the pan allowed to cool and enjoyed with such as butter or jam or even re-heated at a later time as part of perhaps a traditional Scottish breakfast. They should easily keep for two or three days in an airtight container or in the refrigerator.,

3. On lightly wheat-floured surface roll the dough out to about 1/8-inch thick.  If needed use ice water as "glue" to patch it together- It might fall apart a little. Cut into rounds with a large cookie cutter or the top of a glass about 2 1/2" in diameter.  Or you can cut it into squares with a knife.  Place on and ungreased baking sheet.
4. Bake until the oatcakes start to brown about 12-15 minutes.  Cool a bit on a wire rack if your gang will wait that long.
5. To serve top with whatever you find in your kitchen.  These are not sweet so they make a great base for sweeter toppings like jelly and honey.  Other toppings we've use are peanut butter butter sliced fruit cream cheese and coconut.  I think we even used chocolate chips a time or two.  Use your imagination!

instructions, 1. For the Mignonette sauce: Combine all the ingredients togther in a jam jar or sealed container - shake thoroughly and allow the flavours to mingle for at least 1 hour before serving.
2. Serve (in a little bowl with a small spoon) with freshly shucked oysters.
3. Excess sauce can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
4. How to open the oysters: Hold an oyster firmly with a cloth in one hand.
5. and the hinged end towards you. Insert a knife in the area where the two.
6. shells meet and prise open with a twisting action. Slide the blade along the inside edge of the shell to sever the muscle holding the shells together. Cut the muscle attachment to lower shell. Turn the oyster meat for best presentation.
7. NB: The best way to serve raw oysters is on a platter of crushed ice or sometimes you see them presented on a bed of seaweed.
8. At a dinner party allow 6 oysters per person as a starter.
9. A live oyster uses its muscle to hold the shells tightly closed. When an oyster weakens the shell gapes open and if it will not close when tapped it should be discarded.
10. Oysters will keep for up to one week if stored correctly deep shell down in a fridge or cool place. Cover with a damp cloth to prevent dehydration. Never store in water.
11. Oysters can be frozen for up to 3 months just as other fish products. The shells will open on thawing BUT CONSUME STRAIGHT AWAY.
12. Champagne is possibly the best drink to serve with oysters or Bucks fizz if eating oysters for breakfast.
13. Other wines that go well with oysters are light dry and slightly acidic wines like Muscadet.
14. As the wine has to compete with the salty natural flavour of oysters a fuller bodied wine distracts from both the taste of wine and the oyster.
15. In Ireland you will always get served oysters with Guinness and a very dry cold sherry in Spain.
16. Personally I like Sancerre Vouvray or Chablis with my oysters!,

instructions, 1. Preheat the grill to hot and toast the bread on both sides. Spread a little mustard on each slice then top with the cheese laying the slices of cheese as close as possible to the edges of the toast. (Pile the grated cheese over the top evenly again as close to the edges as possible.).
2. Sprinkle over the Worcestershire sauce to taste then pop the cheese on toast under the grill. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until golden and bubbling.
3. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately with Branston pickle chutney relish and/or pickled onions.
4. Serves 2 to 4 depending on "greed level" and hunger! Alternatively serves an impoverished student as a main course meal!
5. Tip - for full flavour use a mature Farmhouse Cheddar and good quality thick sliced bread – I prefer white but granary and wholemeal are fine.
6. Final note - Cooking Style.
7. There are generally two schools of Cheese on Toast Chefery those who use grated cheese and those who use slabs of cheese. It has even been suggested that peoples personality is reflected in how they cook their cheese on toast.
8. Slabbers are direct and focused. The key for them being that is quick easy and generates minimal washing up.
9. Graters tend to be more extravert and creative. They will spend minutes piling extra cheese onto each piece of the toast. Most of this cheese will fall off the toast when its inserted under the grill. Slabbers tend to think that the amount of grated cheese piled on a slice of toast is inversely proportional to the chance of being made to clean the grill pan.
10. Obsessive Slabbers. An obsessive slabber will arrange the slices of cheese to totally cover the bread not overlap the sides of the bread and not overlap each other.
11. Warning:A Slabber will generally be happy to be given a plate of grated Cheese on toast but Graters always look disappointed with slab Cheese on toast!  Relationships have ended over this point.,

4. Notes on Borage: Borage is a traditional herb used as a diuretic diaphoretic and anti-inflammatory. It was also thought to relieve symptoms of melancholy. Borage is a native of the Mediterranean but is well adapted to growing in British soils.
5. These days borage is rarely used in cooking or grown in the common herb garden. It is a beautiful plant with delicate blue flowers. The leaves flowers and stalks of borage are edible however borage is a voracious grower and can take over a garden very quickly. This has lead to a decline in its popularity as a garden plant and also as an ingredient in meals.
6. Using Borage in Cooking.
7. Borage is a versatile herb in the kitchen; its leaves stalk and flowers are edible. The young fresh leaves have a mild cucumber taste and can be added to salads used in stocks soups and stews or brewed to make a refreshing tea. You could also try adding them to sandwiches instead of lettuce or chopping them and adding them to cream cheese or yogurt. When cooked borage leaves may be used as a substitute to spinach. Don’t be put off by the fine white hairs on the leaves as once in the mouth they quickly dissolve. They also disappear when cooked.
8. Borage flowers are beautiful and both look and taste fantastic in salads. They can also be preserved or candied. Why not try freezing some in ice cubes and adding them to drinks or simply floating the blooms in a glass of lemonade?
9. The stems of borage are used to flavour a number of alcoholic beverages including Pimms No. 1. In Spain the stems are parboiled and fried in batter. Chopped up they make a great addition to soups and can also be eaten raw; giving a hearty crunch to salads.,

instructions, 1. Begin the night before by weighing the fruit and peel into a bowl and sprinkling it with the 3 tablespoons of whisky. Mix well cover and leave overnight.
2. Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 3 325°F (170°C). Put the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until light and fluffy – or use an electric mixer for more speed. Whisk the eggs separately then a little at a time beat them into the creamed butter and sugar. Next using a large tablespoon carefully fold in the sifted flour and baking powder. Your mixture needs to be of a soft dropping consistency so if it seems too dry add a dessertspoon of milk.
3. Now carefully fold in the ground almonds and then the currants sultanas cherries mixed peel and orange and lemon zest. Then spoon the mixture into the prepared cake tin smoothing it out evenly with the back of the spoon. If you don't intend to ice the cake arrange the whole blanched almonds in circles on top of the mixture but do this carefully and lightly; if they are pressed in they will sink during the baking. Place the cake in the centre of the oven and bake for 2-2½ hours or until the centre is firm and springy to the touch.
4. Let the cake cool in the tin for 30 minutes before taking it out to finish cooling on a wire rack. Then 'feed' it – make small holes in the top and base of the cake with a cocktail stick or small skewer then spoon over a few teaspoons of malt whisky – wrap it in double silicone paper and store it in foil or an airtight container till needed. If you like you can feed it again before icing or eating.,

instructions, 1. Put the oatmeal or oats in a heavy-based preferably non-stick pan and cook over a low heat stirring constantly until they are toasted and golden.  Allow to cool before use.
2. Meanwhile pour the cream into a mixing bowl and whip until soft peaks form then gradually whisk in the honey and whisky (if you are including this).  Set aside.
3. After you have removed the stems washed and carefully dry the raspberries place a few raspberries in the base of 4 dessert glasses top with a little cream mixture and sprinkle with some oatmeal or oats.  Continue layering the raspberries cream and oatmeal finishing with a layer of raspberries and oatmeal.  Chill until required.
4. Notes: To prevent the oats from becoming soggy chill the cream mixture at the end of step 2 and assemble the desserts just before serving.
5. Alternative:  For slightly larger serves with more of the creamy mixture use 150ml of double cream and 150ml of yoghurt mixed together with honey and whisky then whisked into the blended cream/yogurt.  The yogurt I always buy is a very creamy slightly sweet Greek yogurt which I get at a local delicatessen.  When I make this recipe I intend using this instead of cream.,

instructions, 1. Preheat oven to 300°.
2. Cream butter and sugar together.
3. Add flour and mix till texture is like clay.
4. Press dough into ungreased 9 x 13 inch pan prick all over with a fork and sprinkle with sugar (tilt pan to cover the top evenly then shake excess sugar back into the sugar canister).
5. Bake for about 40-45 minutes (till very lightly browned--just golden around the edges).
6. Let stand for 5 minutes then cut into 24 squares while warm.
7. Leave in pan to cool thoroughly. (Shortbread will not be crisp until cool.).
8. Less easy method: Chill dough. Roll into 1-inch balls then press balls to about 1/4-inch thickness on ungreased cookie sheets with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar (sometimes you can find a glass with a pretty design on the bottom like a star). Bake at 300° for about 20-25 minutes (until edges are very lightly browned).
9. Least easy method: Chill dough. Roll out to about 1/4-inch thickness sprinkle with sugar then cut with cookie cutters. Bake on ungreased cookie sheets at 300° for about 20-25 minutes (until edges are very lightly browned).
10. Variation: Add 2 tablespoons dried lavender to the creamed butter and sugar before adding flour. It may sound strange but the flavor is subtle and elegant.  Food-grade lavender is usually available in herb bins at health food stores and I recently found it at a great price from Atlantic Spice online (their Lavender #1).
11. Variation: After cutting shortbread into squares (it will still be warm) scatter 1 cup of chocolate chips over the top let the chocolate soften completely then spread as a thin layer and let cool completely before removing from pan.  (No need to sprinkle shortbread with sugar before baking if you plan to do this.).
12. Variation: Stir 1 cup chocolate chips or butterscotch chips into the dough before pressing into pan. You can also try melting the butterscotch over the top as above. In England you'll find "caramel shortbread" which has a layer of caramel and a layer of chocolate on top of the shortbread. It's wonderful (of course!). I've tried various ways of doing this and various kinds of caramel but it's been a while and I don't remember what works best.  It can be tricky not to make a mess!,

instructions, 1. Combined method for cooking the Roast Beef and the Yorkshire Pudding:
2. Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.
3. Put the joint of beef into a shallow baking tray or tin.
4. Season the meat to taste with a little salt and black pepper and English mustard powder if using.
5. Melt half of the beef dripping and pour over the meat and seasoning.
6. Roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes and then reduce the heat to 190C/375F/Gas 5 for a further 1 1/2 hours. This will give you rare roast beef in the middle.
7. When cooked put the meat in a warm place to rest for 20-30 minutes before carving and serving and then turn up the heat to 240C475F or gas mark 9.
8. Pour the remainder of the beef dripping into a cake baking tray (The type of baking tray used to make small cakes / muffins). Put the tray with a little bit of dripping in each of the depressions in the tray into the oven for 3 minutes or until you see the dripping smoke.
9. Remove from the oven and pour 2 tablespoons of the Yorkshire Pudding batter (see below for batter recipe) into each cake depression and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until well puffed up and golden brown. DO NOT Open the door for the first 10 minutes!
10. Meanwhile carve and portion the beef on to hot plates and make a gravy using the juices left in the roasting. As soon as the Yorkshire pudding is ready serve with mustard and horseradish sauce roast potatoes and seasonal vegetables.
11. To make the Yorkshire Pudding Mixture (Batter):
12. Sift the flour into a large bowl.
13. and add the beaten eggs into the centre of the heap of flour.
14. Mix the water and the milk together in a jug. Pour the mixture slowly onto the flour and egg. As you start to pour the water/milk slowly beat the mixture together with a whisk. Add the salt and continue to beat. The puddings will be lighter if the batter includes a little air.
15. Once all the ingredients have been beaten together leave to stand covered by a cloth for 40 minutes or so.
16. Now you are at 'step 8' in the main cooking method. Your oven should be very hot and your tray for the puddings very hot.
17. Tip: The bigger the joint the better the meat and it should always be cooked on the bone. The meat should have a good covering of fat be dark red in colour (which shows it has been hung properly) and have a good marbling of fat throughout.
18. Sprinkling some English mustard powder over the top of the meat gives a great crust and a fabulous taste.,

4. Place the pudding into a pot of boiling water which should come halfway up the side. Cover and simmer gently for 4 hours. Occasionally check and top up the water if necessary.
5. Once the pudding is cooked plunge it into cold water for about one minute to release it from the cloth. Remove the pudding to a bowl and untie cover with a plate and reverse it. Peel off the cloth and place the pudding into a hot oven to dry off the surface. Serve hot with your choice of dessert sauce - custard brandy butter hard sauce etc.
6. Any left-over Clootie dumpling may be sliced  then fried or wrapped in foil and reheated in a warm oven or loosely covered with paper towel and reheated in a microwave.,

instructions, 1. CHECK LIST: a sifter nest of bowls food processor or electric beater spatula wooden spoon 24 cm round cake tin baking paper brown paper and twine rolling pin thin metal skewer.
2. STAGE 1.
3. To make your own almond paste you will need a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Don't be tempted to use store-bought almond paste because it contains lots of sugar and few almonds it will turn to liquid under the grill.
4. Place icing sugar and almonds in food processor bowl. Process slowly dripping in egg yolk orange juice and almond essence. The mixture should form a pliable paste.
5. Set aside a small portion for balls with which to decorate the cake.
6. Roll out the remaining paste into 2 circles which are the approximate size of the tin. Set aside.
7. STAGE 2.
8. Preheat oven to 160°C/320°F.
9. Use a sturdy non-stick cake tub or line the buttered base with baking paper. As the baking period is long (1-1 1/2 hours) prevent the cake drying out by wrapping a double thickness of brown paper around the pan and securing it with twine.
10. Sift flour salt and spices together then stir in fruit and peel.
11. Cream butter and sugar thoroughly until light and creamy then beat in eggs one at a time until the mixture is fluffy. (Reserve a drop of egg yolk for brushing over top layer of almond paste.).
12. Stir flour and fruit into creamed mixture (you may need to add a little milk to give the mixture a dropping consistency).
13. STAGE 3.
14. Place half the mixture into a greased and lined cake tin.
15. Place one pre-rolled round of almond paste over the top.
16. Cover with remaining cake mixture. Before baking the cake give the pan of mixture a sharp tap on to a firm surface. This settles the mixture and prevents holes from forming in the cake.
17. Bake in the centre of the oven for 1-1 1/4 hours or until a thin metal skewer inserted in the centre of the cake comes out without a trace of stickiness.
18. Level the cake by placing a weighted plate on top of the cooked cake while it is still hot.
19. Turn out cake on to a wire rack after leaving it to settle in the cake tin for between 10 and 15 minutes. Peel off paper and leave to cool completely.
20. STAGE 4.
21. Cover the top of the cake with a second round of almond paste. Roll 11 small balls of paste and place evenly around the top of the cake. Brush the top with a little beaten egg and very lightly brown under the grill until the almond paste turns light golden brown.
22. Remove and leave to cool.,

instructions, 1. Heat the oven to 180C/360°F Lightly butter 8 x 3" ramekin dishes. I like to spray them to coat them evenly.
2. Soak the dates in the boiling water for about half an hour to soften them. Add the bicarbonate of soda vanilla essence and coffee mixture mix well and allow to soak for 30 minutes more.
3. In a separate bowl beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy then add the beaten eggs a little at a time and beat well after each addition. Fold in the sifted flour again a little at a time gently mixing through after each addition.
4. Then add the date mixture. You should have a fairly sloppy mixture it looks all wrong - but it is ALL right I promise you! Divide the mixture equally between the ramekins place them on a baking tray and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until well risen.
5. Cool for 5 minutes then loosen them around the sides with a butter knife and turn out. The puddings can be cooled and frozen at this stage. After freezing defrost pour the hot sauce over and re-heat to serve as instructed below.
6. To serve:- Place the puddings in a shallow ovenproof dish. Heat the grill. Make the sauce by melting the butter cream pecans and sugar together in a pan and stir well.When just boiling pour HALF of the sauce over the puddings; and then continue to heat the sauce on a rolling boil until it has thickened.
7. Place the puddings 5" below the grill and cook for about 8 minutes making sure that the nuts and sauce does not burn too badly; you should have toasted nuts in places with a sticky toffee glaze which is almost crunchy.
8. Serve with the extra toffee sauce in a heatproof jug chilled cream custard ice-cream or just NAKED!,

5. Press the dough over the bottom of prepared pan (do not pack to tightly).
6. Bake for about 20 minutes or until crust is golden around the edges.
7. In a medium bowl whisk together all the filling ingredients (except the powdered sugar) until smooth.
8. Remove the crust from the oven and pour the filling over the hot crust.
9. Return to the oven and bake until the filling begins to brown around the edges and is JUST set and springy to the touch (around 25-30 minutes).

12. **NOTE** if you want to remove the bars from the baking dish before slicing them place a piece of buttered foil on the bottom of the dish (leaving an overhang of foil) before patting in the crust mixture. When the bars are COMPLETELY cool remove them with the foil overhang my advise would be to place the bars in the fridge before removing them with the foil to avoid breakage of the crust.,

7. Whilst they are cooling make the icing.
8. I like this to be pale violet in colour and to run off the cakes slightly - not too thick. So add the water to the icing sugar and gradually add the food colouring until the desired colour has been reached. The icing should be fairly loose but not too runny.
9. Top each fairy cake with the icing - it does NOT matter if it drizzles down the sides of the cake cases!
10. Top each fairy cake with a little sprig of lavender before the icing's set dry.,

instructions, 1. On a low heat slowly heat the sugar syrup butter and milk in a large heavy bottomed pan until all the sugar is dissolved.
2. It is quite important to make sure the sugar is dissolved before turning up the heat as it will not set properly.  Hints to make sure all the sugar dissolved.  Clean round the side of the pan with a pastry brush and boiling water.  Dip a desert spoon in to the sugar liquid and if it comes out with no grains of sugar then  the sugar is dissolved.  Another test is to listen when stirring with wooden spoon to hear if the sound is grainy if it no longer sounds grainy then the sugar is dissolved.
3. When the sugar has disolved add the whisky.
4. Bring to Boil until the temperature reaches soft-ball stage (240º F or 115º C).  Soft Ball Stage is when a spoonful of hot syrup is dropped  into a bowl of very cold water. Then using your fingers in the water take the cooled syrup and form it into a ball. If it has reached soft-ball stage the syrup can be easily rolled in the cold water into a soft ball that doesn't hold its shape.
5. When the mixture has reached the correct temperature take the pan off the heat.
6. Beat the mixture until it is grainy. This is a faint sound that is made from the mixture against the pan when it has been beaten and slightly cooler.
7. Pour into a Swiss roll tray.
8. Leave to cool.
9. When part set mark into bite size portions.
10. Continue to leave the mixture until it is cold and set completely.

For larger cakes use a 12-hole bun or muffin tin (these are 6 1/2 cm at the rim and 2cm deep). You can use the little paper cases according to the size tin you have - I have suggested silver. If not butter the base and sides of the holes before filling with the mixture.

instructions, 1. The measurements for this recipe are equal amounts of sugar flour and fat to the weight of the eggs; Recipezaar will not allow me to post that as a measurement. Therefore weigh the eggs first - if the eggs weigh 8 ounces you will use 8 ounces of sugar 8 ounces of butter or margarine and 8 ounces of flour. If the eggs weigh 6 ounces all the other ingredients will be 6 ounces - easy!
2. Set oven Gas 4 160C (fan oven) 180C or 360F: grease and base line the bottom of 2 x 8” sandwich tins - cake tins.
3. Cream margarine or butter together with the sugar until light and fluffy.
4. Beat the eggs and then add them to the mixture gradually and beating well after each addition.
5. Sieve the flour and fold into the mixture with a metal spoon.
6. Divide equally between the 2 prepared tins and bake for 25 minutes in the middle of the oven.
7. Remove and allow to cool for 1-2 minutes.
8. Remove from the tins and fill with raspberry jam (and cream if using)  when cold to avoid the cream melting or the jam seeping into the sponge.

11. Cook's Notes.
12. If you use butter remove from the fridge to soften before using. This is not necessary with soft margarine.
13. If large eggs are used they may weigh 7 ½ ozs/210g. If so make sure you use this weight for the other ingredients.
14. A smaller sandwich cake can be made with 2 medium eggs. Weight about 4 oz/55g. If so use 2 x 7” sandwich tins and the cakes and the cakes will need less time in the oven – probably 20mins.
15. Alternative measurements:
16. 3 eggs.
17. 6 ounces soft margarine or butter.
18. 6 ounces caster sugar.
19. 6 ounces SR flour.
20. Proceed as above for method.,

instructions, 1. Preheat your oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. You will need a deep baking dish roughly 26cm x 20cm I use an enamelled dish as Jamie does it conducts the heat perfectly.
2. Put your lardons or ham in a large sauce pan (that has a lid) over a medium heat and add your thyme leaves. Add a glug of olive oil and the butter and let it all fry off a few minutes. Add all of your prepared leeks and fry them off for about 3 minutes so they are well-coated in the butter. Add a pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper then pop the lid on turn the heat down to low to medium and let them cook away gently for 30 minutes stirring every 5 to 10 minutes to make sure they don’t catch.
3. When your leeks are ready add the turkey meat and stir. Add your stuffing mix now if you have any then add the flour mix it in well and then pour in your stock and stir again. Add the crème fraîche then turn the heat up and bring everything back up to the boil. Have a taste and add a bit more sea salt and freshly ground black pepper if it needs it then turn the heat off.
4. Pour the mixture through a sieve over another large empty pan and let the wonderful gravy from the mixture drip into the pan while you roll out your pastry.
5. Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with a bit of flour and roll your pastry to the size of your dish.
6. (Optional Chestnut and Sage Version. Roll the pastry out so it’s about double the size of your dish then crumble the chestnuts over one half of the pastry then tear a few of the sage leaves over the chestnuts. Fold the other half of pastry on top then roll it out carefully and evenly so you have a rectangle big enough to cover your baking tray. Don’t worry if a few bits stick out here and there.).
7. Spoon that thick leek and turkey mixture from your sieve into the pie dish and spread it out evenly. Lay your pastry on top tuck the ends under then gently score the pastry diagonally with your knife. Add a pinch of salt to your beaten egg then paint this egg wash over the top of your pastry. Pop your pie in the oven for about 35 to 40 minutes or until the pastry is puffed up and golden brown.

instructions, 1. Optional: Soak cranberries in the orange juice to plump them while you make the dough for a few minutes a few hours or overnight before starting the recipe.
2. Mix dry ingredients together then cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Stir in orange juice and cranberries. Mix lightly until dough comes together. If it seems too dry add more orange juice but just one spoonful at a time.  Texture should be like biscuit dough.  Don't overmix.
4. Dump the dough out on an oiled or floured surface. Oil or flour your hands  pat the dough together then divide into four balls.
5. Place each ball on an ungreased cookie sheet (or use a little cooking spray just on the spots where you place the dough) then smooth and flatten each one to a 6-inch round about 1 inch thick.
6. Sprinkle rounds with sugar if desired (it makes the tops sparkly--I use demerara sugar if I have it).  Using an oiled knife cut each round into 6 wedges.
7. Bake at 425 degrees for about 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned.  Let cool on pan for a few minutes then use a small serrated knife to separate the scones and transfer them to a rack or cloth-lined basket.
8. You can also make drop scones by dropping spoonfuls of dough onto a cookie sheet. (I like to use an ice cream scoop--the kind that will push the dough out.  It makes them round and consistently sized.)  These don't bake so long (maybe 15 minutes) so watch them closely.
9. I have normally made these in a heavy-duty mixer (Bosch) and when I had to make them by hand it was much more challenging to avoid over-mixing while getting enough liquid incorporated.  The finished texture was quite different.  I had to bake them longer because they were doughy in the middle and then they got too brown.  So perhaps if you don't have a mixer you should pat them thinner (maybe 3/4 inch) and add a little more baking powder to help the rise.,

2. Sift flour and then measure the 2 cups of flour. Add salt to flour and sift again.
3. Gradually add to the creamed butter mixture until you have added all the flour and mixture is smooth. Mix the coconut into the cookie dough.
4. Shape into a one and half (1.5) inch diameter roll and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until it the dough is firm about 2-4 hours or for several days until ready to use. May be frozen for later baking.
5. Using a sharp knife cut 1/4 inch slices from the cookie dough roll and place on a very lightly greased cookie sheet about 1 inch apart.
6. Bake at 300 degrees for about 20 minutes until a light golden brown at edges but not browned entirely across the top.
7. Cool cookies on sheet just until they are set easy to remove and have cooled slightly usually about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove cookies with a spatula and place on the 1 cup of powdered sugar that you have sifted onto a piece of wax paper or similar surface. Cover cookies with powdered sugar on all sides by sifting more sugar over them or "rolling" them in the sugar. After they have cooled and the powdered sugar has "set" you can coat them with more powdered sugar if you would like. Cool completely and then store in an airtight container for however long you can keep them from being eaten!
8. Try these the first time following the recipe as given. The next time you can play around with adding other ingredients to tweak these to your exact tastes. Some ideas toasting some of the coconut before adding to the dough adding finely chopped macadamia nuts ginger cardamom or any citrus zest. Key lime zest and macadamias is a great combo truly a cookie that takes you to tropical islands without the frequent flier miles :).,

instructions, 1. Heat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius or gas mark four. Then start melting 40g of butter in a big pan. Keep the heat low. Add the chopped chicken fillets to the pan.
2. Then add the chopped leeks (you don't have to wait for the chicken to cook - just chuck the leeks in after it). Fry for two to three minutes on a medium heat. Now add 40g plain flour to the mix. Stir everything thoroughly and cook for another two minutes.
3. Now pour in the milk and the chicken stock and keep stirring for five minutes or so until the mixture gets thick and creamy (make sure you keep stirring or it'll stick to the bottom of your pan). Add salt and pepper to taste and then pour the mixture into a pie dish.
4. Next roll a piece of puff pastry until it is just larger then the pie dish and around half a centimetre thick. Place the pastry on top of the pie mix pressing the edges into the dish. Any off cuts of pastry can be used to decorate the pie. A little milk or water will help your decorations stick to the rest of the pastry (I use some of the beaten egg).
5. Finally brush the top of the pie with a beaten egg and place in the oven for around 35 minutes or until the pastry is risen and golden.,

instructions, 1. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
2. Wash and cut the marrow in half then peel strips of skin with a swivel head vegetable peeler to create a striped pattern; scoop out all the seeds and discard them. Prick the inside flesh thoroughly with a fork.
3. Put all the stuffing ingredients together in a large mixing bowl and mix together - I find that it is better to use your hands to bring it all together. (Wet your hands before you start to prevent the mixture sticking to your hands!).
4. Spoon half the stuffing mixture into each half of marrow pressing down quite firmly to make the mixture fill the hollows.
5. Carefully place one stuffed marrow half on top of the other half - see photos - and press together before wrapping in a large sheet of well greased foil. (I use a low fat olive oil spray to grease my foil.).
6. Place the foil wrapped stuffed marrow into a large baking tray or ovenproof dish and cook in the pre-heated oven for 1 1/2 to 2 hours checking after 1 1/2 hours. The marrow should be soft but still hold its shape. (If you use a smaller or larger marrow please adjust the cooking time).
7. Take the marrow out of the oven when cooked and allow to sit for 5 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and serve hot cut into slices with the juices from the dish poured back over the marrow or mixed into your tomato sauce if making. Serve with steamed fresh vegetables and mashed potatoes. Garnish with fresh parsley.
8. This is also wonderful when served with a hot tomato sauce. Gently fry one finely chopped onion with a clove of garlic in a pan until soft and golden; add a tin of chopped tomatoes gently heat for a further 5 minutes check for  seasoning and add juices from the marrow salt pepper to taste. Allow to cool slightly and then blend the sauce in a blender or with a hand held immersion mixer until smooth. Gently re-heat and serve with the stuffed marrow.,

cuisine, European >> UK >> Scottish, 
time, , 
source, , 
instructions, 1. If the ham or gammon needs soaking place in cold clean water and soak overnight or for up to 24 hours.
2. Boiling the Ham:
3. Place ham joint in a roomy saucepan - there should be plenty of space to add the liquids plus the vegetables and spices.
4. Stick the cloves into the onion halves - 5 cloves in each half.
5. Pour in the cider if using and top up with water - the liquids should just cover the ham.
6. Add the onion halves carrots bay leaves and black peppercorns.
7. Bring to the boil and remove any scum that rises to the surface.
8. Reduce the heat and cook on a rolling simmer for 20 minutes per lb plus 20 minutes extra; a 3 lb ham will take 1 hour and 20 minutes to cook.
9. Take off the heat and allow to cool slightly.
10. Take out the onions and discard the cloves. Skim out the black peppercorns and discard them as well as the bay leaves.
11. Allow to cool completely; the ham can be stored in its cooking liquor in a cool place for up to 48 hours now before baking.
12. Before baking remove the ham and set aside. Skim off any fat that has risen to the surface of the stock it will be easy once the stock is cold.
13. Take out the carrots and onions and chop them up finely then add them back to the stock.
14. The stock can be frozen now or kept in the fridge for about 3-4 days before being cooked and used for soups or a stew base.
15. Baking the Ham:
16. Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F or gas mark 6.
17. If the ham has any skin peel the skin off and discard it trim any excess fat off the joint as well.
18. Take an ovenproof dish large enough to take the ham with ease; skewer the sliced oranges with the cocktail sticks all over the surface of the ham.
19. Spoon over the marmalade and then spoon the sugar over the oranges patting it down firmly.
20. Bake in the oven for between 30 and 45 minutes for a 3 lb ham - or until the glaze is sticky glossy and the oranges are slightly caramelised.
21. Serve slices of ham with some of the marmalade glaze over the top garnished with a slice of orange. (Be careful to remove all the cocktail sticks before serving!).
22. You can make extra glaze by heating up some marmalade with a little water or cider in a small saucepan and serving it in a gravy boat.
23. Wonderful with boiled or mashed potatoes steamed greens or red cabbage. We often eat this with sauerkraut as well!,
